Just bot a 2018 Forester with cvt transmission. I no more than got it home and the car would cut out 1-2 seconds or more from a stop or slow movement. Apparently this can be a problem with some cvt transmissions. It is dangerous in close traffic or pulling out into oncoming traffic. Took it back to the dealer who told me it takes a while for the car to get used to my driving habits. I cant buy this. Once the car cuts out it starts back up with a sudden jerk forward. This is unacceptable and am considering envoking the lemon law. Also the spedometer is set back under a cover and is hard to read.,neg
"This is the noisiest car I  have ever owned.  Terrible wind noise through the windows and the sun roof.  I consider the steering to be dangerous, as it almost pulled me off the road on a curve and constantly jerks to the right even when I am directly in the middle of the lane.  I've read complaints from others that this appears to be connected to the lane sway feature of the electronics (not the lane departure feature).  The dealer says it's all in my  head, although the loaner car they gave me was like a normal car that had smooth steering and the steering wheel didn't jerk once.  I consider my car a lemon and I regret buying it -- especially when the men who sold me this expensive car keep ignoring my complaints.",neg
"Hello. My name is Steve and I recently purchased new 2018 Subaru Forester. Not long afterwards I had a very surprising discovery I would like to share with you guys. Every time you will disconnect your battery you will need to have your windows reprogrammed in order for them to function. It can be done at your Subaru dealership. I did contact Subaru of America representative to confirm everything - yes, windows need to be reprogrammed. And on top of enormous inconvenience it brings - YOU WILL HAVE TO PAY FOR IT! 
I couldn't believe it when they said it. Don't forget - you disconnect the battery not only when you exchange it for the new one. Most of the repairs start with the words: ""disconnect your battery"". I know people who during really cold nights in the winter time disconnect the battery and place it in the warm of the house to insure the car will start in the morning. 
I just wanted to warn my fellow customers who still deciding which way to go about that fact.",neg
"Subaru prominently displays, on the console screen, a picture of a car with an arrow pointing toward a gas pump. Next to this graphic is some number of miles, always a multiple of ten. I was wondering if I could trust it and wanted to trust it because it gave me plenty of miles to get to the next State of Washington gas pump which I'm supposed to use. I watched it carefully as it dropped from 50 to 40 to 30. I was about 15 miles from the State pumps when the display went from 30 miles to empty to a series of dashes. Great! Why even include this feature if it bails on the driver at that critical point when gas is running out? I immediately found a gas station and charged an expensive tank full to the State of Washington. And, I drove away with a sour feeling about what is otherwise a decent car.",neg
My wife leased a 2016 model and within 6 mths  the battery began to completely fail without any warning.  After 6 or so episodes of this the dealer replaced the car with a 2017 model.  Well guess what: after approx. 6 mths the battery completely failed again.  Do not buy/lease a Subaru Forrester unless you enjoy waking up each day wondering if your car will start!,neg
"I ordered a toyota RAV4 but got a Forrester from Alamo.  Drove the car 4 weeks.  Display drove me crazy.  Clock was advancing hilarously.  very unlogical controls.  Banged my head several times against the trunk lid.  Underpowered car.  Overtaking others is a life threathening experience.  Loads of noise but car does not move faster.  never again.  Drove a Hyundai I10 the week before in rough roads in Iceland, performed much better...",neg
"I purchased this vehicle because of Subaru's reputation for making high quality cars.  I bought a 2017 Subaru Forester last year.  I've had it less than a year and it's been in the shop more times than I can count.  I had it less than a week when the eyesight started failing. The service center said they fixed it.  Then it would happen again.  The service center would say they fixed it again.  Then it would happen again. This happened at least 4 times. And, I stopped taking it in.  Then there was a recall because the engine fluid wasn't properly filled.  Then the tire pressure monitoring system alarm went off.  I took it in. The service center said it would take an hour.  It took over two hours.  When I go the car, the alarm light was still on.  The service center assured me it would turn off after driving. Not true. I took it back into the service center. Left it there for 4 hours. They said the car was ready and they had fixed the problem. I went to pick it up and then they said it actually wasn't ready, but would be soon.  Then after waiting longer, they said actually the problem wasn't fixed and they would have to order new parts.  This is an ongoing saga.  I'd strongly advise anyone not to purchase this vehicle. It's a poor quality product and Subaru provides poor service.",neg
"My 2017 Forester XT Touring model has been one disappointment after another. The CVT transmission is just horrible, and completely detracts from owning the turbo model. When I try to accelerate quickly there is a 2 second delay before the car takes off. The manual shift mode doesn't help at all. The RPMs jump up to about 4000 and just stay there (whether I'm in the manual shift mode or not) until I ease up on the accelerator. The Harman Kardon sound system is terrible, too. The bass response is overbearing. I have to turn the bass all the way down, and it's still way too overbearing. The Harman Kardon system doesn't have speed controlled volume leveling, or several other features that are found on Subaru's basic sound system. The paint job on my Forester is terrible. The paint is so thin that it is chipped very easily. While washing the car, I have found several tiny little chips in the hood, the roof, and the doors. It seems that every time I wash the car I find new chips in the paint. I took it to the dealer to report the problem with the paint and the dealer told me to report the problem to Subaru of America (SOA). I reported the problem to SOA and they told me to take the vehicle to a dealer. The dealer says there's nothing they can do about the paint, so SOA says there's nothing they can do either. The climate control system doesn't work very well. When I'm heating up the interior, in the winter, and the desired temperature is reached, the AC comes on. The remote start is pretty worthless because the car shuts off when I open the door, so I have to re-start the vehicle (brilliant engineering). I have music stored on a USB drive, but every time I switch to the USB to listen to music it takes several minutes for the music to load. There are many other disappointments with this vehicle. Let me just say that I had a 2005 Forester XT Limited that blew this this away, as far as the overall quality was concerned, but also performance wise, too. Subaru has gone way downhill. I'll never own another one after this.",neg
"This is our 4th Subaru. Previously owned Impreza 2007, Forester 2011 and Outback 2013. I got to say, I'm extremely disappointed with 2017 Forester. Aesthetically it is very appealing and during the test drive everything appears to be great. Well after driving for 5 thousand miles and couple of smaller road trips, we realized that ride quality is very poor,  it feels like the car wobbles side to side like a carriage and because of the wobble it you constantly have to correct the wheel for it to go straight, especially at higher speeds. My 2011 Forester went dead straight and we went 2500 road trip in our 2013 Outback and it felt perfectly safe. My guess is that Subaru is trying so hard to appeal to general public with wrong tastes for so called ""softer ride"" they completely ruined what used to be an amazing line of cars. I would not recommend anyone getting Forester 2017, I wish i could take an extended drive in a car before we leased it and now we are stuck!",neg

"Purchased 2017 Forester in October of 2016 at Bob Moore Subaru in Edmond Oklahoma.  Will never go back.  RUDE.  Heated seats do not function well.  Either too hot or too cold.  Drove an Outback loaner and big difference..much better.  Drove to Denver in December of 2016 with snow and treatments on roads.  My windshield has small chips and speckles all over it.   The car grill, headlights etc  have a few very light marks...the windshield is horrible...horrible. My two other cars, an X-5 BMW and GMC Yukon, which have over 100,000 miles, their windshields have nothing like this and have had much, much, much more exposure to harsh elements.  Something is wrong with Subaru windshields!",neg
"2017 Forester 2.0 XT- I have had the radio in the the dealer  4 times because it keeps losing its satellite signal so it is constantly  losing the radio station. The dealer has changed out the radio but it  is still not working properly. It also has a problem with the power windows locking up so they wont go up or down. The USB ports are poorly located and  are hard to use.  Also I purchased the all weather floor mats from the dealer but they are too small so the mud/snow gets all over my carpeting. I had to purchase the Weather tech mats to replace the dealer mats.  The car does have too much road noise, and had a bad case of turbo lag.",neg
The CVT transmission makes for a driving experience not unlike that of a go-cart.  There is a lag on acceleration and the continuous nature of this technology makes it just dreadful to drive.  I couldn't wait for the test drive to end.,neg
"Updated 10k mile review                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Pro's 1.

Handling especially in high winds 2. Gas mileage expected it to be 26-28 and it's 24-24 highway 3.  Headlights are great but the bright lights only turn on when the ambient light is low. 4. Incredibly loud in a rain storm. 5. Resetting the clock even the dealer can't do it. 6. General ergonomics do not fit a person over 6 foot the door rest is too low and the window sill is too high. My car now has 47000 miles on it and I am still have not changed my mind the car is boring to drive, does not fit me and the technology is ridiculous you have to go to the dealership to change the time! I will be selling the car in the next 6 months.",neg
"This is my second Forester. Last one was an '03. The 2017 should fit most people's needs, but is undriveable for me. Biggest complaint is the front headrests. I am 5'10"" and the headrest pushes my head forward and down. I can't drive it for more than a few minutes without hurting myself. Blind spot at passenger side rear when looking at it from driver's seat is big, and made more so by body design: right rear window sweeps up towards tailgate, so body design gives you an idea that there's a car there when there isn't. You have to really look, not glance, to check that blind spot. I like the manual transmission, but think there should be some more spacing between the gears. I'm constantly shifting from 2nd to 5th (skipping 3rd) or 3rd to 6th (skipping 4th) because the selections are tightly spaced. As I get used to it, that should change. Cabin noise is about normal for a low-20s priced car. You're not going to get a Caddie. Fit, finish, steering, and handling,  are good for a car in its price range. Acceleration is good. Subaru has never made seats for long drives for most people, and I knew that when buying the car (my problem is the headrest, not the seat). I've had the car for 6 weeks now. Most of my driving has been city driving, so mileage is low and probably unfair at first glance.

Update for the comment that asked about adjusting the headrest: Yes, both I and the dealer tried different headrest positions; no luck. My head gets pushed forward and down. I'm going to have to spring for an interior customizer to modify the head rests. Cost unknown. Head rests in old '03 were fine.

Update on review: Nothing has changed. Gas mileage is lower than expected, but not by much, and given my driving habits and city driving, I can't complain too much about that. Headrests are miserable and it cost $150 to have one headrest modified so I could stand to drive it for more three minutes.  Blind spot at passenger side rear is large.

Don't buy it. Subaru can design a Forester with a much smaller blind spot, and headrests that don't pitch one's head forward. When Subaru does that, fine.",neg
"2017 and the first month was great..then came the rain. A puddle of water on passenger side floor. Of course we brought it back to the dealer and wanted it fixed and get things replaced and wanted to know what's going on. Well to our surprise they tell us the air conditioner is blocked and that is causing it. Well I don't know how that can cause a puddle that goes above the floor mat. What the heck how can that be it's bran new. We have owned multiple cars and none have had issue like this.  Not sure about Subaru's quality anymore...

So after much back and forth with the dealership over the phone, and many trips there as well, it all came down to a plugged drain line for the air conditioner which of course they fix and then cleaned the carpet. They gave us a nice gift and upgraded our warranty. Lets see how well the floor pan holds up over the next couple of years.",neg
"I purchased a 2017 Forrester after owning 2 VW Tiguans over 8 years, I needed more space and better fuel economy and that's what I got. The vehicle has great space and much better MPH than either of my VW's. l love the headlights ( except the brights only will turn on when the car allows it). I really like the self dimming mirrors. I cant figure out how to remote start the vehicle and my salesman finally gave up because he didn't know either. Interior trim is not durable I am a hockey player and it's definitely not going to hold up. The drivers seat and controls are not ergonomically set up, after 2500  miles i still cant get the seat right. The car is suppose to have better handling and corning than the VW, I disagree it feels clumsy in the corners and almost feels top heavy. In high winds the car gets pushed off the road. Visibility is awesome in this car no doubt. The technology is overwhelming between satellite radio,  all the drivers training tools and eyesight you will spend hours in the owners manual. I am sorry I bought this car.
Updated now with 25K miles
I figured out the headlights and the remote start but overall the car is still not for me. To much technology; when you have to go to the dealership to change the clock that's ridiculous. Overall my impression of the car and the brand remains mediocre and I will be shopping for a new car as soon as I can afford it.",neg
Dear 2017 Forester owners. I desperately need a feedback. I bought this brand new Forester with all the bells and whistles. Like any new car it had an upholstery smell which generally goes away with time but not in this car. I have been driving this car now for almost 2 months. My whole body would smell like old leather or shoe polish including from my breath. I always owned a new car but never a Subaru. This smell turned into headaches and lightheadedness and watery eyes when I turned my Heater on few days back. To experiment whether it is me only I told my wife to test drive with my son. Just 30 minutes into driving she started getting headaches and watery eyes. She had to stop the car and tell my son to go on the back seat to avoid a/c due to he getting nauseated. I took the car to dealer who found nothing wrong and referred me to Subaru tech team and I am still waiting to hear from them. I have kept my windows open but no improvements. I am so scared to drive because of headaches and drowsiness kicking in. Can someone please let me know if they are going through the same. One article I read showed in 2007 study that Forester was one of the 10 worst car for toxic fume in the cabin. I don't think since 2007 they have done any improvement in the quality of material they are using. Surprisingly only  Forester was mentioned and no other Subaru models were mentioned. I felt so bad that I leased this vehicle. If they don't take back I don't know what my options are. Please any advice is highly appreciated. Jay,neg
"We bought the car based on all the hype of being one of the best for quality ... loved it ... then one month later and week of light rain and pool of water higher than floor mat on the passenger side. Of course now the worry is what other issues down the road will this cause..smell, rusting who knows..",neg
"I had it 5 days & brought it back to the dealer as brakes were squealing & my husband noted the front passenger brake was hot. I was told by dealer mechanic I should have not just stopped by, but should have called to make an appt.   I had the car 5 days!!! Car just didn't feel right. Told there was no problem. Then the following week, 5 or 6 days later the check engine light came on & I called for appt. Told me bring it right down. Told there is a problem with O2 sensor software & Subaru has no fix for it yet...that they're working on it. I could feel a lack of power when that engine light came on, but am told that the car is ok & that I should bring it back to have the engine light reset if it comes back on again & that they'll call me when Subaru has a software fix. Brakes still make noise & the engine still feels like it gets a slight ""buck"" or ""bounce"" in it. I feel I was sold a product by Subaru when they knew there was a problem with it. Mechanic told me they had another 2017 Forester will the O2 sensor issue as well. I told them I wanted Subaru to take this car back.  I was told the dealer manager would call me & he never did. I'm afraid to take this car any long distance. I bought it brand new based on reliability reviews. I bought a new car because I didn't want problems with a used one. Should have bought something else! I will never buy another Subaru.  I sure miss my 2011 Nissan Xterra Pro 4x! I gave it to my son & NEVER had a problem with it.",neg
"Went and bought my wife a brand new 2017 Forester Touring the other day. Picked up the car to bring it home and got 12 miles down the road only to see white smoke pouring out the tailpipe! Pulled it over and called the dealer. They sent a tow truck that took over an hour to get to us. It was close to 100 degrees outside and we had our 10 month old baby in the backseat. It got so hot I had no other choice but to start the car to keep my daughter cool. Dealer said they would fix the car. NO WAY, I want a new car! Subaru is trying to just fix the car......lol. Luckily my wife's cousin is a consumer lawyer. Has already received word that Subaru will write me a check for the car I paid cash for and cover his expenses. Unfortunately, after how we were treated by the dealer and Subaru, we will never buy a vehicle from them again!",neg
"After Purchasing and owning  several new GM and Toyota Vehicles, we decided to try  a Subaru.  This might date me, but these things were all the rage, back in the early 80's, and I was feeling nostalgic.   We read all the reviews, drank the cool-aid and said, we want to feel that ""love and loyalty"" Subaru owners seem to have.  We were wrong.  After owning this car for two years and 35,000 miles later we will never buy another Subaru.   There are plenty of better cars out there for the money.   Their ""after the purchase"" support is not great.   I quite honestly had never driven a worst car on winter roads than this Forester.   I have driven in Mich winters for 35 years and have never been in  car that has handled this badly, or have ever heard the wind noise this thing makes.  They told me it was the tires.   They told me unfortunately other people have had the same problem.  People say to me hey how do you like your Subaru, I tell them the truth, I guess we just never felt the ""Love""",neg
"The Subaru Forester my wife and I own is a 2016 2.5i Premium. Overall, very nice vehicle, but if you are considering one, you might want to consider my impressions of the vehicle after putting 32,000 miles on what was a dealer loaner with 5,000 miles on it at delivery. The Good: 1) Great gas mileage, average is 28 locally, 30 on a trip to New York State from Alabama. 2) AWD nice, even in Alabama since we attend events (flea markets, festivals) that require parking in fields. 3) Ground clearance very nice, never scraped anything (curb, steep driveway). 4) Vehicle has a low center of gravity compared to other compact SUVs so it holds the road on curves (probably due to flat Boxer engine).  The Bad: 1) Red dashboard lights are annoying and everywhere (on the doors and console too). 2) Squeak/rattle at highway speeds in dashboard when temperature goes into 30s that gets worse as the temperature drops – goes away starting in 40s and up (dealer uncertain as to fix). 3) No parts made in the United States, so much for supporting local industry. 4) Cabin noise creates a problem for someone in the back seat who is expected to participate in conversations between people sitting in front seats.  The Ugly: 1) Front seats very comfortable for wife, very uncomfortable for daughter. 2) While safety tests put the vehicle near the top of compact SUVs, the Death Rate in the vehicle (IIHS) is about at the national average for vehicles. 3) Fold-down rear split seats allow hauling, but the seats do not fold completely flat – there is a troublesome bump that can damage items (loog IKEA boxes). 4) Uses regular gasoline, but requires full-synthetic engine oil. 5) Although engine has lots of room to maneuver for servicing, dealer says some quick-lubes have confused the oil and transmission drain plugs and caused major transmission problems that require a prolonged fight to get reimbursed for damage. Overall, so far a good vehicle, and I would consider buying another. Wife is thrilled with the vehicle and says it is the first vehicle she has made payments on that she is happy about making the payment. So you know what our next vehicle is likely to be – that is how we stayed married for 38 years.",neg
"Bought this car for my wife, mostly because it had sweet safety ratings and distracted driver assistance. Rides quiet and fine. Looks okay, but could be a little more stylish. Safety seems excellent. Love the Eyesight, which prevented me from rolling into a car which inexplicably stopped in front of me. The first disappointment was the mileage, which was significantly lower than the sticker estimate (24/32), and one reason I chose this vehicle over other options. Suburb/highway combined mileage netted just under 24, whereas highway never topped 26. Interior was the major disappointment here, and mostly on things you wouldn't know without using the SUV for a while. The fabric on the ceiling is pretty flimsy, easily soiled and hard to clean. But the worst is the super-thin plastic interior of the cargo area. We placed some suitcases back there for a trip to the beach, and it busted a hole in the plastic wall surrounding the compartment. On closer inspection, I could see how ridiculously-thin the material was. Guessing this was used either for weight/mileage, or cost, but it could be described as an interior crumple zone, because the next hard object that goes in there will likely bust another hole in it. Can't imagine someone using this vehicle to move any sort of equipment or even making a trip to the hardware store. Seriously cheap. If they haven't upgraded the cargo interior and ceiling fabric in later models, I'd look at other manufacturers, who now have similar driver's assistance systems available. Oh, and the manager never called my wife back when she wanted to talk about the interior damage, so won't be going back there (Herb Gordon, MD).",neg
"If you enjoy a vehicle that rides like a buckboard, seats that extremely uncomfortable, has poor instrumentation, a unbelievably subpar stereo system then this is the vehicle for you. I could kick myself a  hundred times for not buying a Ford Edge.
  When I wrote the above lines we had 17,000 miles on the vehicle. Now we have 25,000 on it. My opinion of the vehicle hasn't changed. We were almost in a very bad crash. The vehicle handled superbly and we avoided the crash, but would still not consider buying another one.",neg
"The paint quality is is terrible. The paint is chipping off like I've never seen before. Every time I wash the vehicle I find new chips in the paint. Subaru says they can't do anything about it. I've never had this issue before, and I've been driving for almost forty years.",neg
"We've always owned Honda...for the majority of our marriage.  The Subaru was a new purchase, we don't lease, now that we are done with totting kids around and don't need the Mother van.  I've found most features disappointing or annoying on the 2016 Forester. The Accelerator pedal is so small, it makes my 5'2""frame tired after driving 45 minutes.   The carpet is so cheap, the blonde hair in our family makes the black carpet look forever dirty.  The ""fuel release"" lever is on the floor vs. the vertical floor board near the break pedal, so it's always dirty.  I hate the ""LURCH'  in the accelerator.   I hate the beeping of the seat belt warning @ 3 miles an hour, so you can't move your car from one spot in your garage to another with buckling up.  I hate the change box, you can't plug in your phone with spilling the change.  I hate there's no place for a woman's purse...and if you throw it onto the passengers seat, you have to ""buckle it in"" because 3-5 pounds sets off the alarm to buckle.  I regret NOT BUYING a HONDA even though I got the Subaru because I did not want all the silly bells and whistles the CR-V offered.",neg
Stiff and awkward.  poor visibility out back sides.  small cargo area.,neg
"Not only was I taken on the lease, I am shocked how cheaply this car made compared to previous 2006 Forester i owned. The interior is all cheap hard plastic, the car sides bend with pressure of one finger, like a cheap car i had in 1990’s not like previous Subaru. This one already has bad scratch on back because rear has no real bumper but cheap plastic, last one had hard rubber there which showed nothing after hitting garbage can. I got it with all the expensive “safety’ features, but it lacks the most important one, blind spot monitoring.  Over all paid fortune, cheated by dealer, and wound up with car that  exemplifies cliche of lipstick on pig",neg
"This 2015 Subaru Forester was my first new vehicle in 12 years. I did my research and test drove a lot of other vehicles before choosing it. Everything was fine until the oil light came on before the first scheduled service. I checked the oil and it was a quart down. I put a quart of oil in and mentioned it when I took the car in for service. The maintenance person I spoke to was completely mystified as to what could be wrong. I have had the car a little over a year and a half and have had to put oil in it three times. The dealership has had me coming back every 1200 miles to do oil consumption test ""to see what could be wrong"". Three weeks ago I got a settlement notice of a class action suit against Subaru for excessive oil consumption in the 2014 and 2015 Foresters. So, all along the service people must have known what was happening and I can only assume that they were told to lie about it. I like the car, it's fun to drive, but I really resent being treated like an idiot by the dealership I will never buy another Subaru. In my opinion they are completely unreliable.
Update as of June 2017:  The dealership replaced the engine in my Forester in September of 2016 after I sent in a very negative survey to Subaru corporate. It came out that the design of the engine I had allowed synthetic oil to leak around the seals, thus explaining the low oil levels. Since replacing the engine is an expensive fix, that is why the dealership didn't want to admit there was a problem. Since the engine was replaced the car has been burning oil normally and I've gotten to a place where I think I can stand to keep the car. I will not, however, ever buy another Subaru. Trust lost often can never be earned back.",neg
"The new Subaru Forester is not an improvement over previous year models.  I had this as a courtesy car for 3 days, so it went on my 45 mile each way work commute which takes me across small neighborhood roads as well as the majors and the turnpike, so all kinds of driving.  I noticed right away that the interior has some line of sight problems. The side windows are junked up with fake little triangle windows  near the front corners, so that the reflection of the interior is plainly visible in the window when  you are trying to look at the side rear view mirrors.  When trying to adjust the rear view mirror to see out the back and sides of the vehicle I accidently hit the on-star emergency button and was promptly given a call.  These small 911 butons turned out to be right above where I put my hand to bring the RW mirror to my height, so rotating the mirror down brought my knuckles into contact witthe call buttons.  Behind me, in the way of seeing to traffic, were the seat belt line from the back cargo area to the center back seat, and all 3 headrests also blocked my view.  The back of the car supplies large corner blind spots so that there is no adjustment that lets you see cars coming from behind you right or left.  I never achieved a position that alieviated the sight problems, and could not find the knob to adjust the outside view mirrors.
The seats are made of a shiny cover material so I was unsteady and  sliding off them, these are ""cloth"" seats, I think, that also had a heated feature with controls front and down on the center console.  The seats are supposed to be buckets, but are so uncomfortable, stiff and slippery that it was more like a personal bench seat.  The dials and knobs on the radio and heat are cheap shiny silver plastic that really feel and look rather low class.  The dashboard is still the sticky soft fake leather that I had in my 2008 Outback and already sported a layer of fuzz and dust that I know from experience cannot be removed. The feel of the ride, compared to my old Outback that needs struts, was just as bouncy and all over the road as my 08, so maybe I don't need that strut job afterall. 
               The Forester has LOTS of headroom, and a moonroof, but the front dash seemed all wrong, nothing was near enough for me to be able to use it easily or without stretching and craning.  Acceleration was awful in that it jerked around, although I am willing to say that maybe that was me not being able to find a comfortable seating position.  In slow and go traffic I had trouble keeping it completely  straight on, and there was a little audio buzzer on the dash to  tell me each time I strayed close to my lane line and yet nothing to tell me when other people were coming into my lane.  Climate controls were hard to figure out -- remember this coming from an Outback owner.  Maybe a larger person than myself would appreciate the shape of this car, but for someone 5 feet 5""  this car was too big and uncomfortable.  When it comes time to replace my 08 Outback I will be looking at something that does not put me in a 4 wheel skyscraper.  I thought it was good on gas, maybe because it has a larger tank than my Outback. But it would also be too tall for me to load my kayak as I am used to doing.",neg
"I've owned a 2015 Subaru CVT for one year and have put 10K miles on it around Denver, Colorado.  I am extremely disappointed, and look forward to replacing it soon with a real car.

I chose the Subaru Forester for very practical reasons:  Great visibility, reliability, road clearance for the occasional offroading, and all-wheel traction in the winter.  These elements, however, do not offset the downsides.  

1.  Most annoying has been the constant rattling of the vent and speaker grills on the dashboard.  Turns out that this problem is well documented on the Internet, yet the dealer acted surprised when I brought it in for repair.  Twice now they have failed to fix the noise, and I have an appointment to take it back a third time.
2.  The CVT, in combination with the slow-to-warm-up Boxer engine, is so bad at accelerating that you must pro-actively plan your route to avoid the need for quick speed.  For instance, until the engine is warm, I have to leave extremely large spaces when going from my residential area to merge onto a two-lane thoroughfare.  And it takes the engine 10 minutes, or 2 miles to warm up (when the blue light goes off).   So don't plan to jump on the freeway and hope to accelerate to match the speed of traffic - ain't gonna happen.  Worse, the CVT is quirky, and not in a good way.  Sometimes a touch of the accelerator causes it to lerch forward.  Other times, it won't move.  I HATE HATE HATE the CVT.
3.  In the center of the dash is an information screen that shows your average mpg.  This number -- usually around 26 mpg -- is 2 and 3 miles greater than what I'm actually getting (calculated by miles driven since last refueling).  I'm beginning to wonder if they have programmed the onboard computer to deliberately do this - ala Volkswagon misrepresenting diesel emissions.
4.  The ride can be kidney-jarringly bad.  There is a stretch of I-25 through south Denver where the combination of road surfacing, the car's short track, and traveling at normal freeway speeds will cause the car to continuously shudder in a very uncomfortable manner.   (This happens with the factory installed tires inflated at proper psi).
5.  The wheel-wells are unacceptably tight for an SUV designed for winter travel.  Shortly after I bought the car in Winter 2015, I smelled burning rubber while driving on a snow covered road.  I was the only car on the road, so I knew it was my Subaru.  Upon pulling over and inspecting the car, I discovered that the snow accumulation  of 2-3"" in the back wheel-well was rubbing the back tires and causing the smell.  Now when it snows, I have to be constantly vigilant that this doesn't happen.  I can see how an engineer designed the very tight wheel-wells to reduce wind drag and improve gas mileage, but in so doing, they have seriously impaired the car's ability to travel safely in the snow.

Before purchasing the Subaru Forester, I did extensive research via Edmunds and Consumer Reports.  Both love the Subarus and failed to mention the problems I'm experiencing.  Not only am I disappointed with the Subaru, but I am also profoundly perplexed that after all my research, test drives, and talking to people, I made this expensive mistake.",neg
"2016 forester with 300 miles. the gas paddel   has to much delay. sometime you have to push it 3 times to get it to take the fuel, has pulled me into the traffic several times and then nothing, leaves you hanging there, started before the first 100 miles,  only has 300 miles on it now,  has been in the shop 3 times, they keep saying it is ok,  i guess they think i am dreaming, wish i had my old 1996 van back and my money out of this junk, don't buy one of these.  PS loves its gas, about 15 miles to a gal.",neg
If wanting remote start. Don't purchase a Touring model. Due to Keyless Access the remote start has a 30 ft range. Very old technology.  The other non Keyless Access models have a 400 ft range. I have reached out to Subaru of America and they states receiving numerous complaints about remote start. But did not have a fix for the issue.,neg
"Had the vehicle less than 3 months. It has been in the shop on 3 occasions two of which were multiple days. The main problem is the quality of the interior. There are multiple rattles throughout the vehicle. The two main rattles still haven't been fixed. 
The engine is under powered. No acceleration at all. Road noise is bad. Ride is rough.
Update. Got rid of the vehicle.",neg
Very noisy inside and out( engine too). Too expensive on maintenance every time you go to service have to pay for something extra. The interior is easy to get dirty and hard to clean. Should get a CRV or A Rav4 never again a forester. After we paid it up we’ll trade it its not worth keeping it,neg
I loved this car at first - it met all of my needs. But then guess what? Repair bills constantly for every little thing. Should have gotten a Rav4 or CRV!,neg
"Bought brand new. Has be in and out of dealer all the time. Will not but a Subaru again. Would have considered it IF Subaru stood begins their product, they did not. I just got a lemon and I’ve been stuck with it for 60,000 miles.",neg
"Started using oil at around 50000:( Has anyone had issues with rear tires wearing prematurely?? 75000 mile tires only last 30000 miles. The alignment is fine. Owned a 92 Legacy, best car I ever owned. Thought Subaru was the best, guess I was wrong!!",neg
"Year 1: Entire dashboard lights up with warning lights everywhere; stuck in the “I” fuel efficient driving mode. Dealership tells me I am not tightening fuel cap tight enough. This happens THREE times before they detect 2 faulty fuel sensors and replace them. Also, Bluetooth and audio system fail intermittently. Year2: After  Bluetooth system completely  crashes, I am told I am not pairing i-phone correctly and to bring it in and they will do it for me. Once they discover that indeed it is not user error but in fact the system HAS crashed, they reset the software to fix it. Continues to fail off and on. Year 3: Head unit/Bluetooth completely crashes again, they replace the head unit with supposedly updated unit. New unit crashes within 2 weeks. Am now waiting to get this unit replaced so I can dump this nightmare for another not-Subaru vehicle. One last comment: car’s display shows around 25-27 mpg when actual calculations show mpg to be around 22-23. Am told there is no way to re-calibrate this mpg display.",neg
"The Subaru Forester is a great car - gets great gas mileage, good acceleration, and lots of cargo space.  BUT it has very unsafe handling capacity on windy days.  Even mild gusts of wind pull and push this car all over the road.  One particularly windy day, I was white knuckling the drive home down I95 - the car is so light that it took all my effort to control the steering wheel and not get blown into the other lane!  I've also had terrible problems with the Bluetooth.  Very poor sound quality during phone calls.  And each time I got a new cell phone, the Bluetooth would stop automatically connecting to the phone once I paired the new phone with the Bluetooth device.  I got so frustrated with the unsafe driving conditions on windy days and the malfunctioning Bluetooth that I used the car as a trade in and got a new Rav4.  Fortunately the Forester holds its resale value and I got a good price on my trade-in!",neg
"This is my first and last Subaru.  I have a 2015 Forester.  Bought it for the turbo.  Accelleration is great, but the touring suspension is firm, leading to a lousy ride.  Bluetooth rarely works the way it should - drops calls all the time.  Interior quality is terrible.  Vinyl on driver's seat is cracking.  Dealer blamed me - said it was a sharp object in my pocket.  It's a four inch rip - looks like a 20 year old car.  Brakes are terrible.  I hit them at high speeds and the rumble and shake.  Dealer said they were working fine.  It has been reliable, but the quality just isn't there.  Seat belts with child car /booster seats are hard to fasten - so much for kid friendly cars.  Maybe dogs are happier in Subarus.  Paint is thin and the steel dents easily.  Subaru dealers think they have good customer service, but they really don't.  I've waited three hours for an oil change (and that's with an appointment).  I'll be going back to driving Chevys again.",neg
Bought our Forester in Nov. of 15.  Our biggest complaint is the very uncomfortable seats.  They are very hard and lack any amount of comfort.  Long trips are nearly impossible with this car.  The electronics are very confusing and difficult to figure out.  We have never been able to get the garage door to sync with the car and the phone to work hands free.  It has been reliable and is easy to get in and out of.  Visibility is pretty good.,neg
"My car runs out of oil between oil changes. The dealer did an oil consumption test and told me I should be checking oil like they did in the old days, when pumping gas at each fill up.  I run synthetic oil so I go between 6,000-7,000 miles between changes. Twice I have run out of oil after 5,000 miles.  The first time I thought it was an error during the oil change. The next time I knew it was the car. The good news is I don't have to dispose of used oil... there isn't any. My husband drives a Chevy truck with over 100,000 miles and has never had to add oil. My boss bought two Kia's and they both have over 100,000 miles, no issues.  My car has had break issues at 60,000 miles, front and back washer pumps replaced. Front axle replaced. Seat belt recall. Timing belt cover had a hole in it, had to pull engine. Now it drinks oil ... a lot. All of this before 100,000 miles. I have owned Subaru's for over 30 years. This will be my last.",neg
"My problem started in May 2015 with approximately 30000 on the car. The car didn't want to accelerate when first starting. When stepping on the gas the vehicle lurched forward. I took it in to Subaru three times and they told me this was normal with their CVT transmissions. Finally at about 40000 I took it in a fourth time and I'm told I have a failed transmission. this was based on anise they heard coming from the engine. Subarus exact words and what is written on my diagnosis. I'm no mechanic but that makes no sense to me. They gave me an estimate of approximately $9,000 to repair. The vehicle has a 60k power train warranty. You would think Subaru would replace it under warranty. Nope. They are trying to not honor my warranty and stick me with the bill. I have had nothing but problems with this vehicle and with Subaru customer service. I told Subaru I didn't feel safe driving this vehicle with my three year old child. Subaru offered to reimburse my $30 per day for 5 days of s rental vehicle. My five days are up and I have yet to receive any response from Subaru Corp. Unacceptable Subaru!",neg
"I have put about 14,000 miles on the car and it drives great and handles well.  The mileage is quite good with about 27 mpg average but on the highway it can get nearly 40 mpg if you keep your speed down.  Engine power could be described as adequate but not really sufficient for mountain driving with most grades requiring down shifting into 4th gear.  Interior room is good and the sunroof is nice but noisy over 55 mph.  I am 6'1"" and the drivers seat does not fit me all that well but my wife loves it.  The rear seat room is much improved over older models and head room is quite good as well.  I would rate the fit and finish as very good, the doors close with precision and a light touch and wind and road noise are low. The sheet metal is very thin and acorns will put dents in the hood so be careful where you park. The 6 speed manual transmission is nice as long as you don't try fast shifts as it will balk or go into the wrong gear.  One thing some drivers may not like is the lurid red instrument lighting.  Red is good as it does not impact your night vision like blue does but it is jarring.

Now the bad and it is really bad.   Major oil consumption issues from new ending up with a quart every 900 miles or so after 5,000 miles.  Subaru did put a new short block in it but the new engine already has been removed to replace a bad rear main oil seal which was leaking all  over my garage floor.  Once that was done it still leaks oil and now the engine pings badly.  The dealer has been unable to find and correct the oil leak.

Update - The dealer in Fresno destroyed my second engine by putting way too much gasket sealant on gaskets which blocked oil flow and DESTROYED the engine.  Subaru of America finally had another dealer install a new engine which has been good so far (about 10k on this engine).

 After THREE engines in 9 months we seem to finally have an engine that runs properly and does not use too much oil.  The latest engine does use a quart or so between changes but I guess I will have to live with it. 

Be forewarned about the oil consumption issue and be wary of certain Subaru dealers in Fresno, Ca!

Update - Complete AC system failure!  The compressor, hoses, evaporator and all the O-rings in the system were leaking.  Fortunately the extended warranty paid for it all but it meant two trips to the dealer to find all the problems.  One other small thing - the cargo light in the rear is a joke. So dim it is useless and it is low down where cargo blocks it anyway.

Update - Can't wait to unload this car. Nothing new has gone wrong since the AC system crapped out.",neg
"not safe: intermittent temporary loss of power up to 4 sec.

"We had a 2014 Forester, after about a year wanted to get some upgrades.  After some looking we decided to stay with the forester and get a 2015.  Now after only 13k miles and 8 times in the dealer tech has come to this conclusion on 2 issues.  Issue 1. Our ac fan will not stay on high for more than a couple mins. They have said the car is not designed to have the fan on high for min than a couple mins.  From there on it will cycle from high to about every 2 seconds. Really!!   It gets better. Issue #2.  When you step on the gas the car will not go over 15 or 20 mph for about a quarter to half mile.  I am told that I should not expect the car accelerate continuously.  Due to the cvt I should let my foot off the gas for about 10 seconds then try to accelerate again.  I have nearly been in 4 accidents, I am going guess in the near future there are going to a lot more problems. And of course the bucking and rough idle normal too.  This car is junk.  Do not buy it.",neg
Traded this vehicle 11 months after purchase.  It was not a quality vehicle.,neg
"I was so excited about a new, super safe, fun to drive forester. My forester is all of those things, except I have had it in the shop 7 times in the year and a half I've owned it. Problems with the Hill Start Assist System, and even worse the Eye Sight. Dealer replaced the camera and computer to fix the eye sight, after too many attempt to repair. But as of tonight the 'Check Hill Start Assist' warning displayed for no reason.
So disappointed, car is fun and safe, but I don't feel it is reliable. Worst of all Subaru of America has been sympathetic but has made not real attempt to maintain good customer service or step and and do the right thing and replace the vehicle. ",neg
"As an owner of a 2015 Subaru Forester Touring model, I will NOT recommend Subaru to anyone as long as they do NOT support their interior safety and electronics. After having the head unit/Infotainment unit replaced on 4/3/15, constant issue of the head unit's Bluetooth constantly disconnecting on the Samsung S5, iPhone 6, and Samsung S6 Edge. During the pickup of my vehicle on 4/3/15, the service tech felt he needed to advise me that Subaru does NOT support the latest device, the Samsung S6  or S6 Edge despite the fact it's the same bluetooth profiles in this device as previous Samsung models that are supported on their website.

"I did the research and all I all saw by the major review sites was excellent. Purchased the 2015 Forester and liked it originally. Then I took a trip from Detroit to Chicago, the roads were icy but traffic was moving at 60-70 mile per hour clip along the freeway. The Foresters rear end would slip side to side at 35-40 mph. this contiued to happenfor the next hour as i drove with my hazards on.( Yes, I was that guy!)Finally due to safety concerns, losing my rear wheels next to speeding semi's, I drove side roads the remaining 100 miles to Chicago.I spoke with service Mgr. she said Subaru called and asked if she had heard any complaints concerning this same problem. So they are aware.",neg
"I have lived in wyoming-nebraska all my life and driven on snow packed-icy roads with many different cars...rear wheel, four wheel drive cars as well as pickups.  The Subaru forester is the worst vehicle I have ever driven in my life on ice.  You have absolutely no control-it feels like you are floating all over the road and if you go anything over thirty mph.....you are totally out of control.
Shame on you Subaru for claiming to share the love....this car will end up killing people who trusted your company for designing safe cars!",neg
"This is what I don't like inside my Subaru Forester 2015. I have it 2weeks . The two vanity mirrors has no lights.

When sun comes in you can't see out.Car locks don't lock by themselves you have to lock doors. 
Glove box has no light.when you get eyesight it takes away the eye glass holder.screens are to small. Back up camera should beep. More to follow next week.Good luck if you buy this car.",neg
After driving this car for almost 60K miles I have to say I won't buy another Subaru. The CVT transmission makes driving this car dangerous. Acceleration from a stop begins with a lerch of speed and then hesitants leaving you in a pause in front of oncoming traffic. The car is now burning oil like a jalopy. The brakes seized up and failed completely. Luckily repaired under the warranty.,neg
"Carefully  check dash for deform/bubble on top of dash just to the drivers side of clock. Dealer and Toyota both acknowledged the problem but Toyota claims it won't cover under warranty because others have the same issue. So because Toyota allowed these Highlander's with a dash deform to leave the factory, it's not their problem. Our doors won't lock by touching the door handles. Wind noise is terrible and inside of doors get covered with road dust and dirt due to poor design. We have also had the front bumper pull apart from the fender to where you can see the clips. Manuals are terrible and they are just thrown in glove compartment, no organizer or binder. Long time Toyota owner. No more, they are now crap. They might as well not offer warranty, they go out of their way to avoid to ignore it.",neg

"My NEW Toyota Highlander broke down on I95 in heavy traffic at night PRIOR to it's 5000 mile check.  I was unable to get fully into the breakdown lane and was trapped in my car for 30 minutes prior to tow truck arriving. I was without my ""new"" car for a month.  After many days and nights of stress dealing with Toyota (Corporate and Westport dealership) the problem was diagnosed as needing a new transmission.  The transmission was ""lost"" during shipping - the entire process has been awful. A new transmission had to be put into my ""new"" car.  I do not feel safe in this car which obviously was a lemon.  I want a new car and I am disgusted with how I have been treated as a customer who purchased TWO new cars in 2017.  Every day I regret my decision to purchase Toyota vehicles.",neg
"We purchased a new 2017 Highlander XLE after comparing it to several other vehicles in it's class. Toyota touts quality and safety features as their biggest sales pitch, seems it's there every time we turn on a tv. The transmission problem occurred at 8,253 miles, lucky for my wife, she was at a red light when the transmission failed and nobody was injured. The vehicle was hauled to local Toyota dealer on a flatbed & sat at the dealership for 52 days. We were told by dealer that a ""new"" transmission was back-ordered from California. After picking up the vehicle I noticed the workorder stated: ""part number 30510-48600-84 REMAN ATM and CORE RETURN"". Remanufactured parts should not be used to repair a brand new vehicle under factory warranty, which hasn't seen it's first oil change. The day after picking it up I drove the vehicle and very excessive power train noise was present. Vehicle went back the the shop & they replaced both front wheel bearings at 8,392 miles and it sat in the shop another 3 days. Neither one of these repairs should occur on any new vehicle or a vehicle under 100,000 for that matter. Toyota Corporate has been less than helpful & we're currently going through the lemon law process. Toyota has lost another long time customer, if I could rate the 2017 Highlander 0 stars I would.",neg
"Leased 2nd in May 2017, I wish I could keep 2014 XLE which was much better car with very minor issues. New 8 speed transmission is very slow, jerky and non responsive, GDI engine doesn’t help to get better mileage than the old one. The start- stop feature does effect nothing about efficiency, probably will create a mechanical issues. There is no improvement in driving experience; it is still comfortable but steering doesn’t give any feedback, suspension makes much more noise than previous one. There is no update on the Entune system, it looks and works like designed by amateur software team. Also material quality is far behind the new generation SUVs. 
There are still some good things about the car; good size, roomy interior, good snow traction, exterior design is better than other Toyotas, standard safety features works fine.
Competition is getting hard in this segment, Toyota needs better chassis, transmission, electronics and material quality in and out. I had 4 Toyotas, this would be the last, the new Camry doesn’t give any hope for the new Highlander that always shares the same platform.

"My wife wanted leather seats so we purchased the XLE model, which comes with electronic and computerized everything.  Although we paid for it, we will never use nor did we want 80% of the electronic wizardry that comes in this model.  Lots of computerized stuff equates to lots of opportunity for malfunctions.  The radio is ""speed-activated,"" meaning the volume is supposed to increase gradually as the vehicle speed increases to compensate for road noise .  The radio in our highlander is defective.  The volume erratically and abruptly increases and decreases at any speed, even while the vehicle is idling.  It's enough to drive you nuts.  The vehicle is under warranty so I told the dealership I wanted the system replaced in one visit.  In response, I got a lot of rigmarole about protocol and was told the system would need to be removed and sent off for diagnosis.  I told them this was unacceptable as it meant several 100-mile round trips to the dealership.  To no avail.  They arranged a Saturday morning appointment but then told us they would need authorization to replace the system and since Toyota's technical service office is not open on a weekend, they could not get the approval.  The technician downloaded a software service pack that did not correct the problem.  I called the Toyota ""customer care"" center to lodge my complaint and insist that the problem be corrected in one additional visit.  It was like talking to a trained puppet.  More rigmarole about protocol and ""I'm sorry you are being inconvenienced"" and ""I am unable to guarantee the problem will be fixed on your next visit.""  Protocol before customer service, always !!  The vehicle also comes with ""radar activated"" cruise control.  Although functioning properly in our vehicle, it's the most worthless, vexing thing I've ever encountered.  Who wants a cruise system that slows the vehicle as it approaches another vehicle you intend to pass?  Consequently, I have to manually turn off the radar system every time I use the cruise control.  This is another example of just too much technology that's poorly thought out.",neg
"This highlander has start stop tech. Which absolutely sucks. The engine tries to stop running before the car comes to a stop. It hesitates on start up. The advertising misrepresents this feature. It is not safe. It does not save gas. Its a joke on the american public. The consumer should be able to turn this off permanently. I had a 2014 highlander which was a very good vehicle, however, i have told folks to stay away from the 2017 because of the start stop crap.",neg
"The things that am disappointed in with the ""Toyota Highlander are:     (1) Getting in and out of the car is very difficult as I am constantly hitting my head when entering the car.   (2) Wind noise is very high especially on the passenger side and my dealer says nothing can be done to help.  (3) The seat belt alarm is VERY irritating and loud.  (a warning is fine but constant loud noise makes me dislike this car).   (4) The car is very hard to program and much too hard for me to even begin to explore the options available.    (5) I cannot find any way to have more than one cell phone connected at a time, so I am unable to have both my phone and my wife's phone connected (one or the other at a time).   (6) The feature that shuts down the engine while at a stop light is very agitating and should be a option to either always on or always off.  Lastly I would like to comment on the dealership.  I was very disappointed in the dealer in my city as I felt like I was being forced into buying things I did not want to buy and almost (should have) walked out during the finance meeting.   Over all, because of the road and wind noise, along with the difficulty getting in and out of the car, I would not recommend this car.",neg
"The 2017 Highlander is advertising as 20/26 MPG, so far I only get 18 MPG! And I drive mostly on Highway! This is totally fraud advertisement. My 2014 Acura MDX has 22 MPG at least. And the Acceleration of the 2017 Highlander is just painful. Overall it's just an average car, and it's not worth if you pay over 40K! I'm so regret that I didn't add 5K-7K more to upgrade to an Acura MDX, Lexus RX, or Infinite QX60.",neg
First the windows sound that looks like a air leak. The engine and transmission sound awful for a new car. You can hear all the noise as the vehicle change gears. My dashboard lights go intermittent from time to time. The breaks cry noisy . When you are in cruise control the vehicle calculates the front vehicle speed and slow you down. If the front vehicle change line the Toyota accelerates suddenly but if the front vehicle was close to another the speed safety control delay too much to kick in again making the vehicle unsafe. The 4cyl are a lot different from the 6 cyl. They looks the same but they are not.I can reflect more problems but at this point i feel sorry for myself to buy this peace of bran new jub k..,neg
I purchased the 17 Highlander xle for my wife and the dealer has had the vehicle and put more miles on it than we have .  It had a vibration and noise coming from the front end when making left turns . I was called into the dealer 3 different times to recreate the noise for them .  The part they said was no good had to be ordered from Japan and they couldn't give me an eta .  22 days later still no word .   I would wait until they get parts issues handled before you purchase this car .  Interior quality is great but I wouldn't know because I had the car for 5 days before I took it back,neg
"Our new Toyota Highlander with the XLE package has been in the shop even before we received our license plates!  We did have 5 1/2 weeks of ""new car happiness"".  Then, while out of town, the tailgate would no longer close (automatically or manually).  Then the automatic open/close completely ceased working as well.  It is designed so you can manually move the tailgate up and down, but with the latch in locked position and refusing to open, we could no longer secure the door closed.  I removed the access panel for the latch and tried to open it, unsuccessfully  After calling and speaking with service departments at two dealerships and to a Toyota phone rep, we were still unable to resolve closing the tailgate.  In fairness, the service departments did several steps of troubleshooting with me over the phone.  But to no avail, - during our 140 mile trip back home, I secured the tailgate with a rope connected to the locked latch.  I visited the dealership after returning home.  They said the latch has malfunctioned. They also could not open it.  The electronics for the auto opening & closing tailgate and the struts (lifters) may also need replacing. They ordered a new latch and said they would replace one thing at a time and troubleshoot until resolved. No time estimate was given since they couldn't tell how many components would need replacing.  I asked about a loaner vehicle, while the work was to be done.  The dealership said that they don't have loaners, but they do have rentals.  They said they were unwilling to ""loan"" me a rental, because they'd have to bill Toyota for the rental fee.  How's that for taking care of your customers!!",neg
"OK so im in the market for an suv with 6-7 seat i saw that the new highlander came out and decided to test drive, this is by the worst car i have test drove. Let  me start off when i left the lot to the main street i tried to punch it because it was and entrance to a highway and the car hesitate so bad its like it doesn't have the power my foot demand and it gets stuck in gear for long period of time it is as bad as the first version of nissan cvt transmission, from 1st to 2nd gear the car went to 3500 rpm and was there for a good 4 sec untill it finally changed to second this was the same thing from second to third and it shifted hard as if the transmission was slipping or something. As you doing a rolling stop and try to step on the gas there is a bad delay for the car to respond ,  its confused on what gear to go into and so  one time it went to a higher  gear and almost stalled. this is as bad as the hyundai santa fe issues if not worse, another thing i hated was the start and stop i know its new technology yea it saves fuel but its going to be harder on the engine and starter, but for toyota i give them an F for this system because as soon as you step off the gas it jerk the living **** out of you, i thought someone hit us  or something and the dealer guy was like thats the new system i just drove back and left cause that car it just horrible.      Some of you may think i dont know what im talking about but im a drag racer and only feel a car jerk like that either when some one hits you or when i gas it on my race car for a car like this highlander just to jerk you every time at light it bad eventually the jerking will ause the car to crack something in the unibody i know you can shut it off but still what the purpose of having it if does this. also to add to the car hesitation for a car with 295 it seems very weak the sorento has 280hp and its plenty powerful, even my dad old towncar is more powerful and it only has around 200hp and weighs 4000lbs. so please people think again if you want to buy these new highlander give them a through test drive and youll see what im talking about",neg
"Check out the front grill front fenders and parking lights all get loose fenders pull away from grill very loose had into dealer they did not fix problem .will be taking it back again .paid way too much for this vehicle for this to be happening this is my 3 rd hylander but my last one .very dissatisfied with Toyota paid $34,000",neg
"We set a decibel meter in the the cabin and at 70 mph the 93 db reading requires hearing protection by the federal government.  You get engine noise at low speed and tire noise along with wind noise at speeds higher than 45 mph.  The engine always seems to act as if it is working to keep up at the 55 - 65 mph  and the fuel mileage on two long trips of Interstate in excess of 300 miles has not been above 19.7 miles per gallon, currently only have 4100 miles on auto.   JBL radio speakers are poor and there is not a setting that will pair volume with increased sound so in town at 40 mph your radio volume is set at 12 for volume and on the highway at 70 mph you need to turn the radio up to a setting of 28.  This is my forth Toyota and it will be my last.",neg
"I wish I had read the Consumer Affairs complaints before buying my 2016 Toytota Highlander XLE.   I've only owned my car for 30 days and already had an issue with the car starting on its own.  Yes!  That's right.  I walked up to my car after shopping at WalMart for 40 min. only to find that it had started up by itself, and must have been running while I was in the store with the doors locked.  Upon entering the car, a yellow caution light was flashing near the odometer.  I read many consumer complaints and found another person complaining of the same problem and was told that it can happen when the remote entry keypad is pushed twice after exiting the vehicle.  After reading many other customer complaints about various issues with 2013-2015 brakes not working while driving (Yikes!), driver doors not unlocking, and front seats making loud noises while driving, I wish I had read those complaints before purchasing this vehicle.  It sounds like the 2013, 2014, and 2015 may be lemons.  I'm not sure about the 2016 yet, because the car is too new to know for sure, but I'm very concerned about what's to come.  I don't feel 100% safe in this car, especially since I have 2 kids.  This is my 2nd Toyota.  I just sold my 2006 Sienna minivan and it had many defective issues/recalls.  I will not be buying a Toyota in the future because they don't stand behind their cars.  They only try to blame the customer for their defects.
UPDATE after 30 days of driving - The sound system is terrible.  My Sienna minivan had a JBL sound system which was great, but the Highlander has a cheap sound system with a horrible muffled sound.  After driving the car a little while, you will notice that the interior has many cheap parts!!  The floor ""carpet"" is actually felt, not carpet, and some of the dash has plastic parts.  The front seats and angled headrest are very uncomfortable on longer rides.  Wish I could trade my new XLE in for a well made car that matches the price I paid.  The quality just isn't in the 2016 Highlander for the high price.   Still disappointed.",neg
Toyota refuses to acknowledge that there is a problem with intermittent buzzing sound. I complained to two dealerships but Toyota said it is as designed. COME ON!!!!,neg
"I tried this car in West Covina Penske CA and felt this car hmm.. rear third row seat too small and not soft comfort and can't fit for adult. -1 point The baggage in trunk back too small another 1 point less. The looks outside no LED daylight at front light and rear light. Others like Honda Pilot and Ford Explorer already LED front daylight and LED rear light. For dashboard, looks cheaper all plastic. So this is the bad looks interior too, however give it 1 point for accelarion better than 0 point.",neg
"We now have about 13K miles on the Toyota and remain disappointed in our purchase. We have had continual bouts with the radio/nav system just completely shutting down (in the middle of a route) and restarting - I mean the radio shuts off! The fact that the nav screen is not recessed or protected results in a glare that make the screen at time unusable. In addition the bluetooth will arbitrarily cut off and not reconnect unless the car is stopped. I have read other reviews and other owners have reported the same problem with the radio and despite 2-3 replacements the radio is still doing the same thing so I'm not sure what our options are. As stated earlier the sun roof is virtually unusable from a noise perspective because when open the wind noise is so significant you can't carry on a conversation. I believe this has to do with the placement of the luggage rack in conjunction with the angle of the roof (poor engineering)That said its a ""practical"" vehicle and we have appreciated the all-wheel drive in the bad weather.",neg
"The Highlander used to be one of the best rides around, however, the latest version is a real kidney shaker. This may be fine for those who wish to tear around corners, but it's brutal on a long distance drive. Although the Limited version has better suspension, it still falls short of the earlier models.",neg
The passenger does not have full power front seat as the driver does. Very important to have the power lumbar and to raise the seat up!  And we do NOT want 3rd row. Make an option for bench seat and only seats 5!  Then we would have purchased.  We chose the FORD Edge Titanium because it has the features we need!!!!!,neg
"Toyota is the most expensive brand out there based on their internal ""agreements"" they have with dealerships. You get a lot more car for your money looking at other brands. Too much money for the quality of their cars. Materials are borderline cheap and finishes are poor. Interior design is small and not. As comfortable as other brands.",neg
"Worst braking system of any vehicle I have ever owned and I am 64 and a huge car buff. Have owned no less than 10 Toyota's and my family in the last few years bought over $250,000 worth of Toyota vehicles. Plan on a trip to the dealership often and for the same repeated problems. Unfortunately the company has become complacent like GM once did and we all know how that turned out. The brakes on the Highlander,the Tundra and Sequoia are horrible when it comes to the wear and tear and they will NOT stand behind them. Arrogance comes to mind when I think about the direction Toyota has taken and I would welcome any conversation with potential buyers to share my very negative experience with Toyota vehicles.

"Knowing what I know now, I have complete buyers remorse.  It does not hold its value.  It's a complete rip off.  Toyota Finance is a complete rip off.  They need to realize the true facts about their American made ford parts being assemble in Mexico is false advertisement.  I have a Toyota body, with who knows how many cheap parts are used.  I will never by a Toyota again, the sad thing is who would want to by any highlanders, the trade in value doesn't come close to being the amount it should be.  Complete buyers remorse.  Stay away from Toyota's.  Buy a Ford, It is American, by a Chevy it is American.  But if I were to by an European car.  It will be a true European Car.   Not happy about the true facts about Toyota after the purchase.  Lesson Learned.  I would come out a whole lot better if I turned the car in due to not holding their value for the price you will pay.  Not to mention, Toyota Finance is repo happy, I think the reason is they want to make payments teetering on the edge of way too high so people default.   I say let them have it if they won't work with you and be reasonable...After all the parts are not Toyota parts.  They are assembled in different places in the US, but mostly Mexico.  So there you have it, the absolute truth about Toyota and their high repo problem with Toyota Finance.  If you still want one after reading this statement of fact.  Do not use Toyota Finance, they are prideful of the millions of 2015-16 repo action.  Funny, even the dealership expressed or said and I quote,"" this SUV will last you a long time if it's not repossessed first."" I should have questioned him on that statement but at the time I thought surely he is kidding?",neg
"Rear four wheel drive suspension making loud clunking noise when coming to stop from backing up or going forward. Dealer replaced both lower arms twice, swapped shocks and coil packs with no change in noise. District Toyota rep when  for ride with me and heard the noise as well. Stated that its the normal characteristic of this car and if enough people complain maybe Toyota will come up with a fix. This is unacceptable when you pay $45,000.00 for an SUV. Also the front drives seat is very uncomfortable as your left arm rests to low on the door hand rest. If they don't come up with a fix soon I will trade in for a Honda Pilot. I will never buy a Toyota again after this experience. Its been in the shop at least 8 times with no resolve. Just traded in for Honda Pilot because dealer and Toyota could not fix problem and said they do not have a fix. I will never buy a toyota again.",neg
The Nav. system is a total disaster to the point of being a danger to use.The seats are like concrete and the passenger seat does not articulate. the remote start has no range and works maybe one out of ten tries. The Hwy Mpg is about the same as my 400 hp 2012 Ram 5.7 Hemi PU and worse than the 5.3 v8 Envoy we traded in.The tire pressure monitor has no gage. No oil pressure gage or volt meter? What is this 1959? Dome lights put out about 2 watts and the factory hitch looks like it was put in with a chain saw. Radar cruise control or the manual resume takes a week to regain the loss of speed. We just returned from a 2000 mile trip in this brand new car and my wife and I have never hated a car more. I have owned at least 25 new cars in my life and have never been so disappointed. I do not care how much it cost. This turd is gone!,neg
"The buzzing sound from the servo motor will drive you crazy.   The buzzing sound occurs when the interior air is trying to sync with the exterior air.   The sound is  louder than a cell phone vibrating and occurs every 5-10 seconds.  We purchased a 2015 Highlander in May 2015 and started hearing the buzzing a week after the purchase.  Replacing the servo motor requires taking apart the dash - an expensive proposition.  Due to the expense, Toyota is taking the position that the noise in ""normal"" and not under warranty.  Many online forums reflect this issue - search buzzing, noise, servo motor, etc.  Don't forget that the buzzing is loudest when the exterior and interior air are similar.  If you buy the Highlander in the Winter, the buzzing will drive you crazy come Spring.",neg
"The front view has blind spots, and rear view mirrors are limited. I have had constant problems with the technology.  The radio skips, I'm unable to receive text messages.  The dealer claims it is a software issue, and Toyota can't keep up with all of the Droid, and iphone updates.  The dealership has tried to fix the tech issues, but are unable to resolve.",neg
"I can't believe i spent 40k on a new car, with the additional warranties we were promised would cover all electrical issues,  only to have this annoying buzzing sound every 15-30 seconds coming from dashboard. I've tried the dealer who finally admits this is an issue because they've lost a couple potential buyers, but it shouldn't have to come to this. Toyota should do the right thing and come up with a fix ASAP.  
Not a happy customer at all.",neg
"We too have one of the vehicles which makes an incredibly annoying intermittent buzzing sounds.  The dealer has blown us off, pretending like the sound is normal, but it's totally unacceptable.  Toyota customer support has been no help at all! Thanks to the Internet, we know we are not crazy or alone like Toyota wants us to think we are.

"When my husband and I bought this vehicle we were very excited. We thought we made the right decision on purchasing this 2015 Toyota Highlander. Now I'm afraid we made a big mistake. We started to notice this buzzing sound in the cabin. I thought I was the only one to noticed, until my 19 year old daughter sitting in the back seat asked me "" mom what is that buzzing sound"". Well now we all hear it, especially on long trips. I wrote an email to Toyota about this issue, haven't anything back yet.

"I own a 2003 Highlander limited that was built in Japan. Did not have any problems & I'm at 112k miles. Other than routine maint, tires,oil change etc. My battery lasted 12 years. We purchased a brand new Highlander Platinum loaded. Made the deal took the car home & found Dirt under the paint along with tiny areas where the paint was completely missing & you could see the primer below. If you take a look at most new highlander headliners in the corner of the sunroof opening you'll see the fabric is bunched up in the corners. They did not pull the fabric & stretch it out. Looks cheap. Control screen is far away & hard to reach & I'm 6'4""  Also look at the rear bumper at the seal when you open the rear hatch & see the over spray from the paint job that also looks cheap. For 45K plus you get no power tilt & telescopic steering wheel. Passenger only gets a 4 way power seat, Really Toyota !!. Also look at the cheap flashy wheel covers over the aluminum wheels, don't get that one ? Dealer was great and I was able to return the vehicle immediately for a full refund. Went and ordered us a brand new Acura MDX. I have no confidence in new Toyota's built here in the USA.",neg

"It is apparent that Honda is living in the shadow of their reputation from the 90's and 2000's. We just purchased a fully loaded  EX-L because of the bad reviews of the touring and elite having the 9 speed transmission.  The suv had only 8 thousand miles, and was purchased from a very reputable dealer.  After driving it for a few days, my wife noticed moisture in the front passenger floorboard. When I checked out the vehicle, the entire floorboard (All 4 doors)was completely saturated with water. The next thing we noticed was that the front passenger seatbelt was covered with mold. We took the vehicle to the Honda dealer to get it fixed. I called the service department after 24 hours to see what was going on. The service advisor said it was ready to go. I said wait, what was the issue? He said someone must have hit the button on the remote and made the windows go down in the rain.  I told him that was impossible, because we would have seen water on the seats, door panels, and everywhere else. So they kept the car for a few more days and said they found some seepage on the top rail molding and put some filler in it. He said it was finished and ready to go. I said what about the mold on the seatbelt? He said they cleaned it off, and they would not replace it. I said I was in the mold remediation business for many years, and you cannot just clean mold from porous surfaces. So he said he would talk to his boss. I got a call later from the advisor saying he has never lied to his customers and he wasn't going to start. He said they found a significant amount of water inside the seatbelt retractor.and they were getting an engineer to take the vehicle to a rain machine to do tests, and he didn't know when we would get it back. So a few more days later they found some bad welds or seams under the vehicle, and said they repaired it and ordered new carpet. I ask what about the moldy seatbelt. They refused to replace the seatbelt, so I let him know that we were not going to take the vehicle back. We have a baby, and she would not be riding in a vehicle that we paid $35k for, and has mold and bad welds. We decided to try out a touring pilot since there were no others to choose from. As soon as we checked the carpet on the 2017 touring, it was soaked on the passenger side. That was the end of Honda for us. We traded for a 2017 Toyota Highlander and are very happy we are through with Hondas.",neg
"I really love my 2017 Pilot ex-l.  Lots of room and fits my teenage boys, 130 lbs dog, and all of our stuff perfectly.  Great mix of options - even at base level -  I was a bit disappointed that it does not have heated side mirrors, even though my 2008 Odyssey ex-l had it.  I have about 8K miles on it... and recently have experienced the audio screen going black - only audio - the screen works otherwise.  Honda has no service updates, and has no records of this being an issue on 2017 models - though there is plenty of problems documented on the piloteers board - for earlier models.    I am hoping it is just a loose fuse and it not an indication of bigger problems.",neg

Pilot can be bought with the navigation system only in the top trim models and these also have the 9-speed transmission. I took a test drive on the freeway and when accelerating onto the freeway to merge safely with traffic I floored the accelerator pedal and then waited a full 4 seconds before the transmission downshifted and the car computer fed more fuel to the engine and the car started to accelerate. When I simulated a passing situation by moving into the left lane and flooring the accelerator pedal the same thing happened. No response at all for 4 seconds and then finally the car started to accelerate. The published 0-60 MPH times with the Pilot are not at all accurate with the 9-speed transmission. Add 4 seconds to the time and you will appreciate why I do not consider the Pilot safe to drive on the highway. The other con for me was the feel of the electronic steering where there was no feedback and it was further complicated by the odd profile of the steering wheel that is rectangular rather than round. The storage space is exceptional with the Pilot and the navigation system that uses Garmin technology like that found in the Garmin 760 is outstanding and the best of any SUV at this time. I would only buy one of the two trim levels that have the 6-speed transmission and based on that I decided to instead buy a 2018 Chevy Traverse.,neg
Bought new with 180 miles on it. Dealer claimed it came from another dealer to trade for a car someone wanted.  It has loud noise when hitting bumps in right rear and it's aggravating.  Thinking of selling.,neg
"I know I should love this car and I know old ladies shouldn't swear.  But, I freaking hate this car and wish I had bought an older model, which is sad because I haven't bought a new car in 13 years!  1)Auto Stop - if you are stopped for a tiny amount of time, the engine will shut off and restart when you move the steering wheel or take your foot off the brake.  IT IS UNNERVING!!  When I bought the car, the dealer said you can turn that irritation off but he meant you have to turn it off every time you start the car.  2)The freaking BEEPING - you can turn the incessant beeping off and risk backing into a brick wall if you're not used to the camera, or you can leave it on and have it annoy the living @!#%& out of you - when you're backing out of an underground spot with nothing for 2-3' in any direction, when you're rounding a tight turn on your daily trip home (??????), or when it thinks you're too close to a car in front of you - I'm not yet dead, I'm not blind, if I'm that close to a car in front of me it's because I WANT TO BE!!  3)The incredibly stupid feature that unlocks all the windows - my boyfriend says it's unlocking the doors, then holding the unlock button down.  However, it happened to me when I LOCKED the car and not sure what got pressed as the key jostled in my purse.  In any case, who EVER wants all their windows opened unless they're IN THE CAR?  I live in Seattle - rain, rain and more rain, twice now in my car completely accidentally.  In summary of the features, TOO $%^&& MUCH! When I want a driverless car, I'll get one, til then LET ME DRIVE THE CAR!!!!!  And finally, I don't know if it's suspension or what, but going over  speed bumps or into a big profile driveway  (dozens of times a day for most people), is  detrimental to your spine.",neg
"This is our 4th New SUV in 13 years.  This is the first one I have ever had to take to the dealer with a problem before 70,000 mile.  This car developed a clunk in the front drive train or suspension at about 3000 miles.  Of course the service department can find nothing wrong with it.  Honda is behind it's competitors when it comes to interior design.  Less leg room in the front driving compartment, controls are dated, other companies have lessen to their focus groups.  I think Honda miss the boat here.  Blind spot camara is useless, who looks at their center screen when changing lanes.  Really missed the boat here when comparing them to there competitors.  To many bad interior design features to mention.",neg
"It doesn't feel like an SUV.  It's like a car combined with a mini van. Loose steering, slow draggie start up, sits lower so not able to treat like SUV. Lower interior limits hauling anything large.  Seller was very limited on the knowledge of the vehicle and, until I received the owner's manual, I didn't realize the limitations on the stereo/interface system that doesn't meet my needs.  Irresponsible information from the seller caused ordering of wrong equipment.  Overall disappointed with this vehicle and wish I had looked elsewhere.

"After 40K miles the cylinders are shot, no warranty, no help from the dealership for the $1500 repair.  I have never owned a car where major engine work was needed in the first 2 years of ownership.  Don't buy the Honda Pilot..engine is the worst.",neg
"LA little over a year ago we sought to replace our 2007 Toyota Sequoia.  With three growing children, we needed a larger SUV and wanted something more fuel efficient than the Sequoia. The 2016 Pilot seemed like a great choice with a fair amount of cargo space and really cool features. Thought we were lucky when we were one of the first to own the new Pilot in July 2015 but turns out we were not so lucky after all.
The good:
Technology galore: state of the art transmission that shuts off at stop lights to save fuel, side mirror camera, back up camera, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warnings, accident collision assistance, multiple USB connections, memory seats (I’m 6’4” and my wife is 5’4”)and a touch screen radio with XM radio that has memory and allows me to pause and replay songs. Oh, and whenever I change the channel, it brings me to the beginning of a song currently being played so I don’t have that feeling of “darn, just missed it!”.  Fantastic highway gas millage with up to 36 mpg on a 120 mile drive into the Poconos and finally, very easy access to the third row for my 8 year old.
The bad:
Second row space was not as roomy as I thought and my 6’ teenage son constantly put his knees in the backs of the driver or passenger. Lane departure is flat out annoying with the wheel shake while taking a turn a little tight (sorry, I am an aggressive driver).  Fuel door wasn’t flush to the body of the vehicle.  Fingerprints all over the radio screen.  Adaptive cruise control SLAMS on the breaks when it is not necessary and when driving on a winding road and there is an approaching vehicle on the other said of the road, the Pilot detects that we might have a head on collision. Idle stop did not always work and sometime heisted when starting back up at stop lights. 
The ugly:
My wife HATED this vehicle. Too much technology for her and every so often the radio sound “flickers” and the only remedy is to shut the car off completely and restart (terribly annoying). We even had a couple of occasions when the radio/nav screen was completely blank/off. So while the technology seemed exciting, it needs work. Should have known better to buy a new model. Guess we just expected more from Honda. 
The result:
A year later we traded the Pilot in at a loss for a used 2015 Sequoia Limited which I should have done in the first place. Would have saved me $7K but that is how much we disliked the Pilot.  Seeing the transmission problems so many people had, glad we took the loss and moved on.  It is a shame because we pretty much owned at least one Honda since 1996. That streak came to an end 20 years later and not sure if/when Honda will be our choice again.",neg
"My wife wanted to trade our Mercedes GL450 for a new 2016 Pilot Elite. She liked the new design and the features on the Elite cannot be matched on similar vehicles. Her parents have had several Honda's. This was our first. Within the first 1ok miles we had several software recalls. One was for the computer adding miles to the odometer when the car was turned off. Not sure how many miles, but they extended the warranty 12k miles. At 16k miles the transmission started chirping between 3rd and 4th gear. I was told it just needed a firmware reflash. I shared information that suggested otherwise, but the dealer refused to listen. Picked it up the next day and asked if it still chirped. The answer was yes, but that I would have to drive it 40 miles for the system to reteach itself. Drove it 60 and took it back the next day with a louder chirp. Shared several pages from previous owners that stated there was a broken part in the transmission that cross contaminated engine coolant with transmission fluid. Shared that with the dealer. He asked what the resolution was and I told him a new transmission. Turns out I was right. Fast forward to 33k miles. Received a letter from Honda stating that our car now needs a new radiator, all new hoses and O rings and they need to test the engine to make sure it was not damaged. This is all from the original transmission issue. While the car was being repaired, I traded it on a 2016 Lexus GX460. I have been a loyal Toyota/Lexus/Scion user for many years and never should have let my wife talk me into this Honda Pilot. First and last Honda I will ever own! BTW, she loves the new Lexus.",neg
"I brought this car in a new condition happily because it seemed really good. After a few months of driving it the engine light kept going on and there was a problem with the emition system. The dealer fixed it and told me it was an injector problem.  2 months later the sign came back with the emition system. The dealer said it was the catalytic converter. They cleaned it and said it was okay but after one week the sign had returned. This really changed my mood and I only drove for 50,000 miles so far. I'm wondering as to what should I do but I do not recommend Honda. Hope they do better next time.",neg
"We purchased a 2016 Pilot Elite and loved it at first!  Then the maintanance lights started popping up (Emissions system problem) at around 20,000 miles.  Catalytic converter was replaced.  Lights came back on like a Christmas tree shortly after.  Fuel injectors were replaced.  Lights back again and this time they said we had bad fuel.  We had a lot of delayed acceleration problems.  The air conditioner started going out.  The dealer always helped us, but they couldn't make the vehicle more reliable. We ended up with 30,000 miles on this vehicle before we sold it and took the loss.  Please research this trim model.",neg

"I hope it doesnt.  In fact I hope you read this, avoid buying the 2016 (or 17) Honda Pilot, and avoid the same mistake our family made.  When my wife and I test drove the 2016 Honda Pilot we were not terribly impressed with its acceleration but that was not why we were looking at a new Honda.  We were looking for something reliable and Honda has had a great track record in that regard.  So, even though we were not over the moon about the Pilot when we test drove it, we thought this is going to last 10+ years and is, therefore, a wise purchase.  Boy, were we wrong!   One problem with the Honda Pilot is the 9 speed transmission.  My 1972 Chevelle shifts smoother than this.  When you drop this Honda in drive first thing in the morning, the first-second gear shift will try to separate a few vertebrae... it is brutal.  Once warmed up, this transmission is better, but still not so good.  Especially in stop and go traffic where you will experience many times where the transmission seems completely out of touch with the throttle, leading to ""rev rev rev... wham!"".  You *will* need a chiropractor if you have to drive in stop and go traffic with this machine.  Also, this transmission has a history of early failure already.  However, that transmission won't be the thing that kills you.  The Honda Sensing system will.  Lets say that you are on a highway going 70 mph when someone going 20 mph slower than you pulls out 3 car lengths in front of you.  In that situation our Honda Pilot will SLAM on the brakes HARD causing anyone behind us to weave desperately into the adjoining lane or shoulder to keep from hitting us in the rear.  Or lets say that you are going around a bend on a country road, the Honda Sensing system gets confused and again SLAMS on the breaks in the middle of hard bend.  Lets say you survive the Honda Sensing system... will you be able to survive the throttle?  Lets say you are in stopped trying to turn left across rapidly moving traffic.  You need your car to move when you step on the gas.  The Honda Pilot will occasionally toss in a 5-7 second delay in response time, just to add to the challenge.  Did I mention the $200 oil changes?  This is because, in our case, about the time we needed to change the oil, the ""B16"" code would be thrown on the info system, indicating that the rear diff also needed to be changed.  This prompted the service manager at our local Honda shop to exclaim, ""what is wrong with these new Pilots?!""",neg
"Our family purchased a 2016 Honda Pilot Elite based on Honda's good reputation and experience we've had with other Honda vehicles.  Unfortunately the 2016 Honda Pilot Elite, which comes with the 9 speed transmission, has serious transmission problems .  We travel a lot and after owning the vehicle for 1 1/2 years already have 69 thousand miles on our Honda Pilot Elite.  Problems with the transmission started at 53 thousand miles while driving on the highway at which time the vehicle's transmission went out unable to shift out of the gear it was in.  Multiple display warning lights came on causing us to drop the car off at a Honda dealership out of town while on vacation.  The dealership recognized the transmission issue which reset itself after the car was parked in their shop for several hours.  Diagnostic testing failed to reveal any defects.  After picking up our vehicle which appeared to be functioning normally, the same problems started againg at 69 thousand miles.  After bringing our vehicle in to the local Honda dealership additional tests were done.  The transmission problem was again recognized by the Honda Service department, however no diagnosis was able to be made after updating software, changing transmission fluid and consulting directly with Honda Corporate.  We were lead to deal with Honda Corporate regarding our transmission issue as the vehicle's transmission was now no longer under warranty (ending at 60 thousand miles).  Although the initial transmission issue occurred at 53 thousand miles Honda has refused to cover the cost of our transmission.  The customer service at Honda Corporate was not what we expected from a reputable company such as Honda. Our Honda has been in the shop for 1 1/2 weeks now without having any work done on it since Honda will not agree to cover our transmission problem.  Since the Honda dealership was unable to diagnose the transmission problem while under warranty, they felt justified in passing the bill to us, the Honda customer.   We followed the Honda maintenance schedule and brought the vehicle in when the service lights presented themselves on our display.  It is apparently recommended that the Honda Pilot undergo transmission fluid changes every 30 thousand miles costing approximately $250 each service.  Our Honda Pilot was at the Honda dealership at 32K and 45K miles and thereafter, it was never recommended to us to change the transmission fluid.  Honda Corporate appeared to use this information against us to hold us responsible to pay for the failed transmission.  A district manager from Honda made a decision that we'd be responsible for $750 of the repair while Honda would cover the rest of the $6200 transmission.  Although better than paying for a new transmission, this problem occurred while under warranty and Honda is not living up to their promise or reputation.  The district manager who is responsible for deciding how much the Honda customer is responsible for paying apparently will not speak directly to the Honda customer, interesting to us.  We have already incurred the cost of a rental car while on vacation due to this problem and will be without our Honda Pilot for at least 2 1/2 weeks for the transmission repair not including the number of hours dealing with various customer service representatives getting to the point we are at now waiting for our transmission repair.  We are disappointed with Honda's handling of our transmission problem which will inevitably affect many more Honda owners in the future as most drivers of these vehicles have yet to place as many miles on the 2016 Honda Pilot as we have.",neg
"I can't seem to get anywhere with customer care so I am going to share my story in hopes of saving others from my misfortune with the newly designed Honda pilot. I bought a 2016 Honda pilot last February.  Last week, my air conditioning began to blow warm air.  I took it to a Honda dealership for a diagnostic assessment assuming that whatever was wrong would surely be covered under warranty with a car that is barely a year old.  I get a call stating that they aren't really sure and it may have been that a rock hit my condenser and that is not covered.  The dealership stated  that they see this all the time and it is in ""a vulnerable place at the front of the car.""  I have hit absolutely nothing and have never even heard of such a possibility happening on any other car I have owned.  The fix is $1200 on a basically BRAND NEW CAR.  Please others be aware of this design flaw in the new Pilot and purchase something else.  This is the first and last Honda I will ever own as I have been let down and feel as if I have been swindled by the company.  The employee said that the condenser does have a screen which meant the pebble must have been tiny.  So, apparently the tiniest of pebbles can take out an entire air conditioner in a Honda.",neg
"Honda & Honda dealer does not care about you, they have your money & tough. I drive with a sign on the back of the car.  The new car radio is crap dealer say's it's fine                  
  9/30/2017 spoke .with Walter a regional case manager, he said there is no fix for the sound system. I do feel it is the radio because I can play my 30-year-old walkman transistor radio through the car speakers and it sounds good. Honda is still putting them radios in 17 pilots and crv.I also filed a claim with the national enter for dispute settlement and 2 weeks before the review Honda offered me 4 hundred dollars to withdraw my claim and the next week they went up to 1,750.dollars and they still said it works like it was designed.",neg
"We leased the 2016 Pilot with the expectation we were getting the same quality as the last 3 Pilots we leased.  This was not the same Pilot we had come to love.  This vehicle is tinny - the vibration and awful performance are staggering.  We recently took it on a 10 hour road trip. It was like sitting on an airplane next to the motor.  As we traveled down the highway I felt as if the hood was going to peel back like a sardine can.  I am hoping the dealership will take the vehicle back as we have just exceeded our 30 day period.  I should have been more aware of the fact there were 3,200 miles on the vehicle when we leased it realizing someone already knew what I was about tho find out.  I would not recommend this vehicle to anyone.",neg
"All Pilots come without a CD player – something that sales people should point out! It costs about $280 to have Honda add one. I had Honda add one. I drive a lot and listen to books on CD while I drive. It is important to me that the car remember where the CD left off when I turn off the car. That way it will continue the story when I start driving again. About 10-20% of the time the car forgets where it was and starts the CD from the beginning. I've owned 4 Toyotas, A Mitsubishi, and a Subaru and this has never happened with any of them. Otherwise, the infotainment system is a mess. It is not at all intuitive. It is difficult or impossible to operate with gloves on (I live in northern NY and it is cold in the winter). The voice commands are finicky. It forgot all the speed dial numbers that I manually entered!  The infotainment display occasionally gets stuck - an obvious software bug. As for the rest of the car, it downshifts too far when accelerating quickly. I pull a boat and admittedly, the car is good at that. The driver's seat is comfortable but the driver's seat arm rest tilts down at an odd angle and is next to worthless. The battery is inaccessible - I cannot use the car to jump start my tractor! In short, this could be a good car but it is plagued with a series of small but annoying design flaws and software bugs. Honda has been unresponsive to my complaints about the CD player.",neg
"I bought my Pilot in November 2015. Out the gate I have had problems with the entertainment system. Problems consist of hands free button not recognizing my voice, dropped calls, people saying it sounds like I'm in a wind tunnel (even though all the windows are up and A/C is off), radio stations not showing on the display, voice recognition system not being able to distinguish what name is being said, system randomly re-booting while driving, calls not being transferred to car system. There are more problems but I think you get the idea. I have an Iphone 6S (IOS 10.2.1). I have also tried paring a Samsung and LG phones to the system and still the problems exist. In the last 6 months I have had the entire info system replaced, the FM receiver replaced, and 2 software updates. Problems still exist. I have a case open with Honda USA and now (as of February 24th the dealer is saying that I have to live with the problems with the info system. I will be contacting Honda USA again. No one should have to live with a problem with a new vehicle especially after spending >$35k for the vehicle. In addition to the info system problems I am experience problems with the vehicle locking (or lack there of) while walking away. The dealer has replaced a sensor in the drivers door and a proximity sensor in the car but the problem still exists. Other issues include the wipers malfunctioning and the spin control system kicking in when the vehicle isn't spinning. I have owned Honda's in the past but they did a poor job on the new Pilots.

Update 3/13/17

On March 9, 2017 I was parked in a parking lot waiting for my daughter. As I started the vehicle I received 3 warnings which stated the following: 1) Brake system problem; 2) charging system problem; and 3) Anti-lock brake system problem. I had the vehicle towed to the nearest dealer through the Honda Emergency Road Service. The dealer is still working on the vehicle to figure out the problem.",neg
"I have a Honda pilot 2016 LX model, this is my second Honda car. The experience with this car is horrible.
Recently, I noticed the water leaking into the car. During the rain in Fremont, CA, the water went inside the car all the way to the floor mat thru the dashboard. I took the car to the local Honda dealer to fix the leaking problem and inspect the dashboard and the floor. Water leaking could spread the rust quickly and may cause some electrical problem. A week later, I got my car back and within 2 days I noticed the water leaking problem is not fixed. I also noticed the metal inside the car dashboard is rusted. I believe, the service center didn’t inspect the dashboard, floor and find the root cause. Now, the car is at the same service center to fix the same problem.

The car has not only this problem, it had other problems like remote key was not working, tail light assembly was broken when I got the delivery, screws in rear of vehicle were stripped, takes too long to stop vehicle completely and ON and OFF smoking while driving.

The new car has too many issues, I’m also wondering how this car passed the quality control test and testing for water leaking.
 
My main concern is a safety since I have a newborn baby(5 months old) and a kid. I feel traveling with my family in this car may cause issues like computer failure, sensor failure, etc., so I’m avoiding to drive this car with the family.

I don’t recommend this car.

Honda Customer Service

Honda customer service is also worst. I tried to contact the case manager, but I couldn’t reach him to know the status of the car. After several attempts, I reached him, he was simply saying busy with his work and he couldn’t answer all my questions, just saying “he is not a technical person”. I spent $ 35,000 to buy this car and it’s Honda’s responsibility to clarify all customers queries.",neg
"This car continues to have transmission issues.  Problems with upshifting when going down hill.   Car will speed up.   I've been in and out of serivce this past year.  Same story, and delays with getting the necessary parts.   My first and last HOnda.  I'm in the processing of trading this vehicl in for a Chevy Traverse or Buick Enclave.  Friends have these vehicles and have been very pleased.   My wife refuses to drive this vehicle.",neg
"Junk junk, junk just changing the radio station is dangerous.  The engine knocks when I turn corners.  My rear window will not go down.  When I put the car in park it slides several feet forward or back.  I have to use the emergency brake every time I park even on flat roads.  The gear fobs on the steering wheel are a mystery to me.  I could be on a freeway going 75 and accidentally hit one of those and my car downshifts into D6.  Very dangerous.  I can't seem to shift back unless i look down and desperatly get it back into drive.  I do not know how to bypass that feature even looking at my owners manual. My car is always dinging.  Why?  I can't get that to stop.  My drive button is no longer readable the plastic has worn off.  My exceleration is a total joke.  I have to put the gas pedal to the metal just to get it to go.  The windows fog up instantly making it hard to see. I need to blast the defroster or pull over till I can see.  I used to have the old pilot and I wish I would have kept it.  I am sure there is more that I have problems with.  We are looking to a another car company to trade in this piece of crap.  Actually running.  Over priced and worthless. On another note, I have mentioned these to the dealership and they just say that it is user error and they have had no complaints.",neg
"I owned a 2007 pilot, followed by a 2012 Odyssey, followed by last year we purchased a 2016 Honda Pilot Touring.  I love Hondas and really only had one car in mind when it was time to trade in my vehicle.  I have two small children so the entertainment system was definitely important.  I also drive a lot for work so a clear, easy to use Bluetooth is also a priority.  Honda features are great with no concerns.  Now the Bluetooth.  I have two iPhones 6 devices (one ATT and one Verizon).  When I go to make a call, it has to make a voice connection and THEN you have to touch transfer on the screen to get it to switch to Bluetooth.  So long for handsfree calling!!  I took it to Honda and they said it was a Handsfree Bluetooth issue and that I should contact them.  If you google it and look at their compatibility, it only is up to OS 8.3  (the current update was 10.2).  It does not even mention an iPhone 7, so good luck if you have that.  My second issue is the RES.  If you have a child that can work the remote, they can handle it from the back seat. Otherwise, you are screwed and will have kids yelling at you that the movie won't start and it started over every time you got back in the car while running errands.  (Once again, Honda says it is the new DVDs that just do not work).  If the DVD goes to a start menu, it will not start automatically.  Apparently, older DVDs may have an autoplay and those supposedly will work.  Either way, there is no control over the movie from the front seat.  After paying 48000 for a new Honda, it feels like a kick in the gut, when all of the older models are more sophisticated and operate better than the new 2016.",neg
"My previous car was a 2004 Honda Pilot. Loved it so much wanted another one. MISTAKE!  I have had it for one year. After six  months, I was aware of three problems. Neither of them could be fixed. 1.  Unable to start the car because I could not depress the brake enough to start it. This was a random problem.  Did not happen when I took it in to the dealership, so they had no idea how to fix it.  2.  Horrible shift from first to second gear. Takes and extra second to engage transmission. When I am accelerating, there is a noticeable lurch. Was told it is the way nine speed transmission works. Well, it is really bad!  Would think a more expensive car would be smoother! 3.  The entertainment system crashes and restarts. Once again, not every day, not every time I drive it. Once again, nothing wrong with the car.",neg
"Wait on buying this car.  Horrible, frequent, but random hard shifting w/ the 6 speed tranny.  Wife will not drive it anymore.   New 7/2016, we have 6K miles on it and the hard shifting is damaging the whole drive train..  Horrible new car experience.  Car is at the dealer for the 3rd time on this as I post this.  Looks like I'm not the only one..",neg
"I love Hondas. Have had a few. Was excited to purchase the 2016 Honda Pilot. We have had the Honda for 1 year and 2 months..it has approximately 19thousand miles. Unfortunately, as the time increases things are starting to break. The passenger windows have had problems going back up...once down it may take several minutes to get the windows to roll up. The dealership is going to replace some parts and hope this will allow them to work again. The  second row Passenger seat broke and was unable to move forward or back..the dealership fixed and I hope the other seats do not have problems. The biggest problem is the transmission. The engine started to make a chirping noise about 2 weeks ago when shifting into 4th gear or when you got to about 10/15 miles. I took it in to find out that it is unable to drive and will take 2 weeks to repair because it needs a new transmission.  I find it a little scary after researching on the web that this is a common problem. I contacted the dealership where I purchased the car to express my concern. They suggested I call Honda directly. I have done this and now have a case file and they are to contact me tomorrow. With 3 kids and reading a lot of reviews of transmission problems and brake problems will admit am a little scared to drive once they fix. How do I know that this will not happen again or something else? I can't get over the fact that it has only 19 thousand miles and only about a year old. My husband is ready to trade the car in and call it a loss. Recommend doing a bunch of research before purchasing this type vehicle.",neg

"I would not recommend for anyone else to buy a $50k+ SUV or car that is an electrical hot mess. the radio, navigation and entertainment system do not work properly even after an update was done by the dealer recently; it's 9 speed transmission makes noises when changing gears specially at around 27 to 30 MPH; it also some times while driving down hill with your foot on brake wants to accelerate rather than slow down... (not sure if it just another electrical problem and the dealer told me they are not sure is the noise is coming from the transmission)  the dealer has not been able to find out what the problem is after 2 days and over 150 miles of test driving it; now they have a field engineer from American Honda coming to take a look at it.",neg
"Worst mistake I ever made was buying a brand new 2016 Honda Pilot! My 2016 Pilot was purchased new in March 2016. I Drive about 30k a year so I wanted comfort and a brand that wouldn't leave me stranded as I ran up the miles. Little did I know that the issues would start at 5-7000k miles and by 18,000 mile I would just trade it in for a lose to get out of it and rental cars. 
May of 2016 my records show...No backup lights! Corrected lights and oil changed. Then the major issues started. First problem was the transmission searching for gears, ""that's normal, just v-tec"". Second was the AC only blows out of vents at a humid 67 degrees, 55 when they ""fixed"" it but in the South, that makes the air temp of the car a sticky 87+ depending on the weather, but ""that is normal"" and leaves you with a sweating butt, back, underarms and forehead. Fuel economy, that's a joke! 13.1 average but ""that is my driving style"". Fourth, popping in the front end, ""cannot duplicate"" although it's on safercar.gov as a reported issue.  Fifth, put the car in drive and it won't go! Well ""that's downhill assist and normal"". Sixth, car won't start but that ""can't be duplicated and it might have been because the driver didn't press the brake"".  Seven, no HEAT! So NO AC during the summer and now NO heat during the winter, that is ""just the new normal with these new EPA regulations"". Eight, the radio may or may not pickup local channels but ""that's normal"". Nine, the radio and camera dim to where you can't see it, but ""can't be duplicated"". Ten is when you press the gas to go while rolling and the transmission doesn't catch a gear, that my friends is why I traded this car today. Think turning left and car not going with traffic coming at you. Now I know why people sit at Left on Green when clear traffic lights! So I traded it in for a 4Runner. Info added per Edmunds email for update 6/6/2017: I lost the safety aspect of the survival cage that the Pilot has, my gas mileage is about 5 mpg better in the 4Runner, I lost the roomy comfortable interior and the awesome room of the cargo area and the storage tray in the rear. Other than those items, I have icy AC in a dark Toyota still in the same city and state that Honda said was ""normal"", I had heat this winter, and best of all....seven months in and I haven't had O.N.E. problem or issue with the 4Runner. Amazing huh? Especially since Honda said it was just me....Run and don't buy a Pilot or at least get a 2008-2015. I have friends who are still rocking theirs at 300k.
Update! I’m now 12k into my used 4Runner and it’s been a gem!!",neg

Acura has lost a lot of respect because of this 9 speed so WHY Honda do you put this in the new pilot???? Consumers Report has info on this issues saying to be careful or you'll be sorry. I trusted the Honda name so didn't do my homework before buying.

"Purchased my 2016 Pilot LX in late July -- what a mistake ; after 300 miles heard a popping noise in chassis / suspension when backing out and steering to move forward - very pronounced; brought in for service and the service rep said it was a bushing; well it re-occurred -- now 1500 miles and it is in the shop again -- guess what -- was told that Honda is aware of the problem BUT while no TSB is out , Honda mechanics tried another fix  with the driver's side wheel assembly and frame ...   will see how this holds up in a month. Otherwise, the LX remains a very good vehicle  ... just that after owning my share of American cars in the '60s and '70s where it was the norm to visit the dealership within a week oe two for defective issues, I have gotten ""spoiled"" in owning good foreign cars where a visit to the shop is only for scheduled maintenance.
Update  12/15/2016- the popping noise has returned -- so much for Honda Quality unless totally built in Japan.
Update  12/16/2017 - been to the service dept twice where an attempt was made to fix this problem -- not successful.. so I bought the proverbial lemon",neg

Do not buy a Honda until they replace the current infotainment system!  Screen goes dark randomly and often. Back up camera frequently does not come on.

Said it may not be compatible even though it works fine about 50% of the time. Car purchased new and now has only 5000 miles.

"I purchased a 2016 Pilot Touring after my 2014 Pilot Touring had electrical problems. It was the worst decision that I have made. After 33 days, while backing out of my garage, I noticed a large puddle of fluid and drops leading out of the garage. I took the vehicle to the dealer the next day. On my way to the dealer, the transmission started slipping and there was a squealing noise. I was terrified, and knew that it was the transmission. After 2 hours at the dealer, they determined that it was the transmission, and that they would need to order a part. It would take 3-4 days to get the part and fix the car. Yes, FIX THE CAR, that I had owned for 33 days, and had paid $45,000 for. I told them that I did not want the car, and that they needed to give me my money back. They offered $39,500. So, I was going to be out $5,500 for a defective vehicle. I demanded to speak with the manager. After nearly 6 hours at the dealer, with my two kids, the manager offered $44,000. In total I was out $1,300, but was too tired to fight. Chalk it up to lesson learned. I now have no car, a stained garage, am out $1,300 and have to start the car shopping process again. Shame on you Honda.",neg
"The hood flaps in the breeze at high speed with a cross wind.  The push button transmission is a pain.  The automatic braking feature is dangerous.  I have had several near accidents because the brakes are automatically applied.  Instead of the brakes being applied normally, they are slammed!  The drivers behind me are none too happy.  I have learned a whole new language as they pass me and give me the one finger salute.  Getting my vehicle washed is a joke.  You have to go through a series of button pushing to keep the vehicle from being damaged.  Now, I have to take it to a self wash facility.  Honda has found a way to ruin the new car experience with a CD instead of an owners book.  there are several other things that are very annoying but not worth the trouble to list.  If you buy one, make sure you understand EVERYTHING about the operation of the vehicle before taking it off the lot.  This was my first and last Honda.

Your going to love the rear seat belts....trying to put them back into the ceiling when not in use...Nothing has change as far as my opinion of the Honda vehicle.  Over rated and over priced.  My next vehicle will be American Made!  
Regarding the hood flapping in the breeze:  I had the vehicle into the Honda service department for this problem twice and they could not fix it.  They blamed the ""Honda"" bug deflector for the problem so I called the Zone Office and explained to the problem I was having.  A snotty woman told me that because the bug deflector was and ""after market"" product, they couldn't/wouldn't help me.  I tried several times to explain to her that the bug deflector was a Honda product to no avail.  SO-----I took off the bug deflector and took the vehicle for a ride......YUP!  Hood still flaps in the breeze at highway speeds and is very unsafe.  SO----- I called the zone office again and explained the situation to the person that answered the phone.  I was told that I would have to take it into the Honda dealer.  When I explained that I had already done that more than once, I was told there is nothing Honda can do.  JUNK, JUNK, JUNK.",neg
"Very weird shifting/braking.  At slow speeds, ""phantom braking"" causes sudden deceleration. Push start only works if I'm pushing very hard on the brake.  JUST INCREDIBLE to me that the car is not compatible with Apple CarPlay, a technology that's been around for years. Lack of integration makes everything clunky. Want your car to narrate incoming text messages for you? Don't buy a Pilot.  Honda claiming it's a hardware issue and can't retrofit, even though Accords have it. Boggling.  Dash is glitchy - sometimes auto-dims at night, other times I have to open settings and manually dim it.  Stupid detail, but that huge display screen tells me almost nothing. Listening to a song on the radio and want to know what it is? It will display 8-10 characters only, leaving half the screen blank.  This car was not designed to thrill a driver.  Vexing, yes.  I would recommend people spend more time looking at the Highlander.",neg

"Loved the Elite. Great car. Took it to Telluride  and San Diego from El Paso during the summer both about 9 hour drives. Splurged for the AWD, top of the line. Last week when I was driving it , I noticed the transmission jerking and not shifting appropriately. Mind you I did two summer cruises in this car. Few days later my wife tells me the car is accelerating in a jerking way. I told her I noticed it too and suggested we take it to the dealer. Guess what, the computer found nothing. The car is not the same. They have a new fancy 9 speed transmission and it has PROBLEMS!  I did a quick Google search and I am not alone. Honda is not addressing it , like the Takata air bag issues. BTW I have a 2009 Ridgeline waiting for new air bags to arrive on recall. I will open up a case with Honda North America and take it back to the dealer if the problem persists. I am sure they will say it's my imagination. My options are burn the car, sell the damn thing or trade it in for a lower level pilot with the old 6 speed transmission. I should have known a new model with new this, that new fancy transmission might have new PROBLEMS. My Mercedes CLS 500 the first year they made it has been in the shop more times than I can count. I thought Honda was different than the fancy German cars but I was wrong. It was the Pilot, Audi Q7, Toyota Highlander, and several others with 3 rd row of seats my wife looked at. Honda had the best reviews, picked 2016 SUV of the year. That's why we bought it.  Now I am ready to crash the damn thing into the dealership and set it on fire. Buyer be ware. The new fancy 9 speed transmission has problems. Others might not notice it . It can be a subtle difference, but we did because of our summer road trips. I guess a few dozen people have to die for Honda to wake up. Just like the air bags.",neg

"We bought the 2016 Pilot Elite in December since we were expecting twins in July. Due to owing previous Honda's in the past we though this was the route to go. Long story short, my wife was 9 months PREGNANT and pulling the Pilot into the driveway when it lurched forward, avoiding the other car in the driveway she went down our front lawn hitting a curb resulting in all side airbags to deploy. She was rushed to the hospital for testing, luckily nothing happened to the babies but $11k in damage. When we called HONDA to explain, there response was why didn't you have it towed to the HONDA dealership instead of the body shop. We got a case open with a lady named Marion, who is a complete IDIOT, finally after arguing with her for an hour she sent a rep to the dealership near me and he too k it for a test drive with me and driving it himself saw that the car tends to lurch forward, came back to dealership and ran a diagnostics and showed me that there is an computer malfunction that they need to reprogram it, after 4 attempts realized the unit is bad and need to be replaced and as I am leaving tells me ""oh we got it to work"". Back to American Honda, the rep Marion calls and says we didn't find anything that was wrong from the report that we received other then a software update. I requested a copy of the error code they found at HONDA and the local HONDA rep kept avoiding the question. If anyone has had a similar issue with there new 2016 Pilot, please post so we can build up a case against HONDA, before someone seriously gets hurt in these SUV's. American HONDA refuses to acknowledge these problems until enough people come forward with it.",neg
after paying close to 50K the dealer can not still find whats the problem with the idle stop and navigation. since first day the navigation signals bars are in red  sometimes in green but when is in red it looses actual location. I live in washington DC so I expected to have the green bars all the time.  the iddle stop does not work after 1800K it stop working. If someone has the same problem please let me know,neg
"Update:  I have now owned the car almost two years.   I would likely not buy another Pilot until they update the transmission.  First to second is slow to shift and not smooth, there are times it take 5 seconds to go from reverse to drive, and it can be very slow to downshift.   I also get a slow speed downshift squeak that is repeatable but the dealership can’t fix.  I have had some minor other issues with the stereo (random clicking and popping) and a squeaky drivers side door during driving.  The start stop feature is terribly implemented and it annoys me that I cannot permanently disable it.

This could be a great car but Honda chose gas mileage above drivability.  The transmission is a deal killer and would keep away from any car with the horrible ZF 9 speed.  I will reconsider driving one when the new 10 speed is implemented.

On a non Typical note for Honda- why in the world would they implement a navigation system that has audio notifications of traffic when the navigation system is off?  It makes the stereo randomly beep for no reason even if the traffic is many miles ahead.  Stupidest engineering choice I have seen in a vehicle in a long time.

Original:  After two weeks of ownership I have virtually no buyers remorse.  I feel I must preface this review by stating that it is based in comparison off my previous vehicle, a 2010 Audi Q5 3.2, which was a great car with virtually no issues at 92k miles.  This car is vastly different, but that is ok.  It is big.  In fact, surprising big for most people who have seen it.  There really is a ton of room, recently taken 4 tall young adults and 2 parents on a two hour trip with no complaints, even from the third row.  The ride is on the soft side, but I knew this was not going to a sporty small German SUV.  You can feel the weight through turns but there is minimal body lean and the extra weight makes this thing a exemplary freeway cruiser.  It is far quieter than the Audi and the chassis seems more solid with far less shutter with sudden bumps in the road.  The interior materials are fine for the most part.  I would have liked some wood in the touring model and the piano black gloss trim picks up fingerprints (and I foresee lots of scratches in the future) but otherwise things are soft with little ultra hard plastic.  The engine and transmission combo is interesting but I dont find it as bad as some of the magazines have found it to be.  Maybe I have a new software version but things generally run smoothly but, given the 9 speeds, it does shift a lot.  I have found no issues during deceleration, but around 40-45 and 55-60, the ratios seem like they are too close.  Unfortunately, those are common speeds and so if feels like it is searching a bit.  The shifts are not abrasive, just frequent.  The first gear is also really tall and takes some getting used to.  I have found the eco mode to be way too blunted and has earned the nickname ""grandma mode"" only to be used cruising on flat highways with cruise control on.   With eco off, things are fine but you do have to dive deep on the pedal to get any real acceleration.  I do wish the sport mode was more sporty.  It doesnt seem to alter the throttle response much and just seems to want to hold 2 gears lower than it normally would.  In the Audi, sport mode would totally change the demeanor of this vehicle.  Increase throttle response, make more aggressive shifting, and hold the appropriate gear longer (and not forever).  You can kind of replicate it with the paddles, but I do miss how the Audi was tuned and its too bad here, because this has a great engine.  The only regret is probably not splurging for the AWD.  The power pretty easily overtakes friction under load and there is mild understeer.  I do get great mileage (averaging 26mpg) in mostly SoCal freeway driving.  That's 2 mpg better than I was getting in the Audi.  The infotainment is fine, but would have been better with at least one knob for volume and power.  No Android/Apple play is a bummer in a vehicle this new and expensive and even though it uses a android based system, the ability to add apps is limited to what Honda will allow you to install, which is right now limited to iHeartRadio.  I would love to install Waze or Pandora or access one of the app stores from the browser.   Overall, its a great vehicle with some small quirks but hits a sweet spot with size, capability, and performance.  They will likely sell a ton.",neg
"I have owned several Honda Pilots. I lease them for 3 years and at the end of the lease I get another one. NP. 2 days ago I went to my dealer thinking I would leave with another Pilot. Let me state here that I work in the construction trades so I have to be on construction sites every day AND I have to carry specialized testing equipment. This new Pilot is an abomination! They have changed it into a station wagon. If you are a Soccer Mom maybe its a better design but as a true ""UTILITY VEHICLE"" its a joke.",neg
"I brought this car mid of last year and already put 21K miles on this car, recently the emission system failure light turn on and I already sent back to dealer for second time last week because light turn back again.  Dealer told me Cata Converter cap needs to be changed, fuel injectors need to be replaced and also fuel line pips need to be replaced too.  I am not sure what happened to this car and not sure dealer can fix the issue or not after replaced lots stuffs from car.!!! Tired of to keep bring my car back to the dealer and driving a small loaner car civic.",neg
"Do not buy this unless if you can live with crap entertainment system. Very poor metal cone like sound, smudge touch screen. Biggest issue is entertainment turns off when we stop engine from running. When starting engine, all blue ray unit will start the track from beginning. These vehicles are use for long trips. when having a break and starting again, blue ray also start running from beginning. My family hate this thing. Also would you believe it can only play USB drive when only engine is not running. Soon as engine starts, it says cannot read. Very poor quality.",neg
"Purchased July 2015 - Problems started in September 2015 with navigation and sound system. Navigation screen would go blank - and display a 'Clarion Extraframework has stopped' error. Dealer performed update to navigation system - error has not appeared since but sound system sounds terrible - sounds like an AM radio from the 1950's. Dealer tells us Honda is aware and working on problem - but still no fix and it is now July 2016. Sound system has this problem on XM, FM and memory stick.",neg
I just about died due to acceleration on braking.  Car thrust out into traffic when stopping at end of our street.  Others barely swerved in time crossing into opposing traffic to avoid us.  Have now read others reports of identical issues.  Sudden acceleration even when brakes applied.  Sudden deceleration with steady accelerator pressure at slower speeds.  Only 3 months with car and have had growing concern and increasing experiences with these issues.  After today's incident this car has to go back.  It is not safe.,neg
"I bought a brand new 2016 Honda Pilot EX-L.  I had the SUV for 8 months before trading it in.  The vehicle drove very well and was very comfortable - great for a growing family / large family.  I traded the Pilot in as the vehicle was frequently emitting a gas/oil odor through its front vents.  I bought the Pilot in several times for diagnostic and repairs but the dealer was unable to 'replicate' the issue and therefore did not have a resolution to the problem.  Honda stated they would no longer look at my vehicle given the inability to replicate the issue and suggested I go through arbitration if I was still unsatisfied.  I unfortunately went through the arbitration process and lost badly given Honda's experience in dealing with these matters.  Honda changed its position regarding the issue, stating it was a common issue and the car should be emitting such disgusting/hazardous fumes - noting this was not a defect, but normal.  (The change in Honda's position was a result of me getting a 3rd party mechanic to verify the issue.)  I was very disappointed with my ownership experience and have realized that companies don't care about their customers, just their bottom line (should have known!).  Also, the radio is terrible on the Pilot (I think the company is working on resolving this issue).  The touch screen doesn't have a volume button, which I didn't think would bother me, but became pretty annoying over time.",neg
"I heard a chirping sound in my car the last 2 weeks & made an appointment at the dealership.  They didn't know what it was, but thought it could be the transmission.  They put me in a rental car & called today to tell me that they have to order a whole new transmission for the car!!!  I just bought the car in October & this is such a disappointment! Do not recommend!",neg
"1) Left my wife stranded -- Put the car in reverse, foot on brake, not moving, then pressed the stop button. Car locked her out and wouldn't start. Had to mess with locks and start button for 30 minutes before the car 'reset' itself.

2) Transmission is UNSAFE! -- 9 speed can't find the right gear, car stutters, will LAUNCH you downhill. Low speed driving is terrible, can't maintain a constant speed. Seems like really bad software making gear decisions.

3) Lane assist is DANGEROUS! -- Can't help you at all, will not hold the lane. Hey Honda, either you steer or I steer, but whoever is steering better be really good at it. Steering is NOT a cooperative activity! Don't ""assist"" me with steering unless it can be trusted.

4) So many little software problems. Remembers the seat position incorrectly.

5) Worst entertainment center ever. Seems designed in 1998. Can't use the nav while moving, seriously? I can mess with the radio all day, using the most confusing and distracting software ever devised, but I can't use the nav?

6) The car 'Dings' at uss constantly and randomly. It's trying to tell us something, I have no idea what it is saying. DING .. wait a few minutes -- DING!

Who wrote the software for this car, my kids could have done a better job!",neg
"Hi All,
I have brought this vehicle in Mar 2016 and not event completed 3-months. I had the following problems with vehicle.
1. After stopping while going forward- clunk or sound of something loses- weard sound.
2. My office commute is 5-miles/day- within 5-miles yesterday i got this alert Engine temperature hot
3. Acceleration raise automatically when you are stopping in signal.
I called Honda care and going to the Dealer today and will update.

Update from Honda Customer Care: I complaint on Friday 10 Jun 2016, however i haven't received any response from them and their turn around time in 2-days.
                                                                  I got call on 14 Jun 2016 and its disconnected within 2-rings. I tried called daily 4-5 times and left voice messages no                                                    message/call back from them. I got a call on today 20 Jun 2016 after getting my car.

Service Update: There was a faulty radiator fixed in my Car by the Honda company and this made mixing of coolant/transmission fluid. Now they told that replaced the radiator and some hoses in my car.

I dont expect this after spending 50k in my car from the Honda Company. I hope this review will help you.

Thanks,",neg
"We traded in our 2011 Honda Pilot, and went for the top of the line this time. While the interior and amenities are very nice, they don't make up for the problems with the transmission.  Two months after purchasing the car we noticed a whining sound while accelerating. Took them 2 months and me being very insistent on getting a fix, which was a new wiring harness. Recently the vehicle started having transmission problems, similar to other reviews. Transmission was glitchy, lurching, missing gears, this was most notable when climbing a hill. The vehicle then started with some sort of belt squeaking noise, engine then started overheating while idling. Back to Honda Service....""somehow"" transmission fluid had gotten into the radiator, and the Honda service verified the transmission problem, the fix replacing the entire transmission. Found out at the Honda Service desk that they had to replace a transmission on another Elite just a few weeks before mine. After doing extensive research on this 9 speed transmission, it seems this transmission is not reliable. I too like other Elite owners, am EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED WITH HONDA. Why would they put this transmission in their most expensive vehicle? I have called American Honda to open a case, with the hopes of getting out of this car and into a Pilot EX-L with the tried and true 6 speed transmission. Of course the dealer with ""let"" me trade my car in and accomplish this, and then I can loose twelve grand. SHAME ON YOU HONDA!!!
Thank Goodness we were able to get out of this car...Went to an Acura dealer this December and they helped us dump this lemon of a car..I'm in an ACURA RDX and love it...this is what a car should do when you bring it home:)",neg
"I have the car for one year and the Collision Mitigation Braking System (CMBS) never did work in Stage 2 or Stage 3.
Only the warning light comes on. Brakes are never applied. Going more than 10 MPH faster than the car ahead of you, only Stage 1 comes on with a warning notice. No light braking for Stage 2. No hard braking for Stage 3. I am Emergency Vehicle Operator Course trained. I had someone who I know keep a constant speed of 30 MPH and then retested again going 50 MPH. I would approach going 10 MPH faster than the lead car and only Stage 1 warning would activate, even when I was only 10 feet away before I had to manually apply the brakes hard. Apparently Honda/Accura had an earlier issue with the CMBS falsely activating due to being too sensitive. They did a software update but now it is not activating stage 2 or stage 3. This occurs no matter what setting ( long, normal, short) you have the CMBS set to. I brought it in twice to the dealer and although the service tech test drove it and couldn't get the brakes to work the computer stated everything was fine. Honda tech line was also called by the dealer and they said if the computer said there was no errors there is nothing to do. I called Honda Corporation and they also said there was nothing that could be done. Automatic Cruise Control works so it can't be the Radar or camera. This is a 2016 Honda Pilot Elite with CMBS. UPDATE ; have brought in back to dealer 3 times and they say that the computer does not show a problem, there is nothing they can do. Even though they test drove it with me and agree the brakes never come on no matter how close you get to the vehicle in front of you",neg
"I want other owners to know that I bought a new 2016 Honda Pilot because I bought the first year 2009 Honda Pilot and drove it to 176k with no problems. I liked the old Honda and bought in to the new Honda because of the safety features and improved fuel economy. 

The bad
I can safely say after driving the fist 2,500 miles with the new Honda Pilot, this car is garbage. The fit and finish is horrible (needed to have two of the plastic panels replaced because they warped), needed to have the entire head unit taken off of the car because of an annoying noise (first 100 miles and two days in the shop), now the navigation system doesn't recognize commands, the stereo is anemic and often crackles and hisses. The only way to stop this is to turn the car on an off. So in a total of one month the car has been in the shop for a total of four days. This in comparison to the 2010 that never had an issue. 

The good
The safety features are great. The lane departure, lane assist, adaptive cruise and front end collision all work great. The econ also works great as I am consistently getting 30 mpg combined city and highway. That being said those are the pluses.",neg
"I am continually frustrated with my new Honda Pilot, and want to share a brief glimpse into my experience in case it can help someone else…

Electronics:
-imagine computers in the '90s …
-imagine IT department back then ... turn it on/off, and if that doesn't fix it, ""that's the way its supposed to work""
-I have gone to dealer numerous times with a typed list 2-3 pages long of all the issues.  Yes, most are just annoying things, like feeling a $5 radio from Walmart wouldn't have the same intermittent reception issues, or that the navigation on my phone (pick any app!) is 10x better, or the audio for the bluray play just stops working for a couple days every now and then, or that I sometimes have to turn the Pilot off/on to adjust the temperature controls, or that sometimes things just randomly stop working for a while (and then magically work again … and then not …), etc.
-the dealer people are nice and mean well, and yes they have had some updates that seemed to fix much of the issues, but not all, and other issues come back after awhile
-SERIOUS: situations where Pilot could have caused an accident
  1) while turning onto a busy street, my vehicle 100% on its own, went into neutral and the engine revved all the way up, then a second later it was back in Drive, and fortunately the accelerator was not still all the way down on its own 
  2) car slammed on the brakes, 100% on its own (and I mean slammed, screeching tires, everything in the car going flying), stopping me ~30’ from where a car in front of me had been slowly turning off the road into a parking lot.  The thought of self braking is great, but even if the turning car had stopped, worst case a small corner would have been sticking in the road and I would have slowed down/around, or even had plenty of time/room to stop.  

Other examples: 
-cup holders in front are made for Big Gulps, so every other drink container bounces around, so my whole middle console is covered with coffee/other stains
-front storage is just one monster tub (old Pilots had compartments that let you organize space)
-rear seats do not lean back 1/3 as much as in previous Pilots (so kids can't sleep as easily)
-had to replace all 4 tires after just ~19,000 miles
-stainless steel running boards have rusting screws/or other fastener behind them that are constantly leaking rust out; and because “elbow grease” can remove the leaking rust from the stainless steel, its not a warranty issue (we just need to apply “elbow grease” after it rains every time)
-maintenance plan is basically bring it in, and we’ll let you know what’s needed
-engine always sounds like its short a few quarts of oil
-at random times (independent of outside humidity or dryness) all of the windows will fog up, and I need to blast the defroster
-and a laundry list of other annoyances

Are there a lot of good to great things about the new Pilot – Yes, absolutely.  But I have never had a vehicle that had so many issues and annoyances.  I previously owned an older Honda Pilot and LOVED it!  Had I known what the new Pilot is like, I would have rather kept my old model and put $40K into it!!  I have looked into the lemon laws, but all of the problem above are generally intermittent, and can be rationalized away as subjective opinion (“that’s the way its supposed to work”)

For what its worth!",neg
"I bought the 2016 Elite in December and right off we had transmission problems.  Lots of jerking at low speeds.  The dealer flushed the transmission and that went away...for right now.  My idle stop stopped working also and dealer said it was fixed..2 days later it stopped working.  A week after the idle stop was ""fixed"" my check engine light comes on.  Dealer said it was probably just a loose gas cap.  They obviously don't know a thing about their vehicles.  The pilot doesn't come with a gas cap.  So, now the dealer has it for idle stop not working, engine light, remote start-sometimes it will start, sometimes it wont.  If it does remote start then the seat warmers don't work.  You have to shut the engine off and restart then they will work.  I've owned 4 other Pilots and I've never had a problem.  I will be contacting Honda Corporation today.  Hopefully this will be resolved.  

Well it's been almost a year and we still have transmission problems.  We were told by the Honda Service Dept that there is no fix for the really bad jerking when going up steep hills at a low speed.  When I first made this review I had not driven up in the mountains or any steep hills.  All the other non transmission problems seem to be resolved when they replaced the motherboard.  I do get different errors that pop up once in awhile and then they go away.  I try to take pictures of them when I can.",neg
"I purchased my 2016 Honda Pilot in September of 2015. I was fairly happy with the purchase, but I did notice some unusual transmission experiences. Well this week, it got worse. The gears banged into place and made loud noises. Sometimes it would not shift and just stay in gear with the engine revving really high and then banging into the next gear.

The problem? The cooling coil in the transmission failed causing anti-freeze and trans fluid to mix throughout the transmission and the cooling system. According to the dealership, this is the third one they've seen like this in their shop. They also told me that their friends who work at the Acura dealer nearby are having the exact same issue with the MDX. They are going to replace my transmission and flush the cooling system. The car has 18,000 miles on it.",neg
"In two months front window jammed. Dealer fixed the window. However, all dors have plastic lining at the bottom. Now those plastic linining peels off. It looks like falling apart.",neg
"We had the same issues with the 9 Speed transmission.  Honda advised there was a software upgrade to address the problem so we made an appointment.  The day before the appointment, the car overheated.  Problem was the transmission cooler leaked coolant into the transmission.  Honda is now installing a new transmission and flushing the cooling system.  According to the mechanic, there have been other instances where coolant was slowly leaking into the transmission.  So we'll see what happens.  Honda installed a new transmission under warranty.  However, when I asked if the new transmission was improved to eliminate the defects leading to the transmission failure, the Honda service department could not guarantee that the new transmission would not have the same failure in the future.  Since the manufacturer warranty on the Pilot is only 60K miles, we purchased an extended warrantee (100K Miles).  The new transmission does not shift smoothly and we'll need to have this diagnosed by Honda during our next service.",neg
"Purchased 2016 Honda Pilot Elite in September, 2015 and now has 6,700 miles on it.  The auto-idle quits working and I have had it in for repair 4 times.  The last two times I have been told that the system thinks my battery is low but when the battery is checked I am told it is excellent.  They then have to reset it and it then works fine for a short while.  Dealer said they cannot do anything about it until Honda does a software upgrade to fix the problem.",neg
"This car has a radio issue that has yet to be addressed by Honda.  It crackles, fades, and volume fluctuates.  It seems to go in and out of mono and stereo on a radio station that is right down the street from me.  The speedometer is too high on the dash and from my seating position I can only view it when I look under the top of the steering wheel.",neg
Beware of the elite and touring 9 speed models. The transmission is terrible. It actually speeds up going down hills. We thought this was a flaw just in our car yet many others have experienced the same problems. It is dangerous and my wife is afraid to drive it anymore. Our $44000 pilot has sat in the shop for a total of 28 days thus far. Honda corporate won't admit that there is a problem although our local dealer admits it is. So much for Honda quality. We are selling ASAP.,neg
First off I was told Android auto would work with the 2016 Honda pilot which was not true and secondly the FM radio fades in and out constantly no matter what frequency that you have it on.  Its no reception issue.  Its not the speed value control.  I have taking back to the dealer twice and they cant do anything until Honda Corporation figure it out?,neg
"I bought this 2016 Honda Pilot with around 100 miles on it. Almost after day one when you go to four way stop with foot off gas on on break it will take you into the intersection. This has happened too many times. The dealer would not comment on emails until I lowered their rating on dearerrater.com
I took to a. Different dealer to check out three times. The touch screen radio also locks up.  Tech said radio, breaks and gas to engine are all controlled by computer. It is thought to be throttle body censor and computer.
I called American Honda customer sevice and they said checking into it. Reported to  federal government safety agency, attorney general. Many with same issue online. This dealer may have too much knowable about auto before selling + not disclose anything.",neg
"I have owned Honda's all my life. This is my 5th Honda, and it will be my last. Words cannot describe how frustrated and disappointed I am with this vehicle. I test drove the lower level version and thought it was great, but it was a huge mistake to upgrade to the Touring. That infotainment system is a joke. I've almost gotten in accidents just trying to use it. Attempting to control the music/volume is a nightmare. Oh, and when we're using maps the passenger has absolutely no control over the music. The 9-speed transmission is terrible. I feel like my neck hurts after driving because all of the jerking around. I am constantly fighting with this car to be in control. God forbid I have to do something quickly, like get around a stopped car with traffic coming, because the car doesn't react quickly to my foot. I despise this car, and we have it for sale, though no doubt will lose a ton of money on it. I'm so glad we're not the only ones having issues. We have registered the complaint with Honda Motor, and have brought it back to dealership a few times, but they are mostly dismissive of our concerns.",neg
"The Pilot looks great on paper and in pictures, but don't be fooled.  The specs are good and it looks good in photos as most vehicles do however the reality is much different.  While fuel economy and engine performance are good, those seem to be the only things that don't disappoint.  But to get straight to the point, here are problems that I've noticed:

1.  The infotainment is a really terrible system.  It is underpowered, unrefined, unintuitive and cumbersome.  It is really slow and unresponsive, probably because of outdated/cheap components used to power the system.  Every tap lags, every single one.  The interface is also very unintuitive, common features such as playlists, albums, genres are buried multiple menu layers deep.  When you plug in your device, it defaults to playing your entire library of songs alphabetically.  I get random error messages that cause the audio or navigation to close on a fairly regular basis of about once a week.  An error message will just pop up and close the current app.

2.  The navigation, probably in part to being underpowered, has been terrible so far.  I've only used it a few times so far but each time is has incorrectly calibrated my location and it would take a few minutes of driving for it to properly recalibrate my location.  I've driven and used many vehicles with navigation and this is honestly the first time it's ever happened, on each occasion. 

3.  The radio is complete junk.  It sounds like listening to a 30 year old clock radio because the reception is so bad.  Sound is constantly fading, crackling or has static.  There has been speculation that this is something that has only impacted a few Pilots however I am convinced this is a design defect.  The antennas on the Pilot are similar to the antennas on the iPhone 4 and consist of bands on the rear windows.  What's worse is that despite this being an issue since the release of the 2016 Pilot, there has been no official response or acknowledgment from Honda yet.

4.  Because the radio is so bad on the Pilot, most people such as myself will often listen to the music on my device.  There is nothing wrong with the sound system itself, just the reception.  However, since the infotainment system is so incredibly bad, even trying to listen to the music on my device is a major pain.

5.  The footwell heat simply doesn't work well.  It seems like a minor issue until you have consecutive single digit degree weather and realize only a very small portion of the area above your ankles are warm.  The footwell area never completely warms, no matter how high you set the temperature or how high the fan is.  Your lower legs will always be cold, or at least mine have.  

6.  For the trims below Touring with the 6 speed, the shifter is so poorly and terribly designed, it looks like it came out of a 1990 Corolla.

Above all, my impression of the 2016 Pilot is that it was severely rushed and a lot of cost cutting was involved.  There really is no excuse for the radio to have such horrible reception in this day and age.  The infotainment system is clearly the result of cost cutting as its so terrible.  The main benefit of the Pilot is the engine performance.  I highly recommend anyone considering the Pilot to take it on an extended test drive and really pay close attention to the radio and tinker with the infotainment.  Drive it back to back with any other vehicle and I'm certain most will recognize a clear difference in radio quality.  However, if literally none of these things matter, than the Pilot may be a good choice, otherwise I would at least hold off until the 2017 models arrive before even considering one.",neg
"I mean no disrespect to the '86 Blazer.  It was a good value. The cheap seat material, sea of cheap plastic, and lack of features do not equal a $32,000 car, Honda.",neg
"Wait another year until they figure out the quirks.  There are some serious issues with the 9 speed transmission as well as a creaking issue the car has been back to the dealer for twice.  

I wanted so much to love this SUV but unfortunately there are some serious issues with the vehicle
-Honda Engineering know about the creaking
-The transmission accelerates when you are slowing (What the heck?) 
- Technology (radio) is very buggy - We have the Tech package. 
-Poor design when third row is folded - there is a big gap that makes loading difficult
- No third row floor mat? Really, even on the touring? 

I paid 40K plus for a vehicle and I am treated as if I just walked off the street.  I should have purchased the Infiniti!

Don't pay $36000 for a car that does not function like a new car and the manufacturer does not care enough to fix the problem.",neg
"Read up on the 9 speed transmission in the touring and elite models.  Acura has a TSB supposedly addressing these but none has been release for Pilot, which is frustrating since they are the same transmission.  Low gears are ""jerky"", acceleration when stopping (DANGEROUS!)  The radio; plain and simple, AWFUL.   The fade that is all over the forums for FM is absolutely ridiculous.  Reminds me of a ""jambox"" from back in the day that had old batteries - sound fades in and out.  Many on the forums have said Honda has stated it has to do with cycling back and forth between stereo and mono; really Honda.  In a 40+K car in 2016 you have issues with FM???!!  First Honda I've owned and unless they get these issues corrected quickly, definitely my last.  Very disappointed so far.",neg
"I purchased my 2016 Honda Pilot in September 2015 and did not notice transmission issues or temperature issues at first but they have steadily increased over the months.  I now have owned it for almost 5 months and have brought it in to be serviced twice due to transmission and temperature gauge issues.  I am so disappointed with the lack of support from Honda regarding their transmission issues.  My Pilot does not accelerate properly, in fact I have to push hard on the pedal for it to accelerate and it shifts at the incorrect times and causes me major issues when driving up hill or on the interstate.  My local Honda dealer had a tech drive it and he said he felt the issue but could not fix it since the ""computer"" found no issue with the transmission.  That is completely unacceptable.  

I am also having issues with my Pilot not properly warming up on cooler days and the heated seats are a joke.  The heated seats do not warm up properly and the temperature is no different for the Low or High setting.  Again, this was reviewed by my local Honda dealer but was told once again that they could not fix it because the ""computer"" could not find anything wrong.  Again, unacceptable. 

I now have another appointment scheduled next week to have my cruise control fixed since that has now stopped working as well.  

I plan to turn in my Pilot next month if all of my issues cannot be resolved.",neg
"The good:  Safety features, interior space / cargo volume, engine power
The bad:  Infotainment is slow and buggy, floaty handling.
The ugly:  Honda quality (or lack there of).  Jerky 9 speed transmission that ""surges"" in certain down hill driving conditions - Safety issue!  The vehicle has a highway vibration issue that the dealer can't figure out.  Honda could care lees and claims it's ""normal"". Paint quality - my dealer bought back the first one we purchased from them because of 30+ ""spots"" in the clear coat.  Honda was going to pay to have 75% of the vehicle repainted, but we refused.   The first vehicle didn't have the vibration problem and still Honda tells us they all do it, so it's a ""normal characteristic of the vehicle.""  I'm guessing it's VCM related, but It's hard to say when Honda wont help.  We had ""normal"" vibration issues on both a 2009 and 2012 and both ended up requiring engine work at under 70k miles.  Should have known better.",neg
"I test drove the 2016 pilot lx awd. There is no headroom for someone 6'1"" or taller. The EX has power front seats but even then you find yourself looking at the visor. I have a 2014 CR-V and I can see the sky. Both have decent headroom the problem is the design of the 2016 Pilot leaves you looking right at the visor. Wow, and I wanted to buy one. It is a problem they decided to overlook. I guess I am leaving Honda because I want and need (towing) the midsize suv.",neg
"Gripe review.
This $40K vehicle is not what the quality or integrity I thought I was getting. I have only purchased Honda's for the past 25 years and am sad to say this is my last. 

Everything about the car was what we expected except that we never used the radio when we test drove it. Once we literally pulled it off the lot and started to listen to the FM stereo we noticed it had an issue. The sound quality was poor. It's volume would go up and down on its own and sounded muffled. I brought it to dealer and make the long story short it's a known defect with my dealer and AHC. BTW - currently there is NO FIX and no ETA.

Here's my question that Honda cannot answer. If this vehicle has all these safety features (Sensing) how can I trust that it even works when I need it when they can't make a basic FM radio?",neg
"Owner of a 2014 (and past 2004) Pilots...lease is coming up next year on the '14 so asked my sales manager bud if I could keep a '16 for a number of days. Long relationship and I've bought 7 other Acura's/Honda's from him - it does pay to stay loyal! In short, I'm not going to get one. Appearance - looks like a CRV on steroids or any of the other mid-SUV's out there. I've also shun Acura until they get over their ""the gaudier the better"" styling philosophy. Yes, it does drive and feels more solid on the road vs. the '14; however road noise, ever the Achilles Heel of anything this corporation produces, is still omnipresent. My '02 GMC pickup is still quieter! The interior gets a 10 for overall styling and material improvements, a 7 for an over-busy dash/electronics (Consumer Reports just hammered Honda for their e-systems), a 1 for making the driver area ""tighter"" in both height and width, and a -6 for removing the high-center console and replacing with those el-cheapo arm rests from their parts bin.

So, overall I'm disappointed with their efforts here - and I note here are not many glowing reviews on this and other boards. My dealership buddy says reception has been lukewarm with a number of people saying it's more like an ""Odyssey with a longer snout"". Hopefully Honda will hear some of these words and make further refinements. They finally did revise the Civic following an outpouring of criticism.

Happy New Year!",neg
"After 6 weeks of driving the Honda Pilot Elite, I have a growing concern that the user interface to the electronics package may be a safety concern for drivers.  I am very confident that Honda builds a safe vehicle in terms of physical structure, air bags and collision avoidance technology, but there is a ""huge"" distraction issue with the center stack of electronics (nav, audio, RES, cell phone).  My concern is the drive must spend an inordinate amount of time interacting with the center stack touch screen.  Is is very cumbersome and has many layers to accomplish simple tasks.  To make it worse, after several touches on the screen, the finger prints show and if the sun hits the screen a certain way, you cannot see or read the information on the screen.  I spend way too much time interacting with the screen when voice commands would accomplish the same thing in a more efficient and ""safe"" manor.  The same principle applies to the RES (rear entertainment system).  In order to play a DVD for a child, you must put the DVD in the center console, stop the vehicle, get in the back seat and use the rear control remote to start the movie playing.  You cannot do this from the ""Rear Audio"" screen that shows on the center console.  How inconvenient and dangerous (stopping on the side of an interstate highway) is this?  What little voice activation has been provided by Honda is really useless.  It is very slow and you usually end up using the touch screen which is not organized very well.  I am really shocked at how little effort was put into the design of the electronics package.  Again, this is a very ""unsafe"" system given the amount of time and effort the drive must expend at the expense of paying attention to the road!",neg
I really want to enjoy my 2016 Honda Pilot but I cannot ignore the fact that my car shutters at 35/45 MPH and jolts during deceleration. My local Honda Dealership said they found wrong with it and it might be normal car characteristics. That sounds like a cop-out up for a terribly made car... Very disappointing!,neg
"I drove around a CRV and loved it which was why I didn't spend much time researching when I traded in my 2015 GMC Crew Cab for the 2016 Pilot (I put a ton of miles on my vehicles so I trade them in before I hit 30k) I miss that truck dearly loved loved it!!! ... Anyway the first major problem I can't handle is the blue tooth ... It is terrible!!! I can't hold a conversation with anyone because they can't hear me and vise versa. According to them there is a ton of background noise I either have to pull over or take them off Bluetooth. 2nd the stereo is sub standard. My 2013 Kia Sportage was superior to this stereo system and that car was half this price. 3rd) the touch screen is VERY sensitive and I'm always pressing too close to another option and it goes to something else (hard to explain) but I NEVER had any problem with my GMc touch screen. It also just seems too busy oh and fingerprints are a terrible issue!! In the gleam of the light sometimes I can't even see behind them (and I clean it all the time.. Because I have to 😉) Also, the third row isn't easy to put down and up. The system seems antiquated and cumbersome. THIS VEHICLE IS VERY SLOW. Even when I take the Econ option off its very slow. It drives like a van and you sit like your in a van (I've driven a Nissan Quest and it was more 'fun' than driving this) so if you have back problems I advise you truly test it out for awhile. If I drive it for over an hour my psyatic nerve starts to bother me. I'm 5'7"" and weigh 135.  also, it's not as quiet of a ride as I expected. My truck was quieter and so was my Kia. Honestly the only thing about it that's a plus is the gas mileage. I average 22.4mpg. But that's the only plus and over everything else I would pay the gas difference in a heart beat to drive an expedition again. (I've driven them too) I hope this helps, everyone is different but I've heard that there have been a lot of bad reviews of this vehicle and I'm sure Honda will iron them out for the next years model or at least I hope so!! I will be trading this one in asap and its to the point I don't care how much money I loose in doing so. 😢 I also advise against the grey leather... My jeans stain it and I'm having to clean the leather every weak Bc it shows wear very quickly.",neg
"Former owner 2005 pilot my wife loved 2005 pilot and took better than excellent care of it Honda offered a offensive  trade in value of $5000 on a new 2016 pilot, even after bring offended with trade in offer and because my wife liked the pilot we had for over 11 years I went ahead and bought the 2016 pilot and gave the 2005 pilot to my daughter. I knew the 2016 pilot was not equipped as well as most other makes in same price range, what didn't know was how poor the quality and function of included equipment is! Interior so called leather looks like cheap plastics, hands free phone system is a joke you can't understand what callers are saying, Honda put in new microphone (didn't help) would like to disable system so it won't interfere with cell phone,back seat entertainment is so difficult for children to use and requires someone in front to help, the kids use iPad instead, also there is no connection in back seat to recharge iPad has to be connected at front seat, Car is under powered if you use fuel economy feature, the only real complaint I had with 2005 pilot was road noise 2016 pilot is little or no better 11 years later, weather striping around doors is as flimsy and cheep as I have ever seen.

Buyers beware: Purchased AWD EX-L model two weeks ago. Noticed oil on garage floor. Oil leaking from rear differential (AWD model).

"Frustrating is the only word I can use to describe my experience with my brand new 2016 Honda Pilot. I don’t know if it was a freak occurrence or maybe I’m just unlucky, but I drove my Pilot off the lot and about 10 miles later the Touch Screen Infotainment system just stopped working. I was ok with that honestly, things break, car manufacturing isn't a perfect process. However the thing that is unforgivable and what warrants a 1 star review for my brand new car is the face that getting Honda to repair it has been an absolute clown show. I’ve owned the car for 25 days and I’ve only had the car to drive for 5 days because the last 17 days the car has been in the shop. So here follow my timeline and make your own decision about whether or not buying a new Honda Pilot is right for you.

Day 1: I bought the car and drove it away. The sales process was clean and efficient. I drove 10 miles home and on the way my infotainment touch screen started fading to black.

Day 2: Driving the car around town the infotainment screen just stopped functioning entirely. Just a black screen that would show lines. Made an appointment to get the car in the shop the next day.

Day 3: After staying at the dealership for 3 hours Honda told me their computers found nothing wrong, and that I should leave the car there and take a loaner while they called Honda Tech support to figure out the issue. This wasn’t immediately possible as I was planning an out of state trip that weekend so I said I would bring it right back on Monday.

Day 7: After driving the car all weekend the infotainment system never worked once. It’s a blessing that I could control the radio was from the buttons on the steering wheel. I took the car into the dealership, and drove away with my loaner. All in all I had put about 780 miles on the car (150 miles of which was driving it back and forth to the dealership) They told me they hope to have it fixed in “a few days”. Great.

Day 10: Haven’t heard back from the dealership so I give them a call. The tech line said they should just replace the entire infotainment system, it’s on order and they should have the part some time this week. They hope to get me the car in “a few days”. Great.

Day 14: The part didn’t come over the weekend. We’re investigating why the part order didn’t go through. We’ll get this cleared up and get the car back to you as soon as we can. At this point Honda has had my car longer than I have. We’re starting to get really upset so we call Honda of America Corporate to see what's the problem. They said the dealership should figure it out and there is nothing they could do about it. They gave us a case number incase there was a problem.

Day 16: We’ve ordered the part but it’s on hold. They won’t release it to us yet. At this point we’re wondering if the part even exists. This is where we start pulling our hair out from frustration.

Day 17: I get a call from manager for my region at Honda Corporate. He seems just as upset as I am at how this has been handled and assures me that he understands my frustration. He say’s he’ll talk to my dealership's service manager and get the part shipping expedited. He says he’s going to investigate and crack skulls and call me the following Monday Day 21.

Day 22: The regional manager from Honda of America calls me back and tells me the part still hasn’t been ordered. That he’ll call me back with an update later this week. 

This is today. At this point all I feel is silent rage. The car was fun to drive, the features were amazing but how can I feel excited at this point. My brand new car that I paid for now just feels like it's a refurbished lemon. We’ve been given nothing but the run around by Honda and NOTHING has been done. THEY HAVEN’T EVEN ORDERED A REPLACEMENT PART SUCCESSFULLY. I’m exhausted. This was the first new car I’ve ever purchased. It’s been in the shop for 17 days and at this point I hope they keep the car in the shop another 10 days so they will be forced to replace or buy it back via the lemon law. It’s just been a customer service catastrophy so buyer beware and pray if your Pilot breaks that the replacement part actually exists.",neg
"After having 2010 Pilot Touring we have been waiting for this to come out. With the excitement of it we bought it soon after dealership received them. We noticed the different feel of the transmission from the start but the salesman said they use this same transmission in the Acura's so I thought it was normal and would adapt to our driving habits. But after owning it for a couple months it never did adapt but actually got worse. I had the vehicle looked at to see if there was a new update for the transmission but they said it is normal. I cant believe Acura owners would accept a transmission like this. Needless to say this will be the last Pilot I ever own, looking at trading it in on a Toyota as my wife and I hate this car.",neg
"The Honda from hell. Bought a 2016 Honda Pilot Touring. Picked up my new SUV from Morristown Honda and took it on a road trip the next day. It  failed me three times on a road trip with computer issues to So Fla. The power steering wouldn't work along with other issues on the dash board. Needless to say, It was left at the dealership in South Fla the following morning. After 12 days left the vehicle in So Fla. It's now day 25 without my new  vehicle. Have requested another vehicle since it never worked safely the day after purchase. Honda Motors and Morristown Honda have only just given me lip service on that issue. They plan to ship it to me when repaired. Today I heard from the service department of the So Fla dealership and informed me the part has come in and if the SURGERY goes well I will get a call back. Never happened. Shame on Honda Motors for not stepping up to the plate and get me a replacement Pilot.",neg
"The 2016 Honda Pilot is almost a perfect car except that it has major, major transmission problems that aren't readily evident in just a test drive.  We just purchased a 2016 Honda Elite and the transmission really is a mess.  It can't find gears correctly, when on a downhill and you brake the car actually speeds up because it upshifts while you are braking, there are head-jerking episodes that are unexplained, when trying to climb hills it downshifts so much that you actually fight the car to try to get it up the hill.  We are so disappointed I can't even tell you.  We paid $51,000 for this car at a Honda dealer in Northern Virginia and it only has 265 miles on it and my wife refuses to drive it anymore.  She was in tears at the dealership and they, so far, have taken no ownership of the problem.  By the way, if you think that this is just us then go and look at other reviews on forums for the Pilots on the Internet. It is known that the 9 speed has a real problem.  Honda does not seem to be addressing this which is shocking given that it is happening on the 2 highest end models -- Touring and Elite.  But I'm getting the feeling that they don't care or don't know how to fix it.  With literally just 265 miles on the car we have listed it for sale.  We are going to take a major loss on this car and get rid of it right away.  I have nothing but the worst feelings about Honda as a company and brand.  Do not buy this car.  Do not buy this car.",neg
"This is our 3rd Honda Pilot Touring. We jumped on this as soon as they came out. Big mistake! The car is nice except the loud engine noise while idling and the 9 speed transmission. I have taken this in twice to see if it is a problem but it's how it's supposed to be. Slow speed shifting is horrible, very jumpy and your neck goes back and forth trying to accelerate. It's so bad I actually have the car up for sale after 2 months of owning it. This will be the last Honda I will own for a very long time.
My suggestion is if you like the car get the 6 speed automatic and skip the 9 speed.",neg
"Honda dealers don't yet have the tires for this vehicle in stock! Our touring has been running on the ""doughnut"" spare for a week now. The dealer ordered the tire and told us it would be here in a week. They just called and told us that it will be another week due to ""backordered"" or some foolishness. This will make 2 weeks my wife has had to ride on this cheap spare...not really comfortable with that. They choose a tire that NO ONE carries, dealers or locally. Seriously no one can get tires for this vehicle without ordering. Our dealer Moss Motors has been less than helpful, not even bothering to return a call as promised. Come on Honda! Regretting our new vehicle choice at the moment.",neg
"Strike 1- Styling, It simply looks like every other vehicle on the road. The interior is more of a mini van than SUV. There is no center arm rest or large storage area as in previous Pilots. It has mini van style arm rests.  Strike 2 - Too much unnecessary electronics such as the touch screen audio, push button start and electric tailgate.  (Are people really that lazy that they can not open and close the tailgate)  Strike 3 - Handling. This vehicle does not handle well. The steering is light and does not seem strong enough for a vehicle this size and weight. There is also a weird bottom weight feel. Out here in the country where I live, we have lots of winding roads. I have never had any car or truck handle so poorly and with so much body roll. There is no confidence when driving.  In my opinion, Honda has taken several steps backwards with the 2016 Pilot. It is not an improvement from the last 2 generations.",neg
We just brought this car last month 7/1/2015 and already I'm started to hear a weird squeak noise after i start the engine.  At first I thought it was because I left the car for couple of days without using it but is not the case.  It's happening quite frequently now.   I go in press the brake then the start button and the engine comes on and then a squeak noise.  Please let me know if anyone else is having this issue.  I will take this in and see what is going on.  Thanks,neg
"Our family has leased a new Honda Pilot every 3 years since 2003.Our current lease is up and we went to get a new Pilot. Needless to say, we did not like the redesigned Pilot. Don’t get me wrong, there were a lot of improvements to the new Pilot, but the overall style is more of a minivan than an SUV. The quality of materials is significantly better than our current 2012 Pilot and we like the captain chairs. The one button to move the middle seats is very easy and the camera in the passenger side mirror is very cool!  The ventilated front seats are comfortable.  What we did not care for is the minivan style flip down arm rests on the front seats and touch screen audio system. You can see every finger print on the screen. Our Acura also has the touch screen audio and the fingerprints never go away. It drives me crazy! The touch screen is bit more labor intensive to change the station or volume, so you will be more distracted from the road and traffic. There are controls on the steering wheel for some functions though.  Our Acura also has push button start and both my husband and I would prefer an actual key.  It is very easy to leave the car running, especially how quiet cars are today. The push button transmission selector is in a really bad location. I have visions of a beverage mishap and a very expensive repair to follow. Why the transmission selector is electronic and not mechanical is also a concern. The visibility is very good from the driver’s seat and the ride is awesome. The engine start-stop is something I would have to get used to, although. I really don’t see the saving as the mpg is rated the same as what we get in our 2012 Pilot.  The steering and handling on the new Pilot is a huge disappointment.  The steering is weak with a weird bottom heavy feel and it is slow to respond. The steering does not feel substantial enough to handle a vehicle of that size and weight.  Needless to say it is very unnatural and not something I would want to deal with every day.  The new Pilot has significant body roll on right hand turns, but seemed to be Ok turning left. If you take your turns at a snail’s pace, it might not roll as much.  I am also not fond of the exterior styling. It screams “Me To” as it looks like an expanded CRV.  We have been driving Honda’s and Acura’s for a very long time and have been satisfied and loyal customers, we are now looking at other manufacturers for our next SUV.",neg
"The redesigned Pilot is more of a minivan than an SUV. Just sitting behind the wheel makes you feel like your in a minivan with the lack of a center console and flimsy fold down arm rests. The quality of the materials is very good, however it does not drive well. The ride is  very smooth, but the steering is very light and does not feel stable. There is a heavy bottom weighted feel that is very weird and unnatural. You really can not feel the road at all. The lane watch feature and the back up camera are welcomed safety features, however the touch screen display is just annoying and is cumbersome to operate. I personally do not like it, nor do I care for the push button start. These are not welcomed features. The one touch seat decline/ movement is a nice feature, but more money and engineering should have gone into the steering and handling to make this a better handling vehicle. Sadly, the salesman told me very few people that have driven the new Pilot have liked the way it handled. I am not sure what Honda was thinking, but they need to go back to the drawing board on this.",neg
"Purchased a Honda Pilot 4WD Touring back in 2016 at a Honda dealer, comes with 9,000 miles, certificate used car etc. Was running great, then after a trip, humming noises and vibrations happened. Took back to Honda dealer, got the bearing replaced, also tires replaced due to uneven worn out in one side. Even that it still under warranty (< 36,000 miles). The bearing failure seemed a common problem for all Honda vehicles. I owned another vehicle i.e Honda Accord 2010, it's also had a bearing failure after 60,000 miles, and had to pay to repair. There may be a design problem, which is weight balancing is one side heavier than the other,  and that caused one side bearing worn out faster than other side.",neg
"It's mostly good but there is a major problem with the turbo engine.   Fuel is getting into the oil.   Apparently it's been a problem from 2016 to 2018 models.  Yet, there is no fix available .  I am hopeful Honda will fix the problem soon.   Until then, I cannot recommend this vehicle to others.",neg
"I purchased my 2018 CRV new.  I have had nothing but issues with the heat and defrost functions.  I took it back to the dealer four times already and their standard response is that is just the way new cars are now, they don't produce heat.  I have even purchased a thermostat for the interior because there is just no heat.  The ONLY way I can get the stupid car to heat is if I drive it longer than 40 minutes, then it finally starts to warm up around 70.  The windshield is a nightmare, the defrost does not keep it clean of snow and ice.  In this area of Wisconsin, that is a necessity, not an option.  Either I missed this, or the reviews by Consumer Reports and Edmonds are not reporting this defect.  Shame on you, as had I know this, I would never have purchased this car.  I can't say enough negative about Honda and the CR-V.",neg
"I am really upset on 2018 CRV Touring. Before buying I did test drive for about 2-5 miles and everything was ok. But after driving car about 50Miles, started to hear very loud noise like a drum noise/rattling noise. This noise is specific to Touring model as stated by dealer. If I knew at the beginning why I am going to spend $35K for a car. Now I have to live with that noise. I strongly advise to new buyers do not buy touring at all. Heres is the link for recorded video:https://youtu.be/6oxQjXOQRVo",neg
"I've put 200 miles on this vehicle and hate it. It beeps at me all the time and usually I have no idea why. Sensing system goes into error. Dash tells me to BRAKE and more BEEPING when there is nobody near me on the freeway. Fancy iPad mounted to the dash blows. The vehicle is always locked when I think it's unlocked and unlocked when I think it's locked. The locks are downright infuriating. The fab weighs about 10 pounds in your pocket. Engine is loud and s l o w. Cab is horribly loud in the rain. Thought I needed to bond with her and spent the last two days dolling her up. It made me hate the vehicle even more. It's a detailing nightmare with so many water retaining nooks and crannies. Water gets inside the tail lights. Chrome trim pieces in the headlights grab my wash mit because they are poking out at the ends. Oh, and you have to leave your fab well away from the car when washing otherwise it keeps locking the doors and beeping every time the water hits the door handles. I hate this vehicle!

Update 03-04-2018: 2 months ownership, 842 miles driven on it, no regrets about anything my previous review said. My CRV has officially been named Spawn of Satan (SOS). I especially enjoyed the 4-week insect infestation on the EXTERIOR of the vehicle. 10s of thousands of the smallest jumping insects I have ever seen. Corporate Honda did not care; dealer had no clue what to do. Best guess is that it was sold to me with a nest in it somewhere. Every ""safety"" feature that can be disabled, except for blind spot warning, has been turned off because they flat out don't work. Unfortunately, the Honda Sensing system cannot be disabled. It's not ready for market. Count on plenty of temper tantrums from the system in anything less than perfect road conditions or weather. 

A few adds to my list of dislikes...The left 2-3 inches of the front windshield becomes unusable in the rain. You cannot stuff the center storage console with stuff AND expect to use the power/USB ports. There are no lights on the joysticks. When using turn signals you can EASILY accidentally turn on high beams. If you own it, you know these things. Regardless of an obscene amount of gasketing on this vehicle, there is still a moisture issue as evidenced by inside foggy windows every time the car is washed or in rain. 

This vehicle very surprisingly topped my most despised vehicle ever owned list in about a week. It took out long standing champ '89 Chevy Beretta which GM bought back from me under lemon law. Not in a million years would I expect a Honda to do that! I want to be clear that this vehicle has had NO mechanical problems that have left me stranded.  It's the rest of it that is absolutely sub-par.  This CRV replaces a 10-year old similar size and trim level SUV with an American badge. The bar to beat didn't seem very high, but I guess it was.",neg
"My husband traded my honda pilot for this piece of crap 2018 crv. If you wan t to drive a 1999 car, then buy this. no storage space in the back every thing is just going to fly around or you have to put the thing were your tire goes. camera suck if u use it u will hit something this camera show thing s are far away when they are really close, and it's blurry.

"I scheduled an appointment to complete the paperwork and take delivery of the car. After waiting for 5 hours I was given a 2017 Pilot as a free loaner and told to go home and return the next morning for my car. When I slid into the seat, it felt goooood!  About the only adjustment I had to make was to comfortably reach the pedals. The wife was similarly comfortable in the passenger seat. It was also a pleasure to drive, accelerating easily and shifting smoothly. The next morning I picked up my new car and headed home. I spent a good part of the time trying to find a comfortable position with the seat. It is smaller with a short cushion and large bolsters top and bottom. The front of the seat cushion was digging into my leg, so I tried to adjust it lower. The seat accomplishes that by raising the back which also moves you closer to the steering wheel. Now from that position it can't slide back.  So my hair is brushing the headliner, thanks to the moon roof that is standard, and I'm closer to the wheel than I like to be without an extreme recline.  I suppose I'll get used to it, but it is very disappointing to find such a poor seat in Honda's most popular car. It will never be a ""oh, that feels good"" experience. Even the steering wheel is uncomfortable being a hard plastic. Probably the Pilot's was wrapped in leather or cushioned. The center console in the Pilot was excellent. It is a low, flat, surface providing a nice open feeling in the cabin as well as the perfect place to plop a pocketbook. The armrests are on the seat and can be left up out of the way or lowerd down to a perfect position. The CR-V has a center console that is split level, leaving not much room for anything. Also there are no slots or small drawers anywhere in the dash for small items. Everything must be thrown into the center console. When accelerating, the CR -V engine has an initial hesitation and a strained growl. The Pilot responds quickly and easily with no strain. Of course the Pilot is larger and more expensive, but it might be worth the extra investment.",neg
"On February 23, 2018, my car which has 5500 miles on it, started making a horrible noise and began losing power while on the highway.  The noise continued throughout the weekend.  We made an appointment with dealership immediately.  Honda Corporate and the Service Manager determined through video chats and conference calls that the cams were destroyed in my engine.  They believe this had to do with fuel and oil mixing and getting into the engine.  
Honda Corporate (800-999-1009) requested that dealership replace the Head of the Engine.  They have no fix for the problem with the fuel and oil mixing and destroying the engine.  The Service Manager said because the government is involved due to emissions, this issue will be continuing, and at this time there is no fix.  He also stated that Corporate informed him this was a Regional issue due to our climate, and they are currently trying to figure out a software fix for the problem.  No resolution at this point.  Corporate further stated that they are seeing this issue when the temperature is between 10 and 30 degrees.  I was offered a 100,000 extended warranty and recommended that I go to the dealer every 500 miles to get an oil change to see if fuel is mixing with the oil.  Shocked at the lack of resolution, I asked the Service Manager if Honda Corporate was comfortable giving me my car back after the cams were replaced with no resolution, and he said Yes.  I do not believe this is ethical at all for Honda to not have a fix to an engine problem that could endanger myself and/or my family.  I am not comfortable taking this car back knowing that the engine could be “scorched” again while driving to a destination.  It is neither safe nor prudent to drive a vehicle that has such engine problems considering it has less than 6000 miles.  This is a BRAND NEW Car!  On day 19 with no car and not final resolution in sight.  I am required to pick up my car when the head is replaced.  PLEASE DO NOT purchase the 2017/2017 CRV EX 1.5 turbo models.  There is no fix to the oil/gas problem!!!",neg
I started smelling fuel in the interior and exterior of the vehicle after 6 mos of ownership. My CRV has been to the dealer 4 times without resolution.  Gas is getting into the oil pan (oil dilution).  This is a very common failure on these vehicles. I strongly recommend that you review 2017-2018 CRV Facebook page.,neg
"If one of the features you are looking to buy the car for is the connectivity and safety of Apple CarPlay, look elsewhere. Our 2017 CR-V is 7 months old and has 5,000 miles on it and we have had multiple issues daily with the Apple CarPlay feature. Many times it will not show up on the display at all that a phone is connected even when plugged in. The dealership said it was because we had the phone connected to the vehicle via bluetooth and CarPlay and we were using a low end cable (we weren't) and we weren't plugging the phone in before the vehicle was started. I expected the next thing to be that we needed to hold our breath, keep one foot outside the vehicle when starting, and touch your tongue to your nose in order to make this feature work. We bought the top of the line CR-V - AWD, Touring, nearly every feature you could get, the only problem is that they don't work which is pretty disapointing from a brand like Honda and after spending $35K for the vehicle. We're being told that ""Apple updates the phones faster than we can update the vehicle software, but we know this is an issue"", however you aren't doing anything about it. In addition to the CarPlay issues we have had several other electrical issues with sensors, particularly the reverse/back up sensors (which have to be installed at the dealership and are not a factory option) not being loud enough to be heard with the radio at a reasonable volume (10-12). We have also had issues with the blind spot sensor on the driver's side indicating that there is a vehicle there when there is not a vehicle there. Does that mean that sometimes when there is a vehicle there it isn't working? We have also had issues adjusting the brightness of the driver display (all digital). Sometimes it will allow you to lower the brightness, sometimes turning the adjustment/trip knob does absolutely nothing. Lastly, when using navigation through CarPlay the volume does not go up high enough to be heard on the highway, and the volume of the radio does not lower to allow the turn by turn navigation instructions to be heard over the radio. While the vehicle does start every morning it is very concerning to have all of these electrical issues wtih a push button start vehicle. There are body pannel/trim fit issues on the vehicle that we didn't notice until we brough it home, its feeling more and more like we bought a lemon. We're currently considering trading the vehicle for something with functional technology or pursuing the Lemon Law here in Texas. It's been a real inconvenience to make multiple trips to the dealership for the same issues without resolution. Short story long...I'd buy something other than a Honda CR-V if I were in the market today.",neg
"The vehicle looks great! However, the small 1.5L engine feels like it’s struggling at times to pull the weight of the vehicle.  The interior looks amazing, but the infotainment system is the biggest piece of trash I’ve ever seen.  Screen goes black constantly, touch screen is not responsive at times, and when it is it’s delayed a few seconds.  The steering wheel in the EX isn’t leather wrapped, making you feel like you’re gripping a CHEAP piece of plastic.  Transmission struggles to keep up compared to the Accord CVT and the Civic CVT.  THIS IS THE MOST UNCOMFORTABLE CAR SEAT IVE EVER SAT IN.  ONE HOUR INTO A DRIVE AND YOUR BUTT IS NUMB.  Be cautious .......",neg
"I purchased my 2017 Honda CRV Touring AWD in June 2017. The day I went to take delivery the salesman was doing his walk around with me and showing me how to operate the car. They were all ready to let me drive off the lot when I pointed out that the drivers seat bolster was malformed and deflated. The mechanic comes out and says they never saw anything like that. So I take the car home and make an appointment to drop it off so they can disassemble the seat to find out what is wrong. After 3 days they get the parts and put the seat back together. I go to pick it up. They seat is ok. Not perfect and the nice tan leather interior is covered in black greasy hand prints. So they bring another guy out to clean it. Which should have been done before I even got there. Fast forward 6 months and it is time for the 5000 mile check up and oil change. I tell them I have been hearing lifter noises and a strange whining from the transmission. After an hour in the waiting room they take me out to the garage to show me the underneath of new car covered in some kind of fluid that is leaking from somewhere under the motor. They don't know what kind of fluid it is. So I have to leave my car while they try to figure out what is wrong with it. A week later I get a call saying they think it is oil and it is the rear main seal. They tell me it was probably like that since my last change, at which time I point out that this is the first oil change on my new car so they say it was probably installed wrong at the factory and has been leaking like that since I got it new off the lot. They also tell me they don't know what they sounds are that I was hearing. So I guess I was hearing things! 3 weeks later they finally have the car back together and are going to drive it for 50 miles and make sure that there is no more leak. I opened up a case with Honda Motor Corp. because I have serious doubts about the reliability of this vehicle since it has been like this since the factory how do I know what kind of damage it has suffered internally? They mechanics say they didn't see any metal chips in the oil but I still don't trust them. I will be getting rid of this car. I don't trust. Honda Quality has gone right done the toilet.",neg
"I bought a new Honda CR-V EX 2017 in February 2017 from the dealership, Castle Honda, in Morton Grove, IL. 

The car has problem getting started and, as a result, has become very unreliable and undependable. It has happened four times already and three times in less than last three weeks. 

First time the problem happened in August 2017 when I tried to start it after not driving it for a week when I was in vacation. I was able to jump start it with my other car. 

Second time the problem happened on 12/11/2017 and I was not able to jump start the car. I had to call the Honda roadside assistance on 12/12/2017 to tow the car but the tow truck guy was able to jump start the car. I drove the car to Castle Honda, the service department did some testing of the battery and said the battery was fine and they did not know the reason for the problem. I told them about the tailgate door not working properly as well, they tested that also and informed me that the struts were broken and and they ordered those parts. I drove back the car home hoping that the problem was fixed. 

I drove the car to Castle Honda again on 12/14/2017 to install the tailgate door struts. I am yet to find out what else is wrong with this car.

Third time the problem happened on 12/29/2017 and I was not able to jump start the car. I called the Honda roadside assistance and this time they sent a guy to jump start the car. I drove the car to Castle Honda, the service department tested the battery again and said the battery was fine and they did not know the reason for the problem. They told me to tow the car next time the problem reoccured. I again drove the car home hoping that the problem was fixed. 

Fourth time the problem happened was on 12/31/2017. I had to wait and seek roadside assistance on 1/2/2018 as the dealership was closed on 12/31/2017 and 1/1/2018. I called the Honda roadside assistance around 6.30 AM and requested specifically for the car to be towed, they said the expected time was between 3 and 8 hours. The tow truck showed up to pick up the car around 11 AM. The tow truck guy from J-TEAM AUTOMOTIVE declined to tow the car and started showing lots of silly excuses of why he could not do it. I did not want to let him go and wait another 5 hours before any help arrived and so I let him jump start the car. I drove the car to Castle Honda and turned it off while waiting in the queue in front of me, the car could not be started after that. The dealership service department tested the battery and this time found the battery to have issues and replaced it. I do not know if this will resolve the issues with the car and the car continues to be as unreliable and undependable as it were.

It appears to me that the dealership sold me a faulty car which has caused me lots of inconvenience and has costed me quite a bit in terms of hassle, time spent on the issues and missed work. 

I have been in contact with American Honda since 12/11/2017 and they have opened up a case on my car. The case manager keeps telling me that they bear no responsibility for the dealership or the roadside assistance and also only thing American Honda can do is to fix any issue the car may have since that’s what warranty is for. He does not appear to understand that having too many issues like I experience make Honda CR-V a inferior quality product, American Honda a low-grade manufacturer and Castle Honda a low-grade dealer. 

I have extremely negative customer experience with Honda CR-V, American Honda and Castle Honda. I will never buy any Honda product and tell others not to buy Honda products as well.",neg
"I switched brands from Chrysler to Honda - based on their reliability ratings. Well let me tell you, throw those ratings right out the window. I traded in a Ram1500 and a Jeep Compass for TWO Honda CR-V's. One is an LX, other is an EX, both AWD. The EX has already experienced a dead battery - left me stranded after only 6 weeks of ownership, something that has never happened to me before in all my years of driving, and I am 64 years old. The dealer replaced the battery, but I still feel like something else might be wrong - - the electronic dashboard keeps doing goofy things. Also, this vehicle is plagued my countless rattles. The other one - the LX, is also plagued by countless rattles, and is at times, hard to start. The only good things I can say at this time, is the vehicles are roomy, and do get good MPG's. I personally prefer the 2.4 engine in the LX, over the 1.5 turbo in the EX. For Honda's so called great reputation, I am highly DISSAPPOINTED, in these 2 CR-V's. I wish I would have stuck with Chrysler products. My recommendation is do not buy Honda.",neg
"This car would probably be fine for me for short, (less than 15 min. trips). The drivers seat becomes very hard after sitting on it for any length of time. Wife drove down to Montgomery, Ala. this wkend and averaged 31.7 mpg @ 75 mph. I guess this is ok for an awd, although it would be nice if that 1.5 turbo was a little less thirsty. This seems to be a quality built vehicle, and it does drive quite nice. The front seats however, are terrible. I also am unimpressed with the audio sound. Honda should have a high-end system in the ex-l.  In summary, I'm glad this is my wife' car and not mine.",neg
Three transmissions in less than 6000 miles. Thankfully we have not needed a fourth. According to Honda the  Bluetooth that stopped working is a problem with my phone not the car... No explanation as to why it worked at first and suddenly stopped. Car still has a high pitched whine upon acceleration only when the air conditioning is on. This was not the case until after the third transmission was installed but Honda Service says nothing is wrong. Still can't trust this vehicle to travel more than a few miles from home.,neg
I would not advise purchasing the vehicle. It is so new that dealerships do not know how to repair issues with the car. I have taken my car for the same TPMS issue that has occurred 5 times and they are still unable to fix the issue. Now I am stuck waiting for a specialist to come out within 1-2 weeks with one day warning to get my car into the dealership. They have replaced all my tires and admit to not knowing what is going on. The dealership now says it is between me and corporate honda. corporate honda is unwilling to provide me a loaner car. Even though tpms is required by law.,neg
Look closely at paint especially the lift gate....underneath mine had like paint bubbles or runs and now it is chipping off...found several on lots with the same thing...just have not chipped off yet....customer service was the worst...don't expect help from corporate because they do not care...I have owned several Honda's and asked them if they were ok with the fact that they would lose me as a customer...and they had no concern,neg
"I loved everything about this car during the test drive. The interior and exterior are amazing. The tech is the best in class and it seemed overall great. Then I took it home and my opinion changed. I tried every seating position and even used cushions, but could not get comfortable. Even worse than that, after 15 minutes in the car my entire foot and leg started to go numb. I made myself take it for a long drive and by the time I got to my destination my entire foot and leg ere completely numb. It took a while to get the feeling completely back and then the pain took over. I was limping the entire next day. So on the way back I tried cushions and other positions and nothing changed. The seats press on my static nerve and cause all of this to happen. I recommend this car for all of its features, but do not recommend it for comfort. If comfort is important to you look at different cars like the Subaru Forester or Mazda CX-5. I will be selling this back to the dealer for a big loss because I refuse to keep a car that will hurt me. Just beware before buying.",neg
"Had the car for 8 hours and it died. The car went crazy and all the lights started flashing on and off (interior, dashboard and exterior). Car would not start. Ultimately had the car towed back to the dealer on a flatbed.",neg
"I purchased a CRV Touring in March.  I selected the Honda over the RAV4, for the safety technology.  On the first day of ownership, the ""safety"" systems failed (adaptive cruise control, crash mitigation, and lane departure) while driving down a country road.  What happens, is that the warning lights start to go off, and then all of these systems are shut off until the car is turned off and restarted.  This problem has occurred on country roads, in a major city, at highway speeds and on residential streets.  I have had this failure at least once every week I have owned the CRV.  Some weeks it has failed 5-6 times.  The vehicle was serviced 3 times in the first 7 weeks of ownership, including 2 attempts by a Honda technician, but they were not able to determine the problem.  The technician wants to blame the problem on country roads, even though the failures have happened in city traffic as well.    I am now in mediation with Honda, but they won't replace the car.  They want to buy my car back because they are concerned that another CRV will have the same problem.   In other words, Honda doesn't have confidence that their ""safety"" systems will work in the country.  My dealer has been great, but Honda of America customer service has been terrible.  My mediation case manger doesn't call me back, or follow-up on anything she said she will do.  Other than this issue, I really like the vehicle, but Honda has made it clear to me that they don't value their customers.",neg
"I purchased a Honda CRV 2017 Touring  January 2017 and I noticed the long tube that connects to both muffler is rusting and molding. I went back to my dealer Paragon Honda in Queens , NY and I was told that it's a manufacturer problem and that is how is made. I am furious because I paid 38,000.00 for my vehicle and they told me there is nothing I can do. I guess I am going to present this case to my lawyer and see what I can do .",neg
"The CRV uses more gas than expected. I am getting 27 miles/gallon in econo mode which leaves me with low power. Getting on the freeway in econo mode takes time but I don't want to have gas mileage lower than that. The gas tank is very small. When gas is getting low, you get a low fuel message and can't see how many miles you have left on the tank. The controls on the screen are impossible to see especially when the sun is shining on the touch screen. Sometimes it goes dim and you can't see the controls to change the AC or entertainment system at all. Or what they call an entertainment system. No CD player at all! The radio doesn't even play local stations that my 10- year old car played fine. The FM goes in and out and is really useless. You have to pay for Sirius to get any stations. But why pay for commercials?? The car is not worth the price I paid for it. I wish I had test driven it longer and checked out the controls better.  If you use the USB for example to play a book, the order in which it plays does not follow the order of the book. It is ridiculous. 

Update: Several months later, still feel the same about not being impressed at all and do not recommend buying a 2017 CRV.",neg
"I really liked everything about the 2017 CRV, materials, comfort, safety features etc.  That was until I did a test drive.  On the street it felt heavy and somewhat underpowered.  On the freeway, it was really bad.  The midrange power and torque is really inadequate.  If I wanted to speed up, I would press the accelerator and the SUV would start to accelerate but then the CVT ""upshifted a gear"".  I would then have to press the gas pedal further but the same problem would recur again and again.  There is no sport mode to make the CVT hold a ""gear"".  This was really bad.  The sales person also admitted that there's always a delay with the CVT which is then aggravated by turbo lag plus the CVT always moving ""up a gear"" making the engine bog down.  Great for mileage, bad for driving.  My driving is between Los Angeles and Las Vegas, as well as Los Angeles to Mammoth, so there are hills, steep grades and passing.  So this SUV is not suitable for my driving conditions and style.",neg
"If you are looking for  A reliable around town car that you keep under 45 or 50 miles an hour, then this is a good vehicle. Otherwise this vehicle is very dangerous on curvy roads and on highways. Any attempt at higher speed, 65 mile an hour breaking or turning is quite dangerous. The brakes are non responsive and the body roll is excessive. Additionally, the front seats are horribly uncomfortable, there is virtually no usable cargo space up front and the headlights on low beam give no side illuminations. When you are turning a corner in the dark you could literally run someone over   Simply because you did not see them. Good reliable around town car. Keep it under 50 miles an hour",neg
The vehicle rides a little too noisy. It lacks power. But is very annoying because the ac sends a stale odor into the cabin after sitting for a few hours. Honda has not been able to fix and tells me to turn the ac off. That's not acceptable. This is our 5th Honda. No major issues before. They all have lacked power and had several squeaks. It usually took me a few months to fix the squeaks... then ok.,neg
"Can't believe there's NOT a trunk release inside the car! If you don't think you'll miss it, make yourself not use the one in your existing car and see if you miss it. Had a 1995 that even had it in there! Asked dealer (after I bought it) where it was & they said the only model that has it is the touring model. The back-up system is so generic, compared to Ford's. When you back up with theirs, the visual is green (ok), yellow (getting closer) & red (you're right on top); the audio is beep beep (ok), beep, beep, beep (getting closer), & BEEP BEEP BEEP (you're right on top). Honda has no audio and bare bone yellow-no comparison. I'm short and although I try not to hit my knee when I get in, I'm frequently nailing it on the console below & to the L of the steering column, also hit my head a lot on the top. The radio is horrible! the buttons are SO small (& I've got little fingers) I'm constantly hitting the wrong buttons while driving, which throws the thing into la-la land; no matter how much I practice on it, it's a pain & I despise it. Car doesn't do well in high winds for handling. Also sounds like the tires are out of round if it isn't driven every day. The AC and heating system take forever to cool/heat. For a $32K car, I would not buy another. I do, however, like the way the seats lie down in the back...that's what initially attracted me to it plus I've owned Honda's since 1985; still have my 2005 Honda which I gave to my son for high school graduation as he'll be using it to and from college. Feel like giving him the CRV but have payments...if I could do it over, I'd buy another Accord. My husband wanted me to buy a SUV since we already had a new Taurus, the Accord and a pick up. Should have listened to my instinct and bought the new Accord!+",neg
Stay away from the 2016 Honda CR-V.... Vibrations issues that Honda has yet to solve.  We have a brand new one with 4400 miles and took the suv in for service on the vibration issue and all they said was this was normal.,neg
"The engine in this 2016 CRV vibrates considerably while stopped in drive and foot on the brake. The front seats vibrate to a point that causes my legs to go numb. The doors and center console vibrates, as well as the dash which is creating a noise from the dash/steering column area. The dealership says this is normal, but I wonder what component/s this vibration will cause to come loose later on--electrical connections, fuel line connections, a/c connections, etc. (not to mention my legs)? I bought this CRV because of a presumed reputation, but am left gravely disappointed. I will never buy or recommend Honda vehicles.",neg
"I financed a CRV SE in September 2016 and two days or so after having the car I had to go back to the dealer complaining about this vibration that is only felt when the car is idle or when stopped at a light and/or traffic. I feel very disappointed in Honda for not having a fixable solution to this problem. The dead just tells that ""it's a V4 what you are experiencing/feeling it's normal"" there no way in hell that you can say that a car that's clearly vibrating and that you as the ""tech or mechanics"" is also feel that there's something not right on the vehicle you can tell me it's normal!!! The worst part is that they tell me that they can get me into another car but it's going to put me a negative equity or something thing like that which means that they are going to give me a quote on how much the CRV is valued as of now and they are going to deduct what the consider out it and then I'll owe the rest! Totally not fair.. I feel that as a ""respectable"" brand as Honda should have more respect and transparency with its customers and fully advice them of this problem! But, that's not all the ""AWD""crap is BS.. I had such a hard time driving in the snow this Winter and to make it worst I was stuck!!!   In the snow. I had to get out and shovel my way out and just so you know I have a bad back! No it's totally unfair to be paying all that money to get into a car that's not even going to give you half of what you are paying for, so do yourself a favor and don't buy a CRV..",neg
"I leased my 2016 CRV in August of 2016. By November 2016, my husband and I began to smell gasoline fumes that would overwhelm the passanger cabin while the car was idling. Honda has admitted that it is a known problem with the 2016 CRV models. PLEASE do some research before leasing or buying. My car has now been at the dealership for FOUR WEEKS without a fix. I am paying for a car that I cannot safely drive. Prolonged exposure to gasoline fumes can lead to a variety of medical issues. With a one year old son, I refuse to allow him to be exposed to the fumes. I hope no one else has to experience the stress that buying a 2016 CRV has caused on my family.",neg

Today is 1/4/2018, my CRV has been sitting at Honda Service Center since 11/14/2017, I have been given soooooooo much run around with this car it's so frustrating, so I went back to the dealership to speak with the GM, some other guy came out trying to act like it was him he went with me to test drive my car, He drove  he get in the car he felt what I was talking about, he drove for about 5 minutes no need to drive any longer because the vibration is there immediately, we get back to the dealership and he trys to give me every excuse in the world as to why all the problems with the car is ok. I went for an oil change and they had to change the battery in a brand new car less then 2 years old, my roof have stains on it come to find out it's freaking leaking, I have video of the radio system malfunctioning and as of this day I still haven't heard from Honda to tell me anything about my car, I'm at my wit's end with The car and Honda I'm going to have to Sue enough is enough, this experience dealing with Honda has elevated  my blood pressure and stress levels so much I get sick just knowing I have to deal with them, I thought my ex boyfriend was the worse mistake of my life but nope nope Honda took the title.
Cooperate office had the nerve to ask me what do I want them to do smh, they offered nothing all they basically said was oops sorry,",neg
"The car is not made efficiently! I have 7,000 miles on the car today. I took the car back to the dealer for noise and vibration. I was told that they replaced the rear Heat shield and that the car was quiet. The car still vibrates at 1200 or less RPM. When I accelerate the noise of vibration is consistent until reaching above 1200 RPM and it runs with plenty of get up but then when descending down a slope the car vibrates and the noise is loud. I have yet to feel comfortable in the car after adjusting the driver seat up and down tilted forward or backward. It simply is not comfortable. There is road noise as well in the cab of the car! It's like driving with the windows open which is not advisable since I live in central Pennsylvania and the temperature is 32 or less. I am totally disheartened by the purchase of this vehicle. I am frustrated every time I have to drive this car. I am totally disappointed and feel cheated in pursuing a new car that I could retire with and not have these concerns and issues. I would not recommend to anyone the purchase of this car and this is my second Honda.  Bob Henry",neg
Was seriously considering a new 2016 CRV.  Went for a test drive and car had a obvious shudder or vibration around 35 to 40.   It also had the a slight vibration while stopped at intersection.    I would never buy a car that rode this poorly.   I was driving home wondering if I was being too critical and realized my 11 year old Toyota rides way better then the new Honda.,neg
"I have new Honda CRV 2016.  Quality of interiors is very poor. The car starts to vibrate within 10 minutes and it is very irritating.  Has transmission issues and Electronics is outdated.

"I can said now that I’m a proudly ex-owner of a 2016 CRV (very expensive washer machine, massage chair…you name it), it was known to happen with the 2015s( service bulletin 15-046) but honda claims it was fixed(which is a lie), so I got a new crv 2016, my mistake, I only had it for 3 months and about 1500 miles but I had enough with the vibration issue, lucky me I felt all the 3 modes described in the 2015 bulletin,. The vibration started @ about 500 miles and getting worst every day, took the car back to the dealer (2 of them) first one told me it was normal, they all vibrate and this is a “characteristic of the car”, the second one agreed with me that it was vibrating but after 10 mins., came back with the same b**l S**t as the first one, what a waste of my time, I called honda and created a case, they assigned me a case manager that called me and kept repeating that’s a “characteristic of the car”( if so, how come is not listed in the brochure?), his only goal was to get me to agree with his stupidity, which I didn’t, I will never purchase a honda again, quality went down the toilet, is not a reliable car anymore and of course their service department sucks.",neg
"DO NOT BUY THIS BRAND. I bought this car on my birthday late May 2016 so far I drove in 5 months 13,000 mile and it broke down with over heat 150 miles away from my home at midnight, I got crazy because I never prepare for this situation with a brand new car. They towed my car to the local dealership and I had to call my family to pick me up and arrived home 5 am.The dealership took one and half day and found the problems and can not find the parts and tell me how long it gonna be to fix it(at this review is writing). THE WORST PARTS IS HOW AMERICAN HONDA CUSTOMERS SERVICE TAKING CARE OF YOU. The dealership told me that they have loaner car for me but I have to come to pick it up by my own, I call Honda car customer service at 1 800 999 1009 and spoke with Stephanie and asked about reimbursement for car rental from my home(150 miles away) and she said no and sorry. She told me that I should tow my car back to the dealership near by my home, it my fault to bring the car to local dealer that night, how I know that because when the tow truck from Honda arrived and he give me two local dealerships to choose.",neg

When trying to pass a car on a 2 lane road this vehicle becomes extremely dangerous and even life threatening due to the slipping transmission. The dealer say's it's normal, but it is not normal at all. Also, the highway miles per gallon barely reaches 19 MPG due to the slipping transmision.",neg
"Good vehicle if you live in city.  Not good if you live in country in Wi., Mn., Mi. etc.  The so called AWD system blows.  I live in county.  Driveway has hill.  If driveway has ice front wheels barely enough to get up hill as they were spinning.   Appears back wheels never kicked in. During winter there were times going into town or home and hoping didn't end up in ditch. No confidence in this vehicle. There are no indicators to notify the driver that the vehicle is in AWD.  Driver has no idea when the vehicle is in AWD if it ever is.  Do I really have AWD ? There are 1-2 sentences devoted to AWD in the owners manual.  An AWD light will come on if the AWD system overheats.  Bet this was done purposely(no indicator) do avoid law suit when someone gets in accident when the driver thinks AWD should have been in place when it wasn't.  If you tilt the front seat back to any degree,which you will need to do if you're taller than 5'10"", you cannot fold the back seat down as it hits the back of the front seat.

"Disappointed in the 2016 CR-V.    It has a serious vibration issue.  It appears that the vehicle was not designed to minimize the impact of the vibration of the engine and the entire car is constantly vibrating regardless of the condition of the road.  In  stop and go city driving it is less noticeable, but it becomes immediately apparent when maintaining speed at 45 mph and gets much worse at highway speeds - 65 to 70 mph.    I did not see this issue mentioned in any online reviews and it was not noticeable in the test drive.  I have subsequently discovered that there are many other CR-V owners with the same complaint and a class action suit has been filed against Honda.   Honda acknowledges that the problem exists in some 2015 CR-Vs and claim they have developed a fix.   They supposedly resolved the issue for the 2016 model, but that is not the case.  Dealership has tried to fix it, but to no avail.   It appears  it is unlikely there will be a fix.   In order to get increased fuel efficiency, they have sacrificed comfort for drivers.    If you do any long range highway driving, I recommend that you do not buy this vehicle.   I know many other loyal Honda owners and they have always been satisfied and impressed with the quality of the vehicles.    Sadly, that is not the case with the 2016 CR-V.  I will be getting rid of this car after owning it for less than 1 month.",neg

"This is my fourth crv, and Honda has ruined it. It vibrates, hesitates, and has a general lack of power. The trim and  interior look cheap and the new electronics suck.

"I had a 2013 Vw Touareg tdi, and it was my wife's decision to buy this vehicle. Worst mistake I ever bought. First off they didn't tell you at the dealership that the vehicle has a special traction control system that automatically works when engaged and almost cost me three accidents because it slams on the brakes then the drivers view on the dashboard goes all nuts. The lights are very distracting on the dashboard and to me can not be turned off. Then the radio setup for blue tooth and radio stations sucks! First off they only give you 10 presets for your Sirius radio which is not good. Especially if you want to hear other things. Functionality of this radio is system is horrible and not very user friendly. Finally the worst thing about this vehicle is the gas consumption. I feel like I'm only 200 miles a week but I had to fill the truck up three times. I'm not impressed if it wasn't for my wife I would never buy this vehicle! Just because it's made from Honda doesn't mean it's a great car. As soon as I can I will get another Vw and stay away from Honda products! Don't waste your money! Get a nicer sub with better gas

The 2016 CRV still has a serious vibration issue and there is no fix from Honda.  I had a 2015 first and was told that the 2016 did not have the vibration issue but that was not true.  Honda used to be a good car but really dropped the ball on this issue.  I would never buy another Honda.  Buyer beware!!!!!!,neg
"Our top of the line Touring CR-V 2WD has only one power seat , only one side camera when turning right. Car has NO lane change avoidance warnings/tones or backing up side avoidance warning/tones When you engage the cruise control the Collision Mitigation Braking System or the Forward Collision Warning will slow you when it senses a car in front of you and when that car drives away the car will down shift to catch up so hold on car goes into hyper acceleration and this is dangerous !  . Now remember this car has a Eco button that softens the gas pedal rate which will save gas but does not inter function with the cruise engaged. The car has electric controlled mirrors but the car won't remember your settings but has a 2 person driver only seat memory  . When in reverse the camera works but will NOT warn you or apply brakes if there is an obstruction in the warning area and the camera is poor visual quality . The screen and it's electronics are not user friendly , When entering the car and starting the radio will come on but you have to use the steering wheel controls to lower the audio sound. Looking for fuel average or instant gas mileage,  it won't be on the fuel screen in the center of the dash you have to select it in the center cluster . I don't even think the mirrors will fold in with a push of a button. The main screen , I have been trying to get the clock to default to if your done with say audio or your done with the navigation . The lane Departure Warning seems the best part of the car it will correct the steering to maintain its position in the lane and warn you if your getting close or it can't sense the lanes position , This is great as an autonomous feature but it will search from side to side of the lane  , I just wish I could adjust the warning signal to integrate into the audio and in a louder tone .  All of this in just 680 miles .

Bought this brand new on 12/31/2014. Traded in a 2012 Accord to get into something with all wheel drive and a slightly taller driving position.  Shortly after purchasing the dreaded idle vibration started to occur. This issue alone would be enough for me to dissuade someone else from buying the vehicle.  Then we noticed that during cold starts there seemed to be a metal on metal grinding noise coming from the engine.  After doing some research this seems to be the VTC actuator which has been a well documented issue on the 2.4 engines for some time which Honda has still not yet fixed.  Now after only three years there is rust forming on the inside of a couple doors from the water drain holes. This car has been a huge disappointment.  Really frustrating because it gets fantastic fuel economy and is an overall practical vehicle. Would 100% recommend a different vehicle rather than this.,neg
"I had high hopes for this car. Bought this one new in April 2015. From day 2 we noticed the vibrations and noise. The rest is history. Dealers will deny that there is any issue with the car. Honda customer care would tell you that they are working on the fix. Once the fix is there, they will not notify you. You have to find out whether there was a fix, go to a dealer, tell them that there is a fix, they will deny it. Go back with proof. Then they will fix it, only to bring it back a month later because the same issue comes back again and again. Come on guys, it is more than 100 years that cars are being manufactured, and in 2015 you guys are making a piece of crap. I wonder how they were able to avoid litigations. Poor vibration isolation, poor internal instrument design, poor noise reduction. I have driven many old cars, none of them gave me this headache that I got from the vibrations of the driver seat.",neg
"I purchased this car 12/31/2014. I thought I was making a good decision even though my 2012 had a leaking roof. I will say my experience with the car and Honda has led me to not buy another car from them again (which sucks - their cars are usually great!). Within 6 months of buying the car, the car would make a creaking/groaning noise when I would make turns at low speeds under 45 MPH. Dealer said they could not hear it. 11 month into owning this car - the vibration issue began to occur. As many people have commented on - the maximum vibration occurs when you are stopped at a light in D with your foot on the brake. It is so noticeable that my passengers have said things about. There has been times I can be at a light and the vibrations radiate up my leg. The passenger seat will shake so much you can see the headrest moving. In November 2015, I had the TSB work done for the vibrations but honestly it still occurred. By March 2017, I was basically in the dealership for 6 weeks straight trying to get the creaking noise fixed. I had video after video of it. They replaced the steering wheel, a rear strut (why?), welded some frame spots, and it never went away. I ended up going to arbitration with Honda - which honestly is not so fair when Honda pays for the program, chooses the arbitrator, and chooses the dealership you bought it from/had it serviced from as the spot of the hearing. I lost the case but filed a suit in Georgia state court (must file in the county where the company is registered and in Georgia it is Glynn County). Anyways I won a settlement and took the check and vowed to not buy another one. Had the vibration and creaking issues not occurred I would have kept this car for a long long long time. The gas mileage was fantastic I could easily average in the 30's going to and from work. The original brakes and tires were still in great shape after I traded it in at 49K. The cargo space is pretty decent. I will say the infotainment is a little lacking - but most Honda's are not the most up to date in that department. Maintenance was pretty much oil changes and tire rotations. The battery died just shy of the 3 year mark, which was a little disappointing. The headlights have always looked good to and I liked the LED strip in them. The engine performance was a little weak but I would expect that if I am getting 30+ MPG, it would be a little more tame than other motors out there. I did like that there is a huge network of Honda dealerships so you could shop around service. Most dealerships tried to take advantage of me trying to push services that were not required by the maintenance minder. I would recommend doing your research before setting foot into them. While I did have some good moments in the car, I am glad it will be someone else's problem now!",neg
"Bought it in 2015, and suffered 2 years of strong vibrations ALL the time while idling. Brought it back to dealer many many times. They had no cure for it. (See class action lawsuit CRV 2015 owners vs. Honda) Finally got rid of it and lost thousands of money but I’m happy it's not mine anymore. Never doing Honda again.",neg
"Really love the car but getting scared off it. Had it at the dealer to be told there is nothing wrong with it but it shakes so bad above 68 mph, I'm about ready to blow my top. Bought a new set of tires about 9 months ago (crv only had about 30K miles) hoping it would alleviate the problem and even went through the pains of having the tires true'd twice (process in which they shave the rubber off the tire to make them round while mounted to the car) with no luck, dealer wanted to blame the tire manufacture so I went and bought another set of tires, this time I bought some really high end tires but got the same effect, steering wheel shaking like a wheel is hopping. Ride is so poor... Really think I won't buy another one of these, love the car but can't deal with this anymore, come on Honda, step up to the base here, the touring is the Cadillac of the crvs, think I would rather had gave my money for what I spent on this to someone who was selling a 1980s Yugo than you, at least with those, they road like a Cadillac!",neg
"I bought mine pre-owned and it had 16,000 miles on it. When I went to drive it with no AC on due to cooler temperatures, it started to shake like it needed a tune up while in drive at a red light. The idle is very rough once it gets to 500-600rpms while at a red light. After doing research, I found thousands of complaints for the same issue from other Honda owners. There is a couple class action lawsuits. I WISH I WOULD HAVE SEEN BEFORE BUYING MINE. I would have bought a different car. Also, when I am going down a hill the transmission revs and gets stuck at 3000-4000RPM and then bucks as I get to even terrain. It’s scary and I don’t feel safe. Also, I have been to a couple Honda dealers and the TSB was performed but the car shakes worse! I even took videos to take to a lawyer. Honda claims my shaking car is “operating as designed”. UNACCEPTABLE and please don’t make the same mistake as me by buying a Honda!",neg

V stands for Vibrator. Honda doesn't stand behind its cars. Since day one this car at idle VIBRATES I took the car in multiple times in but no help from honda. Last honda for us for sure. The rpm are so low to the point is so annoying to the people in the car. During ride everything is fine.,neg
"I have had MAJOR problems with this vehicle and EXTREMELY poor support from Honda in getting it fixed.  I bought this car in December by June, it had 3,000 miles on it and the a/c didn't work - in Texas - in the summertime.  This was the first time I heard ""it seems to be fine to me.  Let's compare it to another 2015 CRV.""   I have heard that phrase EVERY SINGLE TIME I have taken this vehicle in for service.  Each time I have replied ""I don't need to compare it to another.  I know how this car was performing X days ago and it's not performing to that level today.""  Any, I am promptly dismissed.  This exact scenario has taken place at EVERY dealership for EVERY service issue.  And, the service issues have been many: the windshield wipers don't always work, the sound system works intermittently, the dashboard lights work sporadically, the windows leak, and the ever present a/c problems- in Texas. I believe that Honda once made a good vehicle.  I also believe that Honda changed something after the 2014 model year.  Now, anybody I speak with who owns  2015, 2016 or 2017 Honda expresses major disappointment with the vehicle's quality.  I won't be purchasing another Honda.

I have now owned this car for 3 years.  I'm still having difficulties.  It has 27,000 on it and now the back seatbelt doesn't work.  It's just me. Nobody sits in the back.

"Have had my AWD 2015 CRV since October.  When buying I had asked the salesman @ Stevens Point, Wi. Honda when the 16's were coming in.  He stated in the spring.  A month later the 16's were on the lot.  So he lied to me to make room for 16's.  This vehicle is made for those about 5'8"" or less.  It's a little cramped.  When the front seat is all the way back you can not fold down the back seat all the way without hitting the back of the front seat.  The AWD doesn't tell the driver when it's in AWD. Driver has no idea when the vehicle is in AWD.  I am sure this is a decent vehicle for the city but if you live out in the country in WI, MN or other snowy states this is not the vehicle for you.   My driveway has a small hill.  When it's slippery out the front wheels spin.  The AWD never kicks in.  In other words, I don't actually know if I have AWD.  The radio system isn't user friendly.  The CD system behind the screen is a little weird.  Mileage has been good getting between 32-35 on highway.  28.6 overall since owning.",neg
"This is the tenth Honda we've owned, so you know we WERE loyal!  Traded in a 2007 CR-V that we loved.  Our 2015 CR-V was the most uncomfortable car we've ever owned or ridden in.  Couldn't stand to be in it for a trip longer than 45 minutes.  The seats were awful, and the front passenger legroom was terribly restricted compared to our 2007.  It was so uncomfortable that we traded it in after nine months on a 2016 Ford Escape Titanium.  We love the Escape!  It's better in every way than the Honda:  comfort, power, quiet, handling, technology.  We haven't missed anything about our Honda once since the day we drove away from it.",neg
"I bought my 2015 CRV last year and immediately had difficulty with the vehicle shuddering and then stalling.  Now a year later, the transmission has been replaced, but the experience has been horrible.  I had to call Honda corporate and have a case manager because the repairs, even though they were all under warranty, took more than a week to get approved before they could even order parts or begin repairing it.   I was without my car for all of that time, and they wouldn't approve a rental because they said the car was drivable. ( I did finally get a rental, but only for the last 2 of 10 days) If the car needs a new transmission, how it that considered drivable and safe?   10 days later I had my CRV back, and I immediately took it to another dealer and traded it in.  I have lost confidence in Honda products and in their service department.  I have always owned Hondas, but never again.",neg
"Omg, I thought I was going crazy until I read the reviews. My car and passenger seat vibrate, I was told this was normal. Drive the car and it feels like I am stuck in cruise control. Car engine vibrates violently on first start up, brought back to deal and they told me and I quote""operating as designed"". I thought bc I was a female they were giving me this crap, they are but reading these reviews the guys got the same story. Don't waste your money. Car is 9 months old and I'll be trading it in for a Guinean or Toyota. My Santa re was 8 yrs old and had182,000 Plus miles,no one issue.",neg
I bought this vehicle based on having driven my sisters 2013 CRV. This is a very different vehicle. The transmission never engages. When I need to get in an acceleration lane and get up to speed it never takes hold. If you floor it it really confuses it and it starts to fluctuate up and down. I had a 2005 Honda pilot before this and I was ready to take a step down but the storage and fit and finish on this vehicle is not even in the same universe. The console and door storage are poorly thought out and are near useless. My pilot was the exact opposite. I know Honda is chasing good gas milage to compete but in  my opinion this was a big miss. I would go so far as to say this vehicle is dangerous if you are going to take it out in traffic.,neg
"I wrote 2 letters to Honda about the vibration they keep replying to me it's a feature of the car.. I never get a written letter back only voice mail.. DO NOT BUY HONDA BOYCOTT HONDA.. They screw a lot of people on a car and they won't buy it back because it's not a ""safety"" issue.. Car was fix the only way to not feel it is to use headlights..

"Seriously losing confidence in Honda's quality. I've owned 2 cars in my lifetime.. both Hondas.. and both have glaring defaults within. (Previous car: 2001 Honda Accord, which came w/ a bad transmission)

The 2015 Honda CRV came out of the dealership lot driving great. I thought I finally scored a great deal of a car! Then I started reading about the VIBRATION issues the car supposedly had. The car still drove well for another 10,000 miles.. But now, I'm near nauseous at every stop light I find myself at. I look over at the passenger seat, which is shaking madly.. which means that the driver seat I""m sitting on is also shaking likewise. This shaking at idle reminds me of the transmission issue I dealt with in my previous Honda Accord, where the car constant risk of shaking and dying upon acceleration at eery red light. 

I certainly hope Honda does something about their problems with the 21015 CRV. They received incredible ratings and reviews upon initial release and rode it all the way to best seller. This is very unfortunate that the car does not deliver up to value and no has many (and priorly non-returning) customers. 

Very disapointing",neg
"I made the mistake of buying a 2015 CRV and noticed shortly after purchasing a terrible vibration at idle and at varying speeds.  Brought it in twice because I was told they finally had a fix but they lied and were unable to fix the problem.  Now I am unable to drive this car and have 5 years of car payments on a car I can't drive.  Other dealerships will basically give me nothing for a trade so I am stuck.  Please DON'T buy a Honda, they used to be a reliable company but they are not anymore.   I test drove 8 2016 CRV's and they also had the same problem, but Honda continues to sell this vehicle.  No reputable company continues to sell a  knowingly defective vehicle.  How can Honda get away with doing this to people?",neg
"Let me start by saying I am currently in arbitration with the National Center for Dispute Settlement http://ncdsusa.org/ and will move onto Lemon Law litigation. I have a 2015 Honda CRV AWD Touring currently over 13k miles and have experienced an array of problems which really has put a sour taste in my mouth because of the numerous problems with our CRV and the type of response from Honda.  I have taken the car into service departments that have either took note of, tried numerous fixes or not at all, but in the end we are told that nothing can be done because this is a ""characteristic of the vehicle"" and no fix is needed .  I've even been told by my Honda dealer doing the warranty work that I can take my business to another dealer.   I recommend you document all of your visits, even test drives with service advisors, log phone calls and make sure service records state what you reported, what work was done, what was noticed on test drives. I have met with District Parts and Service Manager, filed with Honda Customer Service, sent certified letters and all have resulted in the same response. This is a characteristic of the vehicle. Make sure to file these problems/complaints with Honda Customer Service 1-800-999-1009 and the NHTSA https://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/VehicleComplaint/ so the government takes notice. Here are some of the issues you may experience with the CRV.

 1. Vibration issues for mode 1, 2 and 3 before and after TSB 15-046
-Driving Mode 1: While stopped with vehicle in gear.
-Driving Mode 2: While between 1,000–1,200 rpm at takeoff.
-Driving Mode 3: While driving between 1,800–2,200 rpm around 40–50 mph.
 2. Vibration at highway speeds 70-80+
 3. Shudder, stall when in reverse
 4. Steering issues
-Pulls left under acceleration when wheel centered
-Does not maintain center/neutral position or track straight down the road without excessive intervention. 
-Intermittently needs unexpected intervention through turns as the steering is not direct or does not reflect input from the driver. 
-The steering requires more input in one direction versus another. Intermittently steering becomes very heavy as if no power assist is given. 
5. Car whines/whistles when driving

These are the problems my car continues to have after taking them in to get ""fixed"".

Update:

In the end Honda offerred me a few thousand to close out arbitration while not owning up to or fixing the problems.   I unloaded the car as a trade-in since people seem to keep buying them.  I watched the car sit at the car dealership for months and not sure if it sold or was sent off to auction.   I was going to go through Lemon Law litigation but did not want to put in the time while holding on to the car.    Its a real shame, I have a 2008 Acura RL and have owned many Honda through the years without any problems.   But Honda's bean counters just screwed up.   And now the new Honda Accord 4 cylinder is having issues with the Earth Dreams/CVT combo vibration.   Read the forums.   Google Earth Dreams Vibration.    Go to NHTSA.gov and you will see all the complaints.",neg
"Honda company is disregarding the issue of the Honda cr-v  vibration. It is been 7 months  after some many vibrating trips to the Honda dealer to fix it and no solution.

It shakes like a 20 year old car and the gas mileage is at least a third less than advertised. You will get no satisfaction from Honda concerning the shaking as they claim this is characteristic of the vehicle. The sleazy dealer Metro Honda in Johnston RI sold us this vehicle with full knowledge of the defect in it. This is by far the worst vehicle I have ever purchased. Don't make a huge mistake by purchasing this car. This car still disappoints two years after purchase. It runs like crap and is a total junk.",neg
The vibration is ridiculous. I had two fixes and still have vibration. The amount of time it takes for the cabin to get warm is unacceptable. I live in NE and if it wasn't for the heated seats I'd freeze to death. I drive both city and highway and I haven't even achieved the listed city mpg. This will be the last time we buy a Honda.,neg
"We leased our 2015 CRV for the fact we liked the new body style and the fuel economy was great. We leased for wife to drive and this gave me the peice of mind that the services would all be done at the dealership and she was in good hands. All was well with the suv, we drove it from ohio to florida and back for vacation and it had great fuel economy. However on our next trip to Tennessee we had major transmission problems over 100 miles away from home. On the way I was driving and noticed that the rpms would increase and decrease rapidly. I thought maybe some bad gas was causing the issue and stopped to assess the problem. At idle the car was fine and as I increased the throttle there were no issues. Back on the road about 15 miles and the car seemed to get worse rpms surging. We decided to turn back and limp it home to the dealership we bought it from. About 20 miles heading back the shifts got worse and the D light on the dash starts to flash. I immediately pulled over and safely got to a gas station. By the time I pulled into the gas station the rpms were at 4000 just to get the car to move a little and you could here squelling from the transmission. 3hrs later (I forgot to mention my wife was 4 months pregnant and very emotional as the trip was for valentine's weekend) we got the car to the nearest dealership to assess the transmission. The CRV only has close to 15,000 miles on it and the codes thrown for the transmission were showing total failure. We tried to get a rental from the dealership, but we didnt have honda care just 24hr roadside assistance so they said no coverage. After many calls to our dealership and the 24 hr roadside assistance  (got hung up on a couple times by them) we decided to give up on them. The dealership we were at helped us get a good rate on a rental that WE paid for and decided not to have the car ruin our valentine's weekend and I am actually writing this review in Tennessee. I have been a honda fan as they usually have great cars (I have the ridgeline), but I think they may have tried something new and failed. The new cvt transmission seemed good at first, but now I do not have high hopes for it.",neg
"I have a honda CR-V 2015 only 3000 miles drive.  I felt my brand new car shaken a lot. When I visited dealership, one answer there is normal. How can it be? Brand new car vibration was like 20 years old car. I am very disappointed.
I will never buy honda car at all.",neg
"I've had my 2015 CRV ex-L for 8 months, 7000 miles. I'm ready to drive it into a bottomless pit. 
The vibration issue mentioned here is Unfixable. I've had all 3 of the potential ""fixes"" performed and there is no discernible improvement.  
At this point the only acceptable fix would be getting rid of it.  Steer clear of this model.
UPDATE: 3 years and 36000 miles later, still vibrating at idle. It idles at 600rpm and shutters because that’s just too low. Shakes the whole vehicle.  What a disaster and disappointment from Honda. 
Also the entertainment system is lacking. The speakers are weak (very weak bass), the radio buttons are tiny as can be ( like from a cheesy ‘80s tape deck), and layout and design counterintuitive. Total fail. 
Also TPMS is faulty, just like in our Honda Fit. Warning light always comes on erroneously, and never wants to go off.  Back to the drawing board again, Honda.",neg
"This is not our first Honda CRV but it may be the last. We purchased a new 2015 Honda CRV and the dealer did not have the integrity to say that there was an issue regarding the vibration or shuddering at lower rpm's. Honda has a video concerning the problem which had I known about would have at least alerted me to the problem. The dealers know about the video but most consumers do not know about this video. Can not believe a manufacturer for which many have high regard would dump such vehicles on the buying public. Honda let us down after getting our cash.  My word to the wise: DO NOT BUY A NEW HONDA CRV. You have been warned. I understand there is a pending class action suit against Honda and hopefully if there is any justice, we who have been screwed by Honda will receive some sort of meaningful resolution.

The above review was written awhile ago and since then, we have rid ourselves of the Honda CRV for which the manufacturer should know we replaced with a 2017 Subaru Outback that is far superior to any Honda I have owned previously.  Problem solved without any thanks to Honda for their inexcusable indifference.",neg
"1.  Navigation. Resets at toll booths. Continually recalculates. Requires three different shots on two screens to show a turn. Cannot adjust frequency, so you will be told 4 times in the last mile before approaching a toll booth. 

After one year:  the GPS in downtown Chicago is constantly one street off.  You have to stop, turn off the ignition and start again.  The GPS will constantly take you to a toll booth or major intersection and then reconfigure.  

After two years:  Friday the GPS system froze and then went blank.  I did not pay the update fee, but it is completely dead now.  

2.  Vibration. I have now had the car in 5 times. I have had all of the parts replaced, the software fixes. It still vibrates. It gives me a headache.   The winshield split across the middle one day.  

After one year:  the vibrations never stopped.  Its just such an awful car after a while its kind of funny yet sad.  

After one year:  I wanted blue tooth for the phone, had to stop using it.  Those on the other side constantly complain about the noise.  The car has numerous rattles.  I maintain the car religiously as I drive a lot.  

After two year:  the vibrations continue.  I usually put the car in neutral at stop lights to stop the shaking.

Fall 2016 in for transmissions issues, belts are slipping off the transmission.  Just never ends.

Spring 2017:  75000 miles:  I go to start the car, nothing.  The battery went dead unexpectedly.
Spring 2017:  80000 miles: a noise develops and the next day is so bad I have to take it in, the water pump went out.  
Fall 2017:  key fob batteries keep going dead, have replaced both twice now

I have driven seven Hondas. I will never drive another. It is, to be perfectly honest, an awful car.",neg
"Alert! Those who want to purchase this car, please test drive it for at least 200 miles :) and go for a decision.  Look for videos and blogs reporting vibration problem in this car. You will find a ton of them. Worst part is that, even though Honda is aware of this problem, it is getting rid of its stock with out fixing the problem. Customers have to go to the dealership and beg for the fix. Dealership is not ready to take the car back. Really disappointed with this purchase. Will never trust Honda. They have performed 4 repairs on the car in the first month. Now that they are completely exhausted with their solutions they are pretending that the car is in good condition now and nothing needs to be fixed.",neg
"I purchases this vehicle in August of 2015. I put roughly 3,300 miles on it. While driving it on December 12 the transmission failed and I was stuck on the side of the Hwy waiting 4 hours for a tow truck. The dealer replaced the transmission and I was able to pick up my vehicle yesterday December 29th. On the way home I noticed a couple odd sounds while driving at highway speeds (55-60 mph). I now have about 3,400 miles on the car so it will be interesting to see if the transmission simply needs a break in period or if I will experience this trouble again. I love everything else about the vehicle, I am just hoping that it will be reliable from this point forward.",neg
"We bought our 2015 CRV wanting to keep it for a longtime, but with the vibration issues it doesn't look like thats going to happen. I can't believe that Honda would allow this vehicle to be sold without a notice to the consumer. If they disclosed the vibration issue it wouldn't be the #1 selling SUV. Honda really ruined the brand with me. I have owned 4 Accords, 2 Pilots, we just bought my daughter a HRV and now this piece of junk CRV. This is the last Honda I will buy.",neg
"Yes, the SUV vibrates..As the driver, you don't notice too much.  But literally 7 out of 7 passengers have said they feel dizzy or a bit sick whenever they are in it.  The interior quality is like a Chevy, and that's not a compliment.  Hard touch plastic everywhere.  Yes, I bought the LX, the base, but I recently traded this for an Ouback, and the Outback is on another level of quality.  Before the Outback, I drove the Touring, the top CRV made, it's literally the same quality on the panel, dash, door...Even with leather seats, the rest of the interior is cheap...I'm sure the transmission and engine will last 200,000 miles, but the engine does not work with the car, thus the vibration.  And the interior is closer to a toy than a real car.  I have owned 11 new Honda's, there will never be a 12th.  My last civic was also pretty cheap feeling.  I drive 50% on highway, 50% in town, and never got better than 21.6 mpg.  The other day was the first day in Oregon we had frost on the window.  I turned on the car to warm it up, waited 2, 2.5 minutes for it to warmup a bit, and turned on the defrost, 100% on high...It took 11 additional minutes before I could barely see out of the bottom of the windshield...At 14 minutes, with the help of wipers I could see safely enough to drive.",neg
"I purchased a new 2015 Honda CRV in August 2015. I had read a review that stated it was the SUV of the year and some other publications seem to echo good quality... However it turns out there is a known issue with the 2015 version of the CRV that causes the car to vibrate. Its a issue with the new CVT and engine combination they used in the 2015 version of the CRV.  

I only test drove the car for a short time and did not notice the issue but it turns out that if you have the lights on and the AC on full you will not notice as it forces the car to be in a higher RPM range (all the time). I test drove this in the summer and so the AC was on. The day I went in to sign the final paperwork for the car I asked about the vibration issues as I had read some real reviews from real customers complaining about it and was told its nothing to worry about.  Well turns out that when it got colder I started to have more and more of the vibrations. I took the car in multiple times to have them try to fix it. None of the fixes completely resolves the issue it just makes them less noticeable. I even had the newest fix done in December 2015 where they had to replace parts of the car... to try and fix all 3 modes of the issue... Still not fixed this car was too expensive to just deal with. A 30k car should be basically perfect, thats premium car price range.

If I had been told the about the issue by the dealer I would not have purchased this car. I would have happily purchased the HRV or maybe even an accord. Now I have lost hours and hours of my life researching this issue and taking it in to get it fixed and its still not. I also asked the dealer if they would trade the CRV and they said they would not since they would then have to deal with it.  They also just told me to talk to Honda directly. (I am in contact with Honda directly now we will see where that goes...)

So to be fair this is in part Honda's issue but it was also the dealer that did not disclose the information to me. Otherwise the dealer did a decent job... price was average and they were nice enough but that does not matter given my car is not what I expected. I can't stand the vibration personally (some people claim to not notice). I am now going to have to take a loss of thousands of dollars trading it in on something else that does not vibrate.

"I have a very wonderful family with a typical normal  life, and I bought this Honda CRV 2015 a month ago for my family to enjoy  their everyday rides. But  this car was a nightmare for all of us. It has a multiple Vibration modes such as, Acceleration at 30-40 Mph, 50 to 60 Mph and the worse is, when we stop and in Drive shift gear, its feel like the whole car is vibrating. Every time I get out of this car my hands feels like I use a ""Jack Hammer"" after a while. This  is very unsafe to drive co'z I am always getting out of focus on my driving, and it is very annoying and mentally stressful while driving it. This is frustrating,  it's caused Our Money, Our Safety and Our Health. I am not sure how long can I keep this car, but for sure, I will not recommend this Brand anymore to all my friends and to all people I know.",neg
"I bought a 2015 Honda CRV Touring in December of 2014.  I noticed the vibrations shortly after buying the car.  I have 12K miles on the car now.  The vibrations have gradually become worse, and I'm getting extremely annoyed by them.  It's not only at idle when the vibrations occur.  It's also at any speed while accelerating gradually.  The whole car shudders, the vibrations resonate through the entire car, and my entire body.  They seem to get very bad at highway speeds (70+ mph).  It's to the point where I dread driving this car, and I dread pressing the gas pedal at all.  It's by far the worst driving experience I've ever had, especially for a new car (that I paid well over 30K for).  I have finally had enough, so I'm going to start voicing my frustration.  If I could get a refund on this car, I would in a heartbeat.  I'm hoping Honda finds a solution, but I'm certainly not holding my breath on that.  I have debated posting this, because I know all these vibration complaints will kill the resale of 2015 CRV's.  So I may be stuck with this lemon for a while, unless I want to take a huge monetary loss on a resale.  If Honda can't come up with a fix, or compensate the CRV owners in some way, this will be my last Honda ever.

I should note, if not for the vibrations, I would be mostly happy with the car.

Since I'm here, I'll make a few other comments on the car.  I don't like the low beam headlights.  They have a very sharp cut-off line on top.  It makes if very difficult to see on rural roads, especially those that are curvy and hilly.  On some hills/curves, you can only see 20 yards ahead.  I don't think this is an issue specific to CRV's though.  Other Hondas, and other makes of cars, also have this sharp cut-off line.

The Collision Mitigation System (CMS).  This is the system that (supposedly) detects a potentially collision, and will warn the driver via an audible warning, light breaking, or heavy breaking.  I was driving to work one day, going around a curve to the right on a two lane highway, with traffic coming the other way.  Out of nowhere, my CRV beeped, and applied light breaking.  It scared the crap out of me.  The CMS radar erroneously detected a potential collision, because of the angle of the curve I'm sure.  If I was on icy roads, this could have sent my car out of control.  I was tempted to disable the CMS system (you do have that option via a push-button on the dashboard).  I have not disabled it yet, but if this happens again, I will seriously consider it.",neg
"To update my review, the vibration problem is still there. The dealer updated what they called a software problem which had no effect that I could tell. They rotated and balanced the tires which did not solve the problem, it still vibrated. I returned to the dealer and they had a mechanic ride with me who told me it was the Dunlap tires and I should buy Michelin tires when these wear out. I have since had the tires balanced again with no improvement. So I'm not spending anymore money, it's just going to have to vibrate. I plan to get rid of it soon and Honda will not be my next car. If they can't put tires on their car that will balance and ride smooth I'm done.
I have two main problems with this car. The first is the vibration when at idle and at highway speeds. The vibration at 65 -70 mph is felt both in the driver and passenger areas and Honda has no solution for it. The dealer tried new software but did not correct the problem and said Hoda is working on more upgrades. In the meantime we have to drive a car that's shaking like crazy. The second is the hesitation at low speeds which I understand is caused by the transmission. When trying to accelerate through a intersection the car just hesitates then finally will start to accelerate. This is a safety problem. Dealer says that's the way the transmission is. I thought I was buying a car that would last a long time but now I'm stuck with this thing with no solution in site. DONT BUY ONE.

Miller Honda has balanced and rotated the tires but it is still vibrating. The service manager is going for a ride with me this week and is anxious to solve my problems with this car. I look forward to this being fixed
The hesitation at an intersection was caused by me having my foot still on the brake, driving with two feet.",neg
"Do your research - search 2015 CRV vibration problems!  It is terrible!  When you are in drive and stopped in traffic or at a stoplight, the front seats vibrate so badly it is terrible.  This is an issue Honda knows about and yet they keep selling these.  The dealers ""seem"" to be in the dark because they don't want you to know.  Do yourself a favor and if you still want one of these cars, take it on a good long test drive so it warms up.  This starts once it is warm because the rpms drop so low.  I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.",neg

"Purchased our CR-V two weeks ago and immediately noticed significant vibrations both at idle as well as under way (typically under 2200 RPM). Trips to two different dealers with recommended software updates, rebalancing of wheels and alignment checks have not resolved the issue. A Web search shows that the issue seems to be fairly common with this year's model with no solution in sight. Honda has actually issued the following Youtube video (www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEJ45wX9ycI) acknowledging the problem. We are now stuck with a defective product with no accommodation from the dealer.

"I just bought my CR-V 2015 EX two days ago, and start to feel vibration everywhere inside the car (seatings, Steering Wheel, Side Doors, Arm rest) and more severe when I am on stop and on D-shift after a 30 miles of driving.  I was so upset when  I realized that there is no fix yet to this issue. I brought it back to the dealership two days after to ask for exchange or any option I may have but they refused to deal with anything except to cut-off you a 3K for buy back. I hate those dealership people in San Diego, they are totally liar, they hiding something just to sell their junk to consumers, they are the worst people I ever met. I tell you, you can not feel this problem during the test drive coz they will direct you on where to go for just one mile approx. and not enough to warm-up the vehicle. Now, every time I go out from this car, I feel my hands shaking and with headache and mentally affecting your driving concentration. This issue is a total recall, American Honda should do something so soon about this issue (or fix it) before anything happen to the consumer who experiencing this problems.",neg
"The 2015 CRV is plagued with vibration problems.  Honda admits this but has no solution.  If you feel you still want to test drive one make sure you do the following:
Turn off the audio, turn off the fan, turn off any a/c, turn off any headlights or wipers.  Make sure you drive the car until it is warmed up 10-15 minutes.  Windows up.  After warm up, stop car in D, foot on brake, car will vibrate.  Might do it in reverse as well.  If you take along a cup of water and place it on the center armrest,  it will be obvious.  Next accelerate up to ~ 2200 rpm.  Car will vibrate between 1800-2200 rpm.  More like a buzz as if something was loose in the back, something metallic.  If you maintain the rpm range at around 2000rpm, the vibration will remain constant.  The first vibration described is called mode 1 vibration by Honda.  The second type described is called mode 3 vibration by Honda.  They also reference in their video online a mode 2 vibration which occurs at over idle engine speeds but below the 1800-2000 rpm threshold of the mode 3.  Those buyers here who have negatively reviewed the 2015 CRV for excessive vibration are not exaggerating.  It does exist.  It is admitted by Honda.  They have produced two online videos addressing this defect but have not as yet delivered an effective solution.  This problem has existed with the 2015 CRV since its introduction.  That's over one model year ago, yet no solution.

Like many others, I trusted Honda as I have owned eight in total (3 CRV's).  As a result, I did not do these things when I test drove the CRV I bought.  I was unaware of the defect.  My test drive was with the a/c on, radio on, headlights on, fan on.  This will mask the idle mode 1 vibration, these items raise the engine rpm, which mitigates the vibration at idle.  The audio and fan noise will, at what I consider to be medium volumes, mask the mode 3 vibration noise as you accelerate through the 1800-2200rpm range.

This vehicle isn't ready for prime time at any price let alone what the varying models sticker for.  If you buy one you will be stuck with it and likely a significantly reduced resale value for years to come.

No new car at any price should sound and vibrate like these things do.  Buy something else or just keep what you've got...fair warning.

UPDATE:   Honda applied all listed fixes 12/15.  Solutions were effective for approximately 6 months when the mode 2 and mode 3 vibrations returned.  The Honda authorized solutions are not effective.  Dealer will not address the issue further.",neg
"My (top-of-the-line)  2015 CR-V which I purchase on July 22, 2015 has an engine that is malfunctioning.  It frequently and unexpectedly fails to accelerate when the accelerator is depressed.  In fact, the vehicle stalls/slows down during these occurrences.  Getting through intersections and merging with traffic can get real exciting. These failures have been witnessed by as many as three licensed drivers.  A Honda dealership has done two diagnostic test and driving test and can not replicate the condition.  The dealership and American Honda Motors express they can not repair a vehicle if they cannot identify the problem.  My question is if their technician is riding in the car and the acceleration fails how will they identify the cause especially when their diagnostic equipment does not identify the failure(s).  At this time, both the dealership and American Honda Motors tells me there is nothing they can do for the malfunctioning car they made.  This leaves me with a $40,000 piece of junk (in my opinion).  A car for which I am paying over $40,000 and it is unsafe to drive.",neg
"I purchased this car in April, and notified the dealership within the first week that there was a vibration.  They acted like I was crazy, they'd never heard of such a thing.  My car now has 5800 miles on it, and the vibration has gotten worse.  You can feel the vibration through the steering wheel, the passenger seat and the drivers seat usually at 2000 RPM and at 1000 RPM.  It also vibrates at idle, but not consistently.  The vibration at 2000 RPM becomes very pronounced at highway speeds around 70-75 MPH.  It feels like driving on rumble strips.  I've had the car back into the dealership 3 times.  I've even tried a different dealer to see if they would be more honest about acknowledging the problem.  My experience has been the same each time:  The service manager tells me that the ""slight"" vibration is a normal characteristic of the CRV.  They say that I'm the only customer out of the thousands that they've sold this car to who has complained about the vibration.  They say that they haven't even heard of the 2 Youtube videos released by Honda Corp. acknowledging the vibration and claiming that it's their top priority to fix it.  They say they know nothing about a software update from August addressing the mode 3 vibration. (which doesn't work)  They say that there is nothing wrong with my car and that the performance falls within normal specs.  They say that the ""normal"" vibration is not a safety issue.   They tell me that what I'm feeling is feedback from the road conditions.  

If it wasn't such a huge financial fiasco for me, this would be funny.  Apparently I know more about the 2015 CRV issues and Honda's response than any sales person or service tech in my area.  They drive the car and tell me they can't feel anything except road feedback.  It's beyond frustrating.  Of course they offer to sell me a different car, but I'll have to take a hit on my trade in.  

If this is the new normal for Honda, then this 25 year Honda customer will be moving to a different manufacturer.  DON'T BUY THIS CAR.  Don't you think that if Honda believed the vibration was normal they would have already had the 2016's on the lot?  When's the last time they released the new year model AFTER the 1st of the year?  There's a reason Honda has delayed the release of the 2016's.  It's a serious problem, NOT a normal characteristic.",neg

This is a major concern when backing up around sidewalks or busy parking lots as you lose concentration.   Starting to get mode 2 vibration also.   The techs at Honda are aware and could care less.   Guess only recourse it to keep taking it in and the try to fight them with lemon law.  The navigation and the whole setup is counterintuitive, someone really has to clean up the logic here.

"Good news about the rough idle/vibration design flaw---they have acknowledged it exists. 

Bad news? Everything else. There is no word on when a fix will be available. And of course no clue as to what the constant vibrations mean to the long term stability of the car. No urgency because they aren't killing anyone with the car or polluting the planet. They are simply selling a car that vibrates like crazy every time you stop in traffic.

Nice huh? 

I'm a lifetime Honda owner. Have never seen anything like this. A car that can't operate without vibrating --and I'm talking serious vibrating and a rough idle that feels like you are about 3 seconds from a sputtering stop--a car that does that is a nightmare.

I did test drive a CR-V and it was ok but, I changed my mind for another color and bought a same car with different color assuming both performs the same. Honda CR-V has a serious problem of VIBRATION. When the car drives at some particular speed (like 20-30 and 50-60 mph) or if the vehicle is stopped at a signal or a stop sign, the car vibrates like anything.  HONDA KNOW THIS ISSUE but selling cars without fixing the issue.  When I noticed the problem just after a couple of days and took my car to the dealer, they said "" THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE. HONDA KNOW THIS PROBLEM. WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING AS THIS HAS NO FIX YET. WE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE TO FIX THIS ISSUE. WE WILL LET YOU KNOW ONCE WE HAVE ANY FIX. THIS HAPPENED TO ACCORD 2 YEARS BACK AND FIXED AFTER A WHILE. EXCEPT THIS ISSUE, YOU GOT A NICE CAR"". I don't know what they mean by NICE car if it has a serious problem in the core, and the NICE car they said costs $32000. So, please make as many test drives as possible. Don't get disappointed after buying the car. Don't just trust the car by its brand image (as I did).  i assume that my warranty period would be completed by the time they got a fix for this and I may have to pay again for the fix.  VERY DISAPPOINTED.",neg
It's been a couple of years now and I still feel the same disappointed. I'm finally giving up and going back to Toyotas. I bought the 2015 CRV in October of 2014. It was the only one on the dealer's lot. I didn't notice the vibration when I test drove the car but I certainly experienced it within the first week. I've taken the car back at the least 10 times for either the vibration or the car shutting off for no reason. I received little to no help from the dealership or Honda's Headquarters. I also asked for them to either buy back or allow me to swap for something else. I was denied any further assistance and met with sarcasm.  I'm 100% disappointed.,neg
"We bought our eighth -- and last -- new Honda in March 2015. We drove the CRV-EX AWD just 1,600 miles before trading it for a 2015 RAV4 because we experienced unexpected acceleration on several occasions and received no help from Honda. I was stunned. I couldn't believe how a longtime loyal Honda owner could be treated so poorly by Airport Honda in Tennessee and American Honda. I wanted American Honda to buy it back and told the representative that I would gladly pay for the mileage.

Here's what happened: I took the car to Airport Honda on Aug. 26 so they could check it out. Since the problem was intermittent, I halfway expected that they wouldn't find a problem, especially given the way they treated me upon arrival. Despite showing them Internet reports of unexpected acceleration in CR-Vs, they said that they had never heard of such a problem. I explained that there's no way I would make this up since it caused me a lot of trouble taking off work and driving 40 miles (round trip) so they could see if they could ""replicate"" (wink, wink) the problem. The best I could get was a car that functioned properly. After keeping the car for two days, of course they told me the car was fine.

So when it became obvious that the service department was of no use, I tried to trade the car for either a 2016 Pilot or another CR-V, although that prospect scared me somewhat because I didn't know if I could trust another CR-V. They said they'd call me with a trade figure, but they never did as they obviously didn't want the absolutely pristine gray CR-V with the added $500 options of a hood deflector, mud flaps and a sunroof visor -- all genuine Honda parts installed by Airport Honda. I called them back and spoke to Bruce Wayne (no kidding), and he wouldn't provide a trade figure many hours after he said they'd have those numbers in a few minutes.

In the end, I lost several thousand dollars and all respect I had for American Honda and Airport Honda. Our RAV4 with a conventional six-speed transmission is rock solid and the dealer, Fox Toyota, is perhaps the most honest and best in America. Reports of Honda's decline certainly don't seem to be exaggerated based on my experience. Oh, and I forgot to mention how the CR-V's engine sent vibrations through the cabin with the car in drive and the brake pedal depressed. Airport Honda acknowledged that problem but said there isn't a fix at this time. Anyway, I just hope no one gets killed in a CR-V when it takes off.

Many months later, nothing has changed. Honda is an arrogant embarrassment.",neg
"I don't know whether other 2015 CRV owners are facing similar issue or not. My vehicle once stopped all of a sudden for no reason while I was driving on highway. All the maintenance indicators of my car like 'Low Engine Oil Pressure', 'Vehicle Stability', 'Tire pressure', 'Battery' etc got switched on and my vehicle came to stop. After several attempts to start it, it finally started after 40-45 minutes. Honda on-road support told that it would take around an hour to reach me, even though I was within the city limits.
The same issue occurred when once I was starting the car. The car stopped within a few seconds of my starting it. After several attempts to start it, it finally started after 20-25 minutes.
This happened twice for my 8 months old car.",neg
"This is my third Honda. Vibrations started from the beginning and got worst. It is difficult to drive Honda CR-V 2015. My body vibrates, a couple of times I was very close to be in accident. I was waiting on the Red signal and car started acting very loudly. Car also vibrates on ""P"" and when I push gas pedal. In the beginning I though it was my imagination, I trusted HONDA so much. Dealership knew that those cars have significant issue and they keep selling to make profit.",neg
Please.please...before you buy one do your research on the vibration problem that Honda is saying is a characteristic of the new Honda 2015 CRV. Met with a Honda America guy 2 weeks ago and he is saying All the 2015 Honda CRV have a characteristic of vibration. It comes with all the new cars. Honda not willing to do anything about it. Driven Honda's all my life. Never agin. Even if you do not know it your car will vibrate. My car started vibration problem.. 2 months after I bought it.  Please do not buy one. You will be sorry.,neg
"I Purchased a new 2015 Honda CRV about 3 weeks ago. It had only 4 miles on it. When I started driving it I noticed a vibration at stop lights. I thought maybe it was a beak in issue or maybe something was wrong with the gas in the vehicle. Well now I have around 1,500 miles on the car and the problem only seems to be getting worse. Whenever the vehicle is at a stop and idling in drive the car has an excessive amount of vibration. At times it seems as if it is going to stall out. I have a scheduled appointment with the dealership. Disappointed to see others are having the same issue with no real solution from Honda.",neg
"Vibrations worsening. Purchased my cr-v 2015 at the end of May this year. I started noticing Vibrations not long after purchase. I purchased this vehicle because I had been in a car accident and my 2006 Toyota RAV4 V6 unlimited (which I Miss) was totaled. I owned a Honda Prelude as a kid in The 80's (LOVED that  car) and I thought I'd give Honda another look expecting the quality I was familiar with. I can't begin to describe my disappointment. Every thing else in the Crv 2015 is up to par, but let's face it, the most important is how it DRIVES. I wanted to ignore the initial vibrations. After all the crap I went to due to the accident, I stuck my head in the sand. I thought perhaps it was because of the cvt transmission which is something I've never driven before. Now I know this is NOT NORMAL. The vibrations have worsened. I sometime feel like the car is going to cut out on me and now I'm feeling vibrations in the steering wheel. I noticed that there was a recall back in March of this year after I did some digging. I called my dealership and according to my PIN number, my vehicle is not part of that recall. [non-permissible content removed]. Bringing it in this Saturday to be analyzed.  Let's see what happens. Car has about 3700 miles on it. I'm pretty sure the dealership was aware of this problem BEFORE I purchased it. I am PISSED!",neg
"I bought my CRV in May after doing a lot of research.  Unfortunately, I did not come across the information regarding the CRV vibrating when the car is idle.  Not only do I experience this issue with my car, but the vibration is actually getting worse, and it is very uncomfortable.  Additionally, my brand new car also has a very loud rattle in the dashboard area.  I will be bringing my car into the local Honda dealership to see how these problems can be resolved.  Even if these issues are resolved, I predict that I will never buy another Honda vehicle.  In summary, don't let the attractive aspects of this car (safety features, overall design) fool you, because the problems that go along with this car are not worth the price.",neg
"i bought the car 3 weeks , the fog lamp glass broken,,if the screen glass maybe easy broken when you driving on the highway,,so be carefully to think about buy this honda car",neg
"Terrible road noise above 40 mph. On rubberized asphalt noise is ok, but on normal roads it's terrible. I have been a autobody tech. for 40 years, worked for Honda several times and have owned several used Honda cars. Honda has a Great reputation, but I wish I would have done a longer road test. I won't have bought it. Also gas mileage 26.8 city and 27.6 highway ?",neg
"My car is 1.5 months old, bought new from dealer. I noticed this vibration problem 3 days after I bought the car. I bought it back to dealer one  time with no fix. I just don't know why some cars have no vibration issue or maybe they can live with this issue. But I can't.I thought  Honda should not be selling this kind of  car if they know there is problem. Also I have one more Problem in car when I start car from stop I feel vibration in car for few seconds, I showed to dealer. He told me that Honda knows about that they are working right now on that issue. I spent $30,000 for a brand new car that has problem in a month. If I know this kind of issue I never never bought Honda.",neg
"My car is 1 month old, bought new from dealer. I noticed this vibration problem 3 days after I bought the car. I bought it back to dealer two times with no fix. I just dont know why some cars have no vibration issue or maybe they can live with this issue. But I can't. I spent 30,000 for a brand new car that has problem in 3 days? Honda should not be selling this car if they know there is problem. I don't know what else i can do besides writing bad reviews here and there.",neg
"I bought the car with rave comments from Honda of Fishers ( Indiana) It had 200 mls on it from being transported from another city. Day after purchase I drove to Ft Wayne, discovered the car had major vibration issue. Was told they couldnt take it back becasue I had put 200 mls on it myself! Took it in for service and they said they couldnt feel the vibration. I have taken it to two different locations to get opinions and no one can believe this problem was not disclosed before purchasing.  I get online and see hundreds of others going through the same thing. The dealershp said Honda is going to find  a fix, but so far nothing. They said the problem doesnt cause  issues so there is nothing I can do.  I honestly feel the vibration in my body even when I'm not in the car. I drive a lot for my job and concerned that this may be causing me headaches..my arms and hands are itchy when I get out. It vibrates all the time but severely when foot is on break while in drive...the jackhammer name was given by a friend who could not believe Honda is not standing by this..
The management at this store has not contacted me and I bought this in April and have called and left messages, no response. I was deliberately lied to at sales. I am very upset and so disappointed. I don't think this will go without issues arising in other parts of the car with such a problem as this. Never will I trust this dealership again and until Honda takes care of this I will spread the word because YOU do not need to go through this!",neg
"Honda knows about the vibration issue with transmission/motor match-up- when I talked with Honda of North America, all they said was they ""were working on it"".  I have driven Hondas for over 20 years and relied to heavily on my past experiences with Hondas in buying this clunker. Still no fix for the vibration issue -don't even bother to ask-same answer, after 1.5 years.  Everything else about my CRV is just fine.  Spartan interior and functional. Nav system is counterintuitive and not easy to program., you get used to it.  Still think it does not live up to its hype-a lot of other choices for 33k(touring model).",neg
"I purchased a 2015 CR-V in April of 2015. I have always had Honda vehicles and have never been as disappointed as I am right now. On this past Friday afternoon, I got into my CR-V in 96 degree weather and my AC was not working. I immediately called Honda and made an appointment for the following morning. When I got home, my husband, who is a mechanic, checked it out just to see. He said the compressor was working and the belts were all running. So the sensor was sensing freon. Well we got to Honda the next morning, waited for 2 long hours, for them to say a rock or something hit my condenser and all my freon leaked out. And, of course, MY WARRANTY DOESN'T COVER IT. It will cost me $400 to replace all of this. They did offer a $100 discount since the car was so new, however, I asked how a dent in my condenser that is smaller than a dime could take out my AC in the 3 months I've had it. They said the condenser is made out of aluminum and is very fragile. There is NOTHING guarding this on the front of my car. I called the Honda Customer Service in my warranty book. The woman I spoke with flat out refused to reimburse me as well. I understand that an act of nature CAUSED this. However, if the condenser had been made out of stronger material or had protection covering it, this would never have happened!! I should not have to be replacing my AC after having my car for 3 months!!!",neg
"Bought a 2015 CR-V new less than a week ago. For the first few days it was a perfect car, then it started vibrating horribly at idle when in drive. Apparently this a known issue (just search the internet, Honda even has a video about it) that the ""reputable"" car rating websites chose to ignore when giving the car five star ratings. Don't be tricked into buying this car.",neg
"I've had this vehicle for 26 months & 13000 miles of mixed driving. It's been getting 22.5 mpg, & I've been babying it w/eco mode on. If you drive it ""normally"", it drops to 22 in eco mode, & 21 w/o eco mode.

Unless you have super quick reflexes to hit the eco button to disable eco mode in an emergency, leave it off or the car has virtually no pickup.
 
The interior of the doors is all cheap plastic, and there's very little in the way of support behind the door panels. I tend to lean my left leg against the door when I drive, and it's already starting to ""give"".

The door panels rattle and the dealer says it's ""normal"". Really?

The console box is small compared to my Camry & the USB/HDMI connections are in there; if you keep stuff wired up, there isn't much usable storage in there. 

Little pickup but handles well.

The tech package isn't ready for prime time. Lane departure warning gives more false alarms than legit and I keep it off. Lane keep assist (self steering) works ok on a clean road with freshly painted lines, but any little thing makes it lose sight of the road and it constantly warns you to take over full control. More of a distraction once you get past the novelty of it.

Pass on the tech package: $5000 and it is not Tesla's or Google's self driving car, not even close

Update: Jan 7, 2017: It's been a while and the review stands as-written. I leave the eco-mode off full time as I've had a few occasions to need to accelerate rapidly and there is simply no time to find that eco button. The lane-departure-warning is wrong more than it's right. The lane-keep-assist requires you to spend more time looking at the dash than the road since it's constantly giving the the can't-see-the-lines-on-the-road-please-take-over warning. Also, the mileage is not even remotely close to what Honda advertised.

Update: Jan 10, 2017: One final thought to consider when purchasing this - or any other - vehicle. Most of my trips are short (less than 10 miles). I just got back from a two day 900 mile trip and discovered something else. The front seats have what I'll call ""wings"" that are sculpted up and inward on the base, and seat back - presumably to provide support, or help keep you in place during an accident. I'm a pretty big guy and on any long trip they tend to put a lot of pressure on your thighs and back. I assumed it was because of my size. My brother, who is as skinny as can be, bought a Lexus with the same style seats. He has a 95 mile daily drive and within 2 weeks he traded in the car because the seats made him uncomfortable. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but you'll only know if it works for you personally if you think about it *consciously* while sitting in the vehicle. It's not something you'll notice on a test drive, but something that you should consider when purchasing ANY vehicle.",neg
"I cannot believe some of these reviewers who just accept that their CRV has a vibration to it. I have owned a lot of new cars in my life and do not accept a vehicle that vibrates as a ""characteristic"". I have taken my issue to CAMVAP (Canadian auto mobile vehicle arbitration) as my wife gets ill from the vibration on long trips. Do not buy this vehicle!",neg
"My 3 year review, same old problems. Car still shakes and stalls when cold.  Not sure why people think Honda is so great. I have a 2014 Acura MDX that I put 3000 into this year and is very expensive to insure. I will never buy another Honda product. I just bought my son a 2017 Subaru Impreza,  we will see how they hold up but I’m done with Honda and their crappie engineering. Also, who thought that blind side camera was a good idea?  I can’t change directions on my gps while I’m drive but I can be blinded at night with that camera. My 2 year update. I still have stalling issues when I back out of my garage.  I will take it into Honda again and I'm sure they will say the same thing that they can't get it to duplicate.  I have called Honda several times and they say this is not an issue. I had a Ford Expedition with close to 200k miles that I now regret getting rid of. I would not recommend a Honda. Also the vibration issue is real and Honda does not care. They act like they have never heard of this. My father had a 1984 VW Rabbit diesel and this engine reminds me of that car.  My 1 year update-  while I still like the car, I have experienced many of the same problems other CRV owners have complained about. The worst problem by far is the CVT transmission. Many days I back the car out of the garage and experience a violent shutter and the car stalls.  I haven't taken it back to the dealer because they will just say we can't get it to do it and it will just add to my frustration but I plan to drop it off when I leave for vacation next month so they can thoroughly test it.  There is a definite shaking when at idle as the car RPM,s adjust up and down.  The first car I drove was an old diesel VW rabbit and this engine is similar in noise but While it's not very Honda like I accepted that during my shopping but just know it doesn't get better if anything it gets louder. Disappointed that Apple Play will not be added. As I said in my original review Japanese car manufacturers have the worst technology but the dealer said it would be added in the next few months. I know a car salesmen who lied shocking. This is my first Honda after mainly Fords. Would I buy another Honda🤔?  Probably not. 

I wanted to give an honest opinion on the Honda CRV after hesitating due to the vibration issue.  I didn't want to spend more than 30k, I wanted AWD, room for 4 adults with space for cargo. I looked at the Rav 4, Forrester, Rogue,Escape and the CX5.  None of them were perfect but the Honda was either as good or better in every area.  As for the vibration issue, I've noticed at a red light, the engine goes into a very low RPM that does provide a slight vibration.  I honestly would not have even noticed it, if not for the negative reviews. This small CUV is roomy,safe,comfortable, good gas mileage and really holds its value. After 1 month and 1,000 miles, I would highly recommend it.",neg
"There are a lot of great things about this car, but there is one showstopper that should prevent you from buying it.  When you are idling at a red light, the car vibrates like one of those funny exercise machines from the 40s.  It also rattles like you wouldn't believe during acceleration. 

This is my 6th Honda and my last.  Honda admits it's an issue, but don't really have anything encouraging to say about a fix.  

My brother opted for the Mazda 5 and he is very happy with it.  If I could exchange this car today, I would.

"Just spent close to 30,000 dollars on my first brand new car and one day into owning it noticed the vibration problem at idle.  I am so disappointed and feel Honda and the dealerships are scamming consumers.  They don't yet have a fix and are not telling potential buyers about this problem.  I would have definitely bought a different car had I read the consumer reviews (not the biased corporate reviews) prior to purchasing.  Having owned a reliable and smooth operating Accord for 13 years, I trusted the brand and the dealership.  A Honda loyalist no more.  Major disappointment.",neg
"I bought my brand new CRV 2015 and got the car in May 2015
Everything is perfect in this car excet this annoying vibration.
I can't understand how Honda is willing to lose their reputation by allowing such a considerable flaw in their best selling SUV.
Tge vibration really frustrates me everytime I drive the car and stop at a stop sign or red signal. I can see tge passenger seat shaking.... I don't know wgat I should do now and how to deal with my car!!!",neg
"The vibrations at a stop while in gear with the brake in is just too much for me to ignore.  Honda will tell you it has something to do with the engine and transmission combo... It simply isn't true.  
Fact 1 - If I am stopped, in drive, with the brake pushed in, the car idle drops and the car vibrates horribly.
Fact 2 - If I am stopped, in drive, with the EMERGECY BRAKE on, and my foot off the brake, the vibration STOPS and the RPMs go up.
I try to tell Honda this has something to do with the power brake system pulling power from the engine, but they won't hear it.  Mark my words, they will figure it out someday, and the issue will be with the power brake system.
Besides the vibration issue the engine is underpowered from a stop. I find myself dropping it into low to get moving sometimes. 
As far as negatives there are two others. First the plastic on the door jam and in the trunk is not of good quality the first time you step on it or slide something across it there will be scratches. My last complaint is with the Bluetooth. When playing songs or podcast the play and pause button on the screen works when they want to. When making phone calls the dial by name feature is terrible. Sometimes I would try to dial by name and it would just dial some random numbers. I just use my phone's dial by name feature which works perfectly now. My overall opinion is that I would not buy another Honda. Despite complaining about the vibration every time I brought it in for service and being assured that I would be called as soon as a fix was made I still have not been called by Honda.
A couple of positive notes... when locking the doors with the key fob there is no horn sound. There is just a nonintrusive tone that sounds and even that can be turned off. Also, after 25 months of use I just got my first warning that my key fob battery was getting weak. The notice was displayed on the dash and was much appreciated since it would have been very inconvenient to have the battery die and find out the hard way.",neg

"This car is my headache since I bought in 2015.  A lot of problems like engine stop suddenly while you are driving; a badly squeeze sound from some where cannot be found by Honda dealership in Montclair, CA, also includes vibration. In this February, dealership told me they can fix the vibration by updating software. They did and vibration degree reduced to be endured. Recently 2015 Honda CR-V recalled for engine CVT problem, I sent my car back to dealership, and was told after updating the software, the vibration problem can be fixed completely. But I disappointed again, the vibration problem comes back, that means it is vibration again like one year ago when I bought this CRV! I hate this kind of vibration which make me irritated while I am driving on the road. So Honda should stop its advertisement "" the best car of 2016"" to mislead customers.


I just bought car in March, and one week late I found the car has vibration problem, and felt a slight jump on the freeway if the car in high speed. I reported this problem to dealership and Honda Headquarter, they said it is under investigation, but without time frame. This problem not only happened on my car. Honda knows this, but they don't want to solve this. They keep saying no safety issue. From Honda's attitude to this problem, who will believe them, and how we can trust them!!! Why we should buy a NEW car with problems! Why should we be suffered by the vibration while driving on the freeway?! Why should we pay a NEW car price to get a defeat car?! It is not fair to customers!",neg
"This update was done on October 18, 2017
Soon after I purchased the Cr-V I had a terrible vibration in the transmission area which radiated throughout the vehicle. It took over two years and many complaints to have it ""corrected"". Both Honda and the dealer had a myriad of excuses. Here are the two best. 1. ""It is inherent in the vehicle design"" 2. ""It is just Harmonic Distortion"". It feels like the vibration may be returning. The dealer made the repair but I was told that Honda never issued a Technical Service Bulletin to owners, there should have been a recall. The vibration affected the engine to the point where it stalled several times while I was pulling away from red lights. 
Like most SUV class vehicles, it is neither sporty or utilitarian. It's OK for carrying groceries but if you want to tote anything larger than a bread box or a piece of lumber more than 6' long, forget it. You would be better off spending 30 grand  a small passenger/ cargo van from Mercedes Benz.
I don't like the all touch screen radio it are distracting and hard to use. The audio quality is just OK. The USB ports are located in the console, they work fine but the location is a pain, if you use the console for storage.I do like the rear facing passenger side camera. It illuminates the info screen when the right turn signal is engaged. Can't figure why they omitted the driver side.
This is the first Honda I have owned. It's a plain middle of the road vehicle. Nothing special and I was surprised at Honda's attitude toward a problem that was very common in the 2015 models.  I will see how it holds up, but will be shopping next Spring.",neg

The vibration problem is real.

Stay away form the CRV until Honda fixes the problem. ",neg

. They are investigating the issue and will advise when and if a product upgrade is available.

I am glad they are working on this but disappointed they released a model which to me is seriously flawed.  We've had ours since November and the vibration issue has gradually worsened.  I do not enjoy driving the vehicle.",neg

"I, like many others, have major issues with vibrations (mostly at idle). I was told by my dealership that I ""was the only one"" that complained of this. However, I went online and see it is indeed a problem with the 2015s in general, not my vehicle. I hope Honda does a recall soon to fix this or I will never buy a Honda again (and neither will my family and friends who experienced the vibrations in my car).

"I bought 2015 CRV LX AWD in mid of Jan, 2015. I started feeling the vibration from the beginning. I reported the same to Honda Technical Support and the dealer. But couldn't get any attention from them. Finally I took the vehicle to Honda Service and they confirmed it is a known technical issue in 2015 CRV for which Honda has no fix yet.
I complained Honda again but didn't get any solution. They don't bother once the car is sold. I will never by any Honda car in future. Don't by Honda CRV 2015 CVT model. This is a defective car and no support from Honda.",neg
"Bought in December 10 2014. After a 2 block test drive I really liked it. After purchase I noticed a vibration in the seats and between1000 and 2000  rpm and a droning noise. Thought that was the way a 4 cyl. was supposed to be since I have always drivin 6 cyl. Well  I looked online and omg! This is not what is normal prior CRV' s . Honda is telling thousands a fix is coming, if a fix is needed for a new car how can you sell them knowing there is an issue, Honda calls it an issue, to a consumer its a problem! Honda uses the word issue to downplay it. Look out Honda! You tricked the wrong person. Imagine your an ant, all others are stepping on you to kill ya, well I'm a 20 lb sledge.. Fix it!",neg
"I am not one to complain about small things, but the vibration felt in my new 2015 CR-V detracts from all the other positives in this vehicle!  The vibration only occurs once the car is warmed up and is so bad that it makes the sunglasses on my face vibrate!  

I have never written an online review for anything, but I felt that others should know about this major flaw.

If Honda is able to fix this issue, then I would recommend this car.  Otherwise, I would not.

Hugely disapppointed in this purchase.",neg
"We owned this vehicle for one day when I said to my husband, ""this car needs to be tuned.""  We brought it back to the dealer and they said they could not do anything.   Honda did not have a fix.  We test drove the car when it was cold out -- it did not vibrate.  When the car warms up -- the vibrations are so bad that I do not like driving the car.  Don't buy this car until they fix the problem.  I have been waiting 4 months ...no fix yet.",neg
"I just purchased a CR-V EX model yesterday. After I got the CR-V from the dealer, I immediately found that the passenger seat vibrated at idle with in D drive position when air condition is off. You cannot find this in your test driving since the dealer occupied the passenger during the test drive.  Do all 2015 CR-V have this passenger problem?

The other is that I bought the car for the advertised MPG and it is a huge disappointment.  I have never seen more than 28 mpg highway driving from Baltimore to Virginia on open highway.  I average only 17-20 city on short drives. A family member gets better mileage in an ACADIA. I drove a new Nissan Sentra for a month (with a CVT) and it was smooth compared to the Vibrator.

"I've had my car for exactly one week and I am completely disappointed. This is my third Honda and is my last Honda.
Vibration and shuddering after it warmed up and really terrible at idle (stop on D). The vibration is very noticeable on passenger seat without passenger.
The posted MPG is not true. The MPG from Honda website is 26 city/33 highway/28 combined mpg rating for AWD models. Currently mine is only 23.3 mpg combined (driving a little more city than highway).
The heater is weak and has trouble keeping up in cold weather. The back seat takes very long time to get warm. This is really a problem for me because I have kids sitting in the back seat.

"I had a great 2009 CRV AWD LX until I purchased this 2015 CRV AWD LX a few days ago.  There is vibration in the steering wheel while driving.  As I read reviews today, I see that other customers have reported this 2015 CRV vibrates.  The service staff at the dealership told me that the 2nd gear is ""slow"" and once out of this gear, the car will no longer vibrate, and that Honda is aware of the problem, but is unable to fix this problem at this time.  I wish I was told about this problem before I purchased it.  The salesperson told me today that he was unaware of this issue.  The dealership has been very helpful so far.   ",neg
"At this point I would not recommend this vehicle.

Let me state first this is my third Honda. My first two were a civic and a CRV. Held each from 12-15 years. I couldn't say enough about the quality and service from Honda. Repeatedly recommended
them to friends and co-workers.

But this 2015 CRV has serious issues with the vibration coming through the steering column.
The best description is if the driver side tire is bad. The vibration is very noticeable in the steering wheel. Then somewhat
in the seat.

Didn't I notice while test driving? I tested the 2014. Ready to buy then I heard the about the improved 2015's coming out. With winter I bought the car too quick. Big mistake.

I took the suv for the second time when the miles at 3200 because the vibration getting worse. I did not put on park at service center, just left on D. I called the service consultant including the manager to feel the vibration. Everyone agreed, but when I went to pick up the suv they did not fix the issue said ""this is the characteristic of the new CR-V"". They even gave me in writing. UNBELIVABLE AND VERY DISAPPOINTED.

"My father just Bought a 2015 HONDA CRV Touring model which is their highest end. The interioir and exterior design are great. However, the ENGINE FAILED after having it only 3 days. The car was bran new and came off the lot with less than 7 miles on it. We traded in our 2014 CRV which we loved for this new lemon. Now we are fighting for a refund to get our old car back but they are not letting us return it. It has now been 10 days.

We noticed vibration in the vehicle at medium speeds (30-50mph) and then some studdering at stop signs and red lights. Turns out there is something wrong with the engine. When we brought the car back they were not surprised, we  are not the first to report this",neg

The hesitation/vibration problem is noticeable (intermittent shuddering as if a wheel is out of alignment and/or the vehicle has just hit a patch of black ice, but related to the newly designed CRV transmission, a problem common to all CRV 2015 that does not yet have a fix) but what really stunned me was a sudden EXTREMELY HIGH REV when going down a small hill. I was braking lightly at the time. It happened again a week later going up a small hill without brake.  It didn't last very long, but the engine raced so completely out of control that the vehicle did not feel safe.  The noise was incredible. I returned the car to the dealership.",neg

"Buyer beware.  There is a major flaw with the transmission on the new CRV.  The dealer and Honda have said that they know it is there, but they have no idea how to fix it.  At a stop with foot on brake the car vibrates terribly.  It feels as if it will die on the spot.  And it is bad enough to rattle your bones.  Google Vibration in 2015 CRV to see how bad this is across the country! It does not instill confidence in the rest of the car.  Although Honda and the dealer sympathize, they are offering no help in getting it fixed.  When you buy a new car you expect it to be flawless.

When I test drive the CRV, I tried all the functions in the car, and they seems to be pretty good, I got a good deal on the price, and i bought it.  However after i drive it everyday from home to work, and i live in New York.  I have to deal with stop signs or traffic lights every couple blocks.  The car just vibrates like crazy when i'm in D mode and brake pressed.  The shake is pretty violent, and after i research everyone is having the same issue.

Dealer checked it with other new 2015 models and confirmed that this is with all Honda CRV 2015 Models. I reported the same to American HOnda and they told me GET LOST.
The vibration is not always but few times but is strong that you can literally feel it at the back.
Very sad that HONDA put my feedback under the carpet and washed off their hands with there responsibility. I told them that the vibration is so strong that my driving get distracted and I get a feel of discomfort but they did not listen to me and closed my case :-(",neg

"Since purchasing the vehicle in September 2016, it was seen in the service department in October 2016 for a loud click from the brake (told this is normal) and the vehicle shutting off during idle twice. An update was done but the issue continued. November 2016, I brought the vehicle in because the back seat would move back and forth if someone was not sitting in it (they had to replace the whole back seat) but as I was driving into the service doors the vehicle skipped and tried to die with lights flashing on the dash. Service could not duplicate. December 2016 brought in because the vehicle kept skipping when trying to take off from a stop. On two occasions it completely stalled but service was unable to duplicate. The vehicle also had issues with shifting too early at times and then shifting was delayed other times. Once again issue could not be duplicated. Later in December I brought it back again and was told there was a fix. January 2017 the vehicle was brought back again due to stalling and the multiair actuator was replaced. The issue continued as the service manager searched for an answer until I had enough in October 2017 when it came to a stop for no reason and the vehicle would make a terrible noise in reverse at times. Service along with FCA attempted to fix it but could not duplicate the issue. When I received the vehicle back it now skips in idle, makes a lawn mower sound in idle and when shutting off make a whining noise. I have stopped driving the vehicle and am trying to get FCA to do the right thing via Georgia's Lemon Law. I have done my due diligence following FCAs required steps and they said they cannot duplicate my issue but would give me a good faith payment for my time. I have asked to talk to supervisors etc. but am told that is not their protocol. This vehicle is unsafe and should not be allowed on the road!  I have video of the issues and one of the service agents commented on it having delayed shifting but FCA closed my case and said it is fixed, regardless of the fact you cannot fix an issue that cannot be duplicated. I sent my Lemon Law paperwork over 1 week ago certified mail and now USPS want to send it back because FCA hasn’t come to pick it up. I will not drive my children around in the vehicle and I will never buy another Chrysler product. I love my dealership but FCA has no business making cars.",neg

"Being in the military with limited income keeps my options low in regards to what I can afford for car payments.  I just got married and my wife just found a job in the Seattle area so we needed a 2nd car.  After looking at used vehicles, we came across Jeep's President's Day sale and they were offering $5K rebates for downpayment plus discounting the sticker price for all basic Cherokee Sport models. So we were actually paying less than what we were looking at for used Cherokees.  I wasn't impressed with the acceleration but it is a 4 cyl. My wife liked the features and it was new! So we pulled the trigger. 500 miles into the car, we realized there was puddling water at driver and passenger sides.  It was storming so I asked if her door was shut.  It was.  We drove it back to our dealer who proceeded to hold onto it for over a week.  Not once did they contact us.  We had to initiate the discussion and they seemed upset that we were upset.  A response of ""that's why there's a warranty"" doesn't comfort a consumer when the cause was a body part that needed to be welded shut, seals in the door and windshield that needed to be replaced/resealed.  It simply shows shoddy workmanship and low grade parts quality.",neg
"We purchased in Sept. 2016  We had looked at several comparable vehicles but decided to go with the Jeep due to pricing.  That was a mistake.  You get what you pay for.  It was inexpensive, because in simple terms it stinks.  From the very beginning it has burned excessive amounts of oil.  We took to the dealership and were told that a quart of oil every 1,000 miles is normal.  Well, that's not normal in my opinion for a brand new vehicle.  I have an 11 year old Chevrolet that does not come close to burning that much oil.  We were advised to check the oil every time we fill up with gas.  What a joke.  They performed an oil consumption test which resulted in them telling us they would send the findings to the manufacturer.  We called several times to check status of the oil consumption findings only to be told that they hadn't heard back from the manufacturer.  Two weeks ago, while driving the Jeep in rush hour traffic the engine light started flashing and service transmission light came on and car went into limp mode.  I was almost rear ended because car wouldn't move.  I was finally able to slowly move over 3 lanes and pull into a parking lot.  I shut the car off and once I restarted it, it seemed to be fine.  I got back on the road only to have this happen 3 more times before I could make it to my destination.  The dealership was contacted only to not return our calls.  We took the car in the next morning and haven't seen or heard from the dealership since.  My advice - DO NOT BUY A JEEP.  WORST CAR I'VE EVER OWNED.",neg

The gas pedal has a wobble when I'm stopped and then accelerate to take off, but it doesn't happen every time. Scary! When I Googled it, it has something to do with the transmission needs to be tightened. Oh! and my tires keep losing air! Constantly putting air in the tires!

"I own the 2016 Trailhawk V6 3.2L engine with tow package. Mango Tango! It was love at first sight; a work of art with unsurpassed comfort! But it's been just one year (14K miles) and I no longer feel safe in it, nor can I count on it to get me to my destination. Today, I write this review from my back deck when I should be enjoying my camping vacation, however for the 4th time in a 6 week period, the car completely shut itself down. Twice in the last few weeks the car has just shut itself off, requiring me to pull over. Each time it restarted after a few minutes. Thank goodness it was always where I could pull over. Today however, packed for my vacation, camper in tow, traveling 65mph EVERYTHING shut down: the electronics and the transmission. Dead as a doornail. No power brakes, no power steering. Nothing. Roadside assistance sucks. It took two hours for them to get a wrecker to me, but refused to take it to my local dealership, a whopping 4 miles further than the ""closest"" Jeep dealership, and made me abandon my camper. Furthermore they told me they would not get me home from the dealership they were willing to tow to (placing me 85 miles from home). So I paid the wrecker guy the FOUR MILE difference to take the car to my local dealer and my son-in-law rescued the pop up. I can't say enough for the service guys at my local dealership who did a diagnostic on the car first thing the following morning (Monday) to try and get me back on the road, but they could not replicate the issue and returned my car to me. :( I guess I'm stuck driving a $40K safety risk until this happens again, and again. Here are a few other things that annoy me about this car: the cruise control is a joke. Unless you are on flat land, it will take off on you going down hill as though it isn't engaged. I've had the car bolt from 55 to 68mph of its own volition. You can't turn off the radio; you have to mute the volume every time you get in the car if you don't want to listen. Bluetooth connects sporadically and often can't send messages or takes several minutes to respond. If your iPod/iPhone is connected to a USB port for charging, you can't get it to run through the speakers for music. I just paid $3K for the extended service plan; looks like I'll be needing it.  This vehicle has a history of issues. ITS TIME CHRYSLER DOES SOMETHING ABOUT IT; 3 MODEL YEARS IS ENOUGH!

This car was a nightmare, the windshield wipers shut off on the highway in a torrential downpour more than once, the drivers side window would get stuck in the down position and it had to go to the dealer to be fixed more than once. The back up camera only worked half the time, on top of that when I had enough of this pc of crap and decided to trade it in with 16,000 miles the car was worth 1/2 of what i paid for it. The depreciation on this vehicle is horrible. I did not just take the dealers offer on the trade in. The Kelly blue book also shows the value is 50% after 1 year. My grand Cherokee was 5 years old and over 50K miles and I got 60% of its purchase value at trade in. DO NOT buy this vehicle unless you plan to keep it forever and pray it doesn't wind up at the dealer for problems every month.

"My wife and I recently had a baby and decided to turn in my old Jeep Liberty for a 2016 Jeep Cherokee Latitude.  The thought was to get the baby into a nice, safe and smooth ride.  This car has been terrible.  The dealership and service area have been absolutely horrendous, but that's not what you guys care about.  I have had this car for six months and have had to bring it in for service 4 times,  not including the windshield wiper recall.  They have had to replace the radio system 3 times.  The touch screen and radio continue to black out which does not let me control the heating vent system, radio and rear view back up camera.  When I hit 30 MPH the back up camera goes on while driving forward.  The radio is in and out when this happens, not that I can control it.  This happened during the recent snow storms in Southern Maine and I was not able to select my rear and front defrosters as the buttons did not work on top of the touch screen.  Luckily when the radio and touch screen went it was already on these settings.  Currently still in the shop now while they are adding a new radio.   I also had to have my right signal repaired because it went out after 2 months.  They think it was actually the wiring connecting to the light.  took them 2 hours to figure it out. The interior is nice,but poor vision around corners due to the frame.  Smooth ride, but the 4 cyclinder is a little sluggish.  Actually impressed with handling in the snow.  But, I asked for options to replace the jeep from the dealer and they said to call Chrysler and complain as that's my best course of action or they could have me trade it back into them for a new Jeep but I they said I would have to pay more for it.

"When the vehicle was new, we were very happy with it. It wasn't until we were stranded for 3 hours do to a transmission failure with 10,500 miles on the vehicle that we found out just how unreliable it would be. The Jeep was towed to a local Jeep dealer for repair. They provided excellent service by the way; five computer modules were upgraded and the problem appeared to be corrected. A day later, the problem reappeared, died while on a highway, and the vehicle went back to the shop. This time they determined that it would need a valve on the transmission that had failed. 
The unreliability of a vehicle with only 10,500 miles made me very nervous for the future. My wife and I were visiting Florida at the time and the thought of driving 1,400 miles to get home to upstate New York with a vehicle that could shut down any time during the trip prompted us to trade the vehicle immediately. To make matters worse, we lost half the value of the purchase price by trading a 9 month old vehicle, but felt that we had no choice!

On the highway you felt like you were constantly going over speed bumps. The radio was BAD.  You couldn't hear the sound because of the thumping of the speaker against the dash.  The air conditioner kept making noise.  I could hear the engine when the vehicle was sitting at a light or when we were on the road.  Now the UGLY:  NOISE FATIGUE:  Please stop the noise.  It never stops.  The radio makes ugly noise, the tires make noise, the air conditioner makes noise.  I'm tire of the noise.  I can hear other vehicles passing by.  I can't hear the radio with all the noise.  I'm giving this vehicle up as soon as I can.  There, I'm tired.",neg
"I love this Jeep but it has had problems. Within the first year, the entire air compressor unit went out had to replace it. Also, a cylinder stopped working and needed new spark plugs and maintenance on malfunctions. It is too bad it is falling apart mechanically within a year. Note that if you get the 4 cylinder the acceleration is terrible.",neg
"So , after a year they asked me to update my review 

I hate this car !!!!! 

1) I average about 15 miles to the gallon 

2) still having weird transmission problems , a hunk of crap 

3) repair guy at Jeep confides in me and tells me he feels sorry  for people that buy Cherokee’s 

4) it’s a piece of crap and Uconnect is terrible lol omg. Half the time to get it to connect is a wrestling match.  If you use an iPhone , it sucks. Better for people with droids 

If you want to see my original review. Read on 



Wow , What a huge dissapointment, was really excited and bought a 2016 trail hawk with the 6 cycl engine 
Heres how owning one has gone (FYI i only have had it 3 weeks )

Week 1, computer froze with rear camera stuck on and blaring latin oompah music ,,,,,,,brought it back to the dealer for repair ,,,,they said dust got in the computer? 

Week 2 , brought it in for a computer update .......

Week 3 ,,,,transmission froze up while driving into neutral , couldn't get it out of neutral , had it towed to the dealers ( Santa Monica ) and its been sitting there for 3 days and nobody has even looked at it  yet 

What can I tell you ,,,its a huge disappointment , jeep dosen't seem to care.... its been in the shop more than I've actually driven it ,,,,,wish I would have bought something elese and the dealer is NO help whats ever !!!!!!!!!!!! #hunkofjunk #jeepcrap",neg
"My 2016 Jeep Cherokee has under 3K miles on it and it is a lemon.  It has a water leak that causes floorboards to be soaked.  Vehicle has been at dealership four times for this issue (currently still there).   Each time they return the car to me they say they have sealed this or that and water tested. Each time the leak has quickly returned.  I opened a case (#29199176) with Jeep/Chrysler.  I want my money back.  I am concerned about  corrosion and long-term reliability issues with the vehicle. I worry about mold affecting my family's health.  I want my money back so that I may buy a different vehicle and Move on.  I do not have time in my life for this drama.  I am super busy with high stress job, kids and a frail mother suffering from dementia.  The last thing I need is an unreliable car which is why I purchased a new vehicle.  I felt the jeep would be easier for my mom to get in and out of but clearly I should have gone with another SUV.  So far I am underwhelmed by the response I am getting from Jeep/Chrysler.  What a pain!!!

"First of all after purchasing this car I feel like the stupidest person alive. I assumed there would be a spare tire or at least a donut which there is none, all you get is a tire pump filled with a one time use sealant where the spare should be. You think i would've checked before buying. The Uconnect voice commands only understand you 5% of the time, worthless. I purchased the Lifetime Warranty, which i assumed would be forever as long as I'm in ownership of the vehicle and breathing. This is not the case the Lifetime warranty becomes void as soon as the repair cost becomes more than the vehicles value at the time, I figure 10-12 years according to what i see on Blue Book Values, not to mention deductibles on warranty repairs which greatly affects warranty price. Last but not least, bring a calculator with you on any new car purchase and take the time to recalculate the dealers figures, mine offered me $1000 trade-in on my hunk of junk without even seeing it, which now that i think about it. He probably gave me nothing and made it seem like he did. Live and learn. I have only owned this for 3 days, so i don't know very much on performance and reliability, but from what I've seen so far, I think i'm in for a very bumpy road ahead. My first choice was a 2016 Hyundai Tucson, should've went back.",neg
"I bought a Liberty brand new in 2005 and LOVE it to this day. It was time to replace my husband's car, so the Cherokee seemed like the closest to the Liberty we coukd find.  It is not.

A Jeep in name only, we discovered the backseat has far less head room- I am 6'1"" and my head is mashed against the ceiling.  We have a toddler, and there is only about 5"" clearance from the carseat to the ceiling- getting him in and out is very difficult.  This is not a vehicle for you if you need to use carseats!!! 

As much as I LOVE my Liberty, I am so disappointed in the Cherokee.  After only 5 days I am asking O'Brien to take it back.

This is not an SUV, but a station wagon or ""crossover"" at best.  MAJOR BUYER'S REMORSE.

May 25th update:  I had to take it in after only two months due to a loud creaking in the front end.  They had to replace driver's side suspension. When I asked why it already failed the service manager said it probably came off the line faulty.  Not a good feeling for a brand new suv you paid $30k for.

The accerlation has gotten worse and is so lethargic I was almost tboned in traffic when it hesitated on me, even after I put the pedal to the floor. Not responsive even with the auto shutdown turned off.

June 9th update:  back in the shop AGAIN.  Still lethargic acceleration and gear shifting continues to be labored + sunroof ""clinking"" when open  and I hit bumps in the road.  After one day they said they did another software update and replaced two faulty seals.  The sunroof still clinks, but at a lower note than before.  I continued to email and call the sales manager and the general manager, but no response for over two more weeks.  Until today: the sales manager says he didn't get my emails or voicemails for some reason.  He suggested I turn off the auto off button, which I have already done weeks ago, every single time I get in the car.  I responded that I had already tried that and I continue to want to return the vehicle.  They are now willing to discuss returning it but I have little faith that I won't lose my shirt on it - $4500 down and I've paid two months at $435.  Meanwhile, they will reusel it at $29k and lose nothing.  WORST DECISION OF MY LIFE.  I will never buy another Jeep.",neg
"This is for the 2016 Limited 3.2 pkg.  Shopped the market segment (Ford Escape, Dodge Journey) and ended with this as a 2-year lease as our daily driver.  The Cherokee fits into a needed niche for SUV folks:  small enough to park and maneuver easily, but large enough (inside) to not feel like a compact SUV (like the Escape).  The leather interior is soft and supple, yet rugged.   Complaints:  (1) where's the inside rear hatch release button?  Please, FCA:  tell me there is one (on a $36,000-MSRP vehicle).  There's apparently only one way to open the rear hatch and that's by feeling around with your middle three fingers under the rear portion of the hatch door and depressing a 4"" wide, flush with the surrounding surface, release ""button"".  And to further compound the annoyance of this feature, the locking mechanism (that locks all 5 doors) is nearby, so if you hit the wrong button you have to pull the key FOB out and start all over;  (2) the ""auto stop"" SUCKS!  I didn't research this vehicle enough before selecting it and had I known about that ""feature"" it definitely would have deterred my interest in going this route.  Imagine stopping for a few seconds, seeing your tach go to zero, then transitioning quickly between the brake and gas pedal and incurring a ""clunk"" as the Cherokee engages and moves ahead.  Plus, it defaults to auto-stop every time you start the vehicle, so it requires you to remember to defeat it manually.  To me, it's utterly ridiculous--to force the shut down of the vehicle in a (vain) effort to increase the fleet MPG for FCA.  I'll be curious to see how many trans issues Jeep will face in the future as the wear and tear related to that very noticeable jerking between stop and take off shaves miles off the already precarious transmission in these vehicles.  Bottom Line:  'So glad I leased instead of purchasing.  Already looking forward to the lease-end, relieved I don't have to find another sucker for this vehicle to sell it to.",neg
I guess we win. transmission crapped out after only 265mi. yes thats right 265! All the things everyone is saying about this vehicle are true. Run dont walk away from this. Luckily we were not on highway when it failed. Dont listen to dealer lies. They know about transmission problems and are not able to fix them. Gonna have to take a huge loss to get out from this junk. Lemon law is our only hope.    Update. Dealer couldn't figure out how to fix this vehicle. Luckily we got them to take it back from us for a minimal loss. I feel bad for the next person they sell this to!  This 9 speed tranny is a joke.,neg
"I bought the 2016 Cherokee Sport, it sounds like a diesel powered sewing machine, according to the dealer its normal.. yeah you heard it right.. A 2016 Jeep sounds like a 92 Chevy Cavalier only the Cavalier has more power and sounds better!! not to mention the headlights get a lot of moisture in them ""dealer said that's normal too"" < because you want a brand new car with rusted headlight connectors right?!?..  this vehicle is a joke!! You hit the gas and it takes a good 3 seconds to start moving. The MPG is around 13 to 14, not what the manufacturer says and that's driving like an old lady. Very Unhappy with it and will NOT buy another Jeep unless its a 90's model that's the only time they got it right!!",neg
"I have a new 2016 Jeep Cherokee Latitude with 1200 miles on it. I noticed a noise coming from my engine at a traffic light and I thought it was the car behind me but when I turned the radio down I discovered it was coming from my new Jeep. When you turn the radio down you can here a ticking sound which sounds like a helicopter propeller. Very Annoying for a Brand new Vehicle. I went to the dealership and let the service manager drive it with me and he heard the same noise. Then he asked the mechanic to go with me and he heard the same noise. I had taken it back to the dealership to have them diagnose and they said that it was a Purge Solenoid Valve and they replaced it. But when they called me to pick it up they said that it was still making the noise and probably will stay that way until Jeep comes out with a replacement part or a recall. Really!!! You pay $30,000 for a new Jeep and you get this kind of noise. I have owned a lot of other Vehicles over the years and the Engines have always been quiet with the radio turned down and you did not even know they were running. The Engineers at Jeep need to take a look at this because it is unacceptable in my book and not up to standards. Unless someone likes listening to this noise I guess you will be ok with it. But when you test drive I would listen for this noise before you buy. The Dealer started more of the Jeeps on the lot and they all made this noise and he told me this is the way Jeep has made them. I did call the Jeep Service Center and all they could tell me is that they would make documentation of it. We all know where that is going! Maybe the CEO of Jeep should get in the car with me for a test drive and listen to the noise and see if he likes listening to it. You think they would have discovered this before they came off of the assembly line. 
Not so Sincerely!

"Do not buy this car.  When you put it in gear you never know if it will go forward or backwards no matter what gear it is in.  It will not start, the door will come down on you head and knock you out, the tire pressure gauge alternates between okay and low, and the dealer will flash the computer about fifteen to twenty times and the car will still not work.  I will never , never, never, buy another Jeep.  Also I had the worst dealership.  When I called about my car during the 6 weeks they kept the car during the first 3 months of ownership I was told that nobody in the shop know anything.  I had to take off work to talk to the shop about the status of my car.  they thought is was okay to sell me that loaner car at the same price of my Jeep which was about $10,000 less than my Jeep. Usually drive about 20,000 per year but I am afraid to drive this car!  Plan to sell as soon as possible!  Paid much more than it was worth.

Bought a new car and it was so much better the Jeep.  The Jeep  turns off when you stop at a light and turns back on when you touch the accelerator.  Several months before I bought a new car the Jeep did not turn on when I touched the accelerator. That was a bad feeling in the middle of the intersection.

New car is so much better and now I feel safe driving!",neg
"the head lights are extremely poor on pittsburgh roads (hills). low beam has no for a short distance. there is a line that cannot be seen above. it is dark. high bean has very limited range. the heater/air condition is lousy. while warm air appears quickly it is inconsistent. feels like either warm is present but once it gets to temperature cool air blows. same happens when using the ac. the cabin temp is either hot or cool, no uniformity. just poor ride quality.  driver seating control affords poor comfort. the transmission is annoying while coasting to a stop it constantly downshifts then up again within a few feet travel. up and down, up and down, continuously. this happens even when locked into 3rd or 2nd. or this maybe the torque converter lock and unlocking. very poor engine braking again when downshift and locked. no room in back seat. overall glad i leased.",neg
"Loved this 2015 JEEP Cherokee Trailhawk for the first few months, then the recalls started to roll in. Oh, and still going to the dealership for the same recall fix (tomorrow will be the third time getting the back liftgate fixed, that won't latch/lock). 

Even though I went in under the warranty/recall to get things fixed, and they weren't fixed properly, so I'm back in Service Dept – now that I'm out of the warranty. they won't give me a rental car (not the dealership, not JEEP)! 

New favorite issue with the JEEP is when I'm sitting at a light and it's about to shut off because it's not getting enough gas perhaps. You guessed it, another fix that I already brought to the dealership to get done. Round 2 tomorrow.

Our JEEP from the 1990s is running better than this POS.  Not buying another (new) JEEP.",neg
"The transmission is horrible and the dealership says it is as designed and make no effort to correct the problem.  Our 16 year old was driving it and at times it would lurch foreword for no reaso, it is an accident waiting to happen.  The shift lever is easy to bump and if a passenger turns to the back seat it is easy to knock it from drive to neutral.  There is no lockout.  The fuel mileage is horrible, worse than my Challenger 5.7 Hemi, and the stall feature at stops is dangerous considering when you start the transmission can lurch foreword.  The Navigstion is inaccurate and inferior to the Dodge as is the entertainment package.  The Cargo area is small and the seats uncomfortable.  The car is a nuicense and a safety hazard and resale shows how poor the car is.  We just traded it in on a Chevy because, in my opinion,  it is too dangerous to drive.  This car also has unending recalls resulting in uncompensated lost work and expense taking it to an uncaring dealer.",neg
"This car is flashy, and has some really cool features I'm and out, but looks aren't everything. I've had my 2015 Cherokee for less than a year and I'm on the hunt for a new car. The transmission constantly slips, slamming into gear, and I'm just waiting for the day that it finally dies. In addition to the transmission slowly going out, now the electronics in my instrument cluster are going out! A two year old car shouldn't have any of these problems. What a hunk of junk!",neg
The transmission will not go into park about 50% of the time.  Since it doesn't always do it it is easy to continually make the mistake of thinking park=park then backing up a few inches before realizing it.  This 'feature' killed someone so they recalled and instead of fixing transmission (and admitting flaw) they added a feature where your car cannot back up with the door open.  So it still happens but can't kill you.  The 'capless' gas tank doesn't work at 75% of gas stations and I had to hold the black rubber pressure catch on gas nozzle to pump gas.  Nearly every time I got gas.  The performance of the vehicle is nice but these other items ruined the entire experience of driving every time I got behind the wheel.  Additionally the AC makes constant noise like there is an issue with the freon but was told ' just kind of happens' by the dealership.  Traded it in last week for a VW GTI and am soooo glad even though I lost thousands on value on the Jeep.  LEMON,neg
"I bought my 2015 Jeep Latitude brand new and have had more issues with it than I have with my older 2009 toyota corrolla that has 155k miles on it! I have had to take my jeep in 3 times for transmission and computer problems when it nearly caused an accident on the highway and left me stranded on a separate occurrence. Now the dang thing won't start and it's not the battery, I have a feeling its the alternator. When you buy a brand new car you should have at least 5 years of NO mechanical issues but I have had nothing but these costly issues since owning it. My warranty no longer covers the bumper to bumper and I have even reached out to the manufacturer after learning that I was not the only person experiencing these issues with this type & model but yet there is no recall (I guess because no one has died yet-sad I know but we all know how this works) and they wouldn't do a dang thing about it, not a single thing! Now I have to figure out what I am going to do so that I am not so upside down in payments should I trade it in.",neg
"At 22k miles while I was on my way to a relay race with the car packed with all my gear, it died on the side of the highway.  With no warning (thankfully I was in the slow lane already), as I pushed on the accelerator the car decelerated and came to a stop on the side of the road with ""service transmission"" error showing up. They told me that the cylinder head melted - no explanation as to how/why that happened as of now.  I have kept up with all recalls, maintenance at my local dealer.  After nearly 3 weeks in a dealer for repair, it is ""fixed"".  Though I am concerned about this happening again and will not be buying out my lease.  Also, read the warranty carefully when you buy/lease a new vehicle as Chrysler does not include a rental for any warranty repair work!  I really lucked out that the dealership provided me with a loaner or I would have been without a car for 3 weeks!  And the support from Jeep/Chrysler is a joke.  They assigned a ""case worker"" to help with the warranty process and all she does is make phone calls on my behalf.",neg
"I purchased a 2015 Jeep Cherokee Altitude Edition. The Jeep had 4,500 miles on it when purchased and was owned by the dealership. The Jeep was only 6 months old when I purchased it. I purchased this vehicle for my wife for dependability and weather since we live in Pennsylvania where seasons vary. After one year I received a phone call that my wife was broken down on the turn pike and the car stalled out. We had it towed to the nearest repair shop. It simply ran out of oil. No leaks, no nothing. Just burned through it. I topped it off, and noticed it burned over 1 quart every 1,000 miles. Ended up taking it to the dealership and had an oil consumption test. I was not expecting them to tell me I needed a new engine, but that was exactly what they said. Engine had severe scorn marks. Took 4 weeks for the engine to be installed, provided a rental. It was covered under warranty. I got the Jeep back two days ago and it is back at the dealership because of a very loud humming noise coming from it as I drive it. After this is repaired we are strongly considering getting rid of the Jeep and trading it in and never purchasing a Cherokee with a 2.4 mopar engine ever again. Engine replaced at 24,800 miles. First sign of damage was around 19,700 miles. Took 3 weeks to schedule an oil consumption test. Only reason why I feel it deserves two stars instead of one is because of the hospitality I have received from the dealership.",neg
My car is only two years old and I have had more fixes and issues than I did with my previous used vehicle but yet I purchased this one brand new. I gave this a very horrible review due to the fact that I do not feel safe while in my vehicle since I don't feel safe about even having my own family in my vehicle than why should anything else matter regarding the car. I had just returned home from a 2 hour drive when my transmission decided to go out for the second time. Thank goodness that I was on a surface street at the time and not still on the freeway. Imagine what could of happened to me and my whole family had it happened on the freeway. I am done with this company. I'm sure the dealership will be telling me it's an update that is needed when I just took my car in for an oil change 3 weeks ago.,neg
"UPDATE: I have had to take it into the shop 3x now. The most recent was the compressor stopped working. Less than 20k miles.
Please do not buy this steaming pile of dog poo on wheels.  My dream was always to own a jeep because I had only heard good things about the brand.  My husband and I needed a larger vehicle before we welcomed our amazing daughter into the world. The 2015 Jeep Cherokee was the perfect vehicle for a very very short time.  This hunk of junk has 15k miles on it now and all of sudden we have a whole host of problems; The jeep well not accelerate for a good 15 to 20 seconds after you hit the gas, the radio/display will not turn on when you turn on the vehicle, bluetooth will not connect, parking brake engages by itself.  For your safety, i urge you not to by this ""jeep"".",neg
"Sincerely disappointed in the performance of my 2015 Jeep Cherokee Limited V6 engine. I purchased the car brand new in July 2015 and immediately experienced problems with a rattling/squeaking panorama sunroof and rusting of the paint on the hood of the brand new car. Repairs were made on both by a local Chrysler/Jeep/Dodge service station, where an employee informed me ""the sunroof rattled because all Jeep parts (with the exception of the Jeep Grand Cherokee ones) are made with the cheapest parts they can get, and that's why they rattle."" This should have been a warning flag because this conversation occurred only 5 weeks after ownership. Time went on and the rattling/squeaking sunroof came back, the speakers rattled a low volumes (again an indication of poorly manufactured parts) and I starting experiencing new problems where the check engine light would come on and spontaneously go off, and issues with the fuel gauge. The fuel gauge would only ever fill to 3/4 and would have huge swings while driving (one minute have 1/4 tank, the next 3/4). To fix said problems, the local service department would have the car for 6 days (of which I was given a loaner car). Chrysler parts headquarters is located only on the west coast and we were informed,  ""Chrysler rules do not allow for overnight shipping of each part"" thus, adding to the delay. To add to my frustration, on numerous occasions when I picked the car up, noticeable collateral damage from the repairs would occur, including a broken rearview mirror, a torn passenger leather seat cover and door trim, and other various dirt and scuff marks of which I would yet again have to return to the service station to have addressed. I am coming up on 36,000 miles, the end of the manufacturer's warranty, just under two years of ownership (yet another flaw that Chrysler puts so little faith in their cars). I was greatly encouraged by the local service department to purchase the $1,500 extended warranty because in their words ""the radio, which controls almost everything electronic in the car, will be the next to go (cost of $1,400 to fix)."" In summary, although I was attracted to the interior design and look of the car, it is built with poor-quality parts that rattle and break down, and I made over thirty trips (I counted all service records) to the local service station for repairs and collateral damage fixes in just under two years. Prospective buyers of this car, I recommend do not purchasing this car and consider a certified pre-owned higher quality car with a long-term warranty.",neg
"The 2015 Cherokee only has recalls on days that end in y! Constant recalls and transmission problems with this POS! Half a dozen visits to the dealer for a transmission problem that they say they cannot reproduce. Then, the entire transmission needed to be replaced. Now the trans is slipping again and frequently ""slams"" into gear. Only 25000 miles on this heap! Two more trips to the dealer and ""cannot find a problem"". Problem is I bought a Chrysler product. Or, should I say a Fiat. I would tell them to ""Fix It Again, Tony"" if they would fix it. A friend had the same vehicle and dumped it off on CarMax. Will be trading this Jeep in before the warranty is up. And NOT on another Chrysler product!",neg
"This is actually the 3.2L V-6 model. Will never own another Jeep product again. 4 recalls and one ""campaign"" fix issue later; on the third radio now, as well as a transmission leak. This vehicle has been in the shop longer than all my previous vehicles combined in 24 years of driving experience. Transmission shift is still horrible after several computer updates, now at 43k miles it has started to leak on my garage floor. Headed back in for service once again",neg
"DO NOT BUY THIS CAR WHATEVER YOU DO! This car has been nothing but a heart and headache. It is absolutely terrible. Purchased car in the summer of '15 brand new (less than 35 miles) and just recently traded it in (with a little over 26k). If I could give this car negative stars I would. This is a death trap on wheels. While driving this car it literally completely shut off in the middle of the road. I was driving up a steep hill and around a bend. The engine completely shut off and the check engine light came on. I'm so very lucky to not have been hit. After getting car going again (which was a miracle itself) I made it back to my destination. I was 3.5 hours away from home. I attempted to drive it home to have it serviced. It made it less than 15 miles up the road before AGAIN having the engine completely shut off, in the middle of an intersection. $300 and tow to get it to a dealership anywhere close to home. It spent three days in the shop and one long commute to pick up my ""fixed"" car that wouldn't shift out of park. I've lost so much money on this having to trade it in. In just a year and a half it's worth almost HALF of what it was purchased for. I will never ever buy another jeep the rest of my god given days. This car is not worth a stick of gum. If you care about your safety and the safety of others on the road, I wouldn't even look at this car! IT IS TERRIBLE!!! It's the very definition of a lemon!!",neg
"Bought this car in Aug 2015 brand new car started out driving smoothly then at about 6000 miles or so I noticed the jeep began to drive different and then it got worse and worse, in October at 11000 miles being on the jeep I had to get the transmission replaced, the jeep began to drive like it once did go until January it began to jerk and accelerate on its own, just when I was going to make an appointment to get the car looked at the shifter locked on me causing to have to come to an abrupt stop luckily it was 5am when no one was out or I surely would've been in an accident I took the jeep in and they replaced the entire shifter, and did something to the brake vaccum pump  since then the car is still jerking and accelerating by itself especially when going down slight hills do not buy this car!",neg
Good looking suv with lots of great features just dangerous to drive when you pull into traffic. Shifts terrible. Even after 6 transmission updates. 2.4 liter engine is weak. Would not recommend this car to anyone.  Poor resale value for a jeep as well. I will say the 4 wheel drive works awesone in the snow. Safety and reliability however kills this car. Looking at being at the dealer every 6 months for a new transmission update.,neg
"So first I bought a 4 cyl Limited the thing was horrible no passing gear and would bog down when trying to pass and a shimmy in the front end. Traded for a V-6 thinking it would be better. Drove it home (had zero miles) and no sooner than I got home and decided to run to the store the fuel pump went out. Their is a shimmy in the front end of this one now too which I was told is part of the vehicle. The heat for your feat also comes out the defrost. I have to purchase 1 new tire because of the shimmy that is PART of the vehicle. My trade in value sucks so I am stuck with the worthless vehicle. The back seat is to small for my 12 and 13 year old for long trips. My advise stay far, far away!!!",neg
"The sales person was informed on the phone and in person several times that I did not want a 4 cyl vehicle.  I was under the impression for a year that I was driving a 6 cyl with little to no pick up and a bad transmission.  I only found out from the service department when I picked up the vehicle from one of numerous visits to the service department that they thought it drove ok for a 4 cylinder.  I was stunned.  I pulled out the window sticker to check and it doesn't indicate if the vehicle is a 4 or 6 cylinder vehicle at all.  My fault for trusting the sales person.  I am stuck with a 4 cylinder Jeep Cherokee with major transmission issues, at 22K miles the struts went up as well as the thermostat, the lift gate has come down on my head twice and does not sense that anything is in the way (It's a good thing a small child wasn't under it)  once it almost trapped me between it and the bumper, I just realized today why the heat doesn't work in the car when I reached behind me to grab something off the floor and noticed that while I have warm air blowing in front, ice cold air is blowing on the floor in the back.  I don't even know what else there is to say at this point.  My next call is to the General Manager and then to Chrysler.
Update 1/4/2018- and the saga continues with this vehicle.  Chrysler replaced the transmission and when I picked the car up from the dealership I drove the car to a friend's house.  When we got back in the car and I put the car in drive and stepped on the gas, the car went in reverse.  We both looked at the shifter to see what gear it was in and sure enough it was in drive.  In addition to this issue, on 4 occasions while accelerating from a stopped position, the engine will stop pulling the vehicle.  The RPM reading 4-5K rpms and the car is drifting to a stop.  Chrysler says they cannot recreate the problem.  The car will engage after coming to a full stop and start accelerating again.  The owner of the dealership recommended that I trade the car in and take the loss because there are problems with all 2014 and 2015 models and as of the date of our conversation, they weren't having the same issues with the 2016 models.  The service manager put in writing that this was not a safe system.  When I asked him if he would let his wife drive the car, he said absolutely not.  Now I am in litigation with Chrysler and Don Whites over the car.  The newest problem that just started 2 weeks ago-water started pouring in through the overhead light.",neg
This is the worst car I have ever owned. If you enjoy hanging out in service dept. this is your car.,neg
"I have a 2015 Jeep Cherokee with 15K miles on it. Since buying this car brand new I have had oil leaks, antifreeze leaks, thermostat replaced, weird noises coming from the engine that have left the service people clueless, excessive oil burning, and have had the vehicle completely shutoff while in motion on numerous occasions.  I have also found the transmission to be very jerky.  In November of 2016 after numerous trips to the shop, the dealer has decided to completely replace the entire engine!  What a nightmare this vehicle has been!",neg
"I bought the Jeep Cherokee Latitude in September 2015, the 1st recall was not a recall, a transmission line from the engine to transmission ( the car was sitting in my driveway ) my wife went out to go to the store, all the transmission oil was on the ground. I was told by the dealer that a ""O"" ring kit was blown (sitting ). since that time i have eight other recalls, now i have the 9th one, all this has taken place in one year, this just too much, i have had it, i am at my wits end. what can i do??????????????",neg
"Do not entertain the idea of trying a vehicle with a 9-speed. My 2015 Jeep Cherokee has been in the shop 7 times since I bought it a year and half ago. 9-speed transmission has no idea whether it's coming or going. RPMs spike (3500-4000) when going down or up hill and does not lower till you're on the straightaway. By that point, you have minimal power and when the transmission figures out what gear to be in, it clutters/jolts and puts you in a lower gear then you can continue accelerating.     When approaching a STOP SIGN or you YIELD, you slow down and then accelerate and the transmission hesitates then shutters to get you going. My dealerships states ""They are not able to duplicate the problem"" yet I drive it off their lot onto the roadway with these problems occurring. Service Manager rode with me so I can ""reproduce"" the issues and I was told ""It's normal"". I had a loaner from the dealership while Chrysler arranged for an engineer to work on fixing the transmission - the loaner was a Chrysler 200 Limited. This vehicle's transmission performed the same as my Jeep.",neg
"To start simply, this car had a rebuilt engine and transmission within the first 2,500 miles. I was warned in years past never to buy a new model's first year because the companies are usually working out kinks and i wish i listened. The engine started overheating really badly at about the 1,800-2,000 miles mark. I bring it in to the dealer and those inept mechanics told me it was a faulty spark plug or something and gave me the car back next day. Within three days i had to bring the car back and on this second trip they told me the engine got so hot it cracked the engine block! Three or four weeks later i get the rebuilt car back and within 10 days of that, the transmission was completely out of whack. I bring it back and about a week later they ""fixed"" it and returned it to me. I fought with chrysler corporate for months to get me out of this car that i didn't feel safe in but they only care about their bottom line and basically told me to sue them. I don't have the money for lawyers especially for a lease so i'm left counting the days till i can dump this trash. I know one coworker who had similar problems to me but because he financed his he went the whole 9 yards got a lawyer and the car was deemed a lemon and he got his money back. I CANNOT ADVISE STRONGLY ENOUGH AGAINST THIS CAR OR ANY CHRYSLER PRODUCE AFTER THE NIGHTMARE I WENT THROUGH. You've been warned!",neg
"From the first week I complained about the transmission as to how it jerks the whole car while changing gears. This is a 9 speed transmission and believe me the  Jerking is so bad  that it will give somebody a whiplash. It does not behave like a new car.  I took it  to the dealership and was told that it has a very intelligent computer and once it (the computer) figures out my driving habits it will smooth out. I now have 16,000 miles on it and it is getting worse.    I purchased a life time warranty for that reason,  I don't know what that is worth. One thing I have to admit it is great in the sand and snow. It is dangerous in the rain.  While on All Wheel Drive, do not accelerate around  curves as you will find yourself in the next lane over. This is not my first new car.  The last 50 years I purchased close to 15 new cars and this is the first LEMON I got.     REVIEW STILL APPLIES. THIS CAR IS A LEMON.(February,24,   2018",neg
"It's my fault for purchasing this high priced piece of hot trash. After owning a 1998 Cherokee that gave me ZERO issues and a half million miles (literally) I decided to try another twenty years later. I'm not stupid, I realize nothing will produce what the old fashioned straight six would in terms of dependability and torque, but it's a new era and it's all about mpg and style.  I test drove the Wrangler, Grand Cherokee and of course this rolling hemroid before burning my cashier's check away on the Trail Hawk. Ranting about how terrible everything from acceleration to zero torque, to the plastic interior and cramped quarters won't do it any justice. Please just realize that your better off buying a Honda fit and spray painting a 4*4 Badge on it. Their about the same except maybe the fit has more testosterone. I just cannot get over how Daimler murdered this brand name. The other two ""jeeps"" I test drove had mini van V6 engines in them and also needed a strong wind from the back and a downhill to get up and move. If your thinking of buying a ""jeep"" after 2003 model year then do what I should have done and burn your money outside the dealership and know it's better than driving out of the lot in your new Fiat with an awd option called jeep. I paid cash for mine and plan on donating it to heritage for the blind or cars for kids in order to regain at least some of my dignity.  Rest in peace Jeep.",neg
"When I bought this one, it was smooth and relative quiet inside for the first two months.  After two months, violent shifting of transmission and trembling of the engine became severe. I went to the Jeep repair shop several times to fix this problem. They always said that this transmission is the worst one ever and there was nothing they could do except S/W update from Jeep. But officially they said that there was no problem with this car. Even when my car stalled on the crossroad two times on the way to children's school, they repeated the same word. It was very risky situation to my family. I really recommend you that you not buy this model. You will regret it.",neg
"Update: Filed lawsuit against Chrysler, forced them into a complete buy back. They never suggested giving me another car...paid all fees, my expenses but I had to agree Chrysler was in fault. So they will put it back together and sell it to some unsuspecting person without them knowing the history. Since then the list of undependable cars, jeep with fiat motors and transmissions are all listed as bad choices.   That's my update. 
Bought 2015 jeep Cherokee 4x4 limited. Had less than 2 wks, won't start, when it does start, transmission out. Was at dealer for 3 wks, two new transmission modules later, got car back for 20 hrs. Has 500 miles on it.  Had towed back to dealer...same deal, transmission. Dealer had for another 4 weeks, then stripped down to wire harness. Dealer refusing to back me, towed vehicle home, have an atty, lawsuit filed today against Chrysler. Chrsler refused to respond to first atty complaint so now in civil case, oh and I'm making payments....since April 17th. A. Mazing!  How can I review my new car I can't drive?",neg
"The jeep cherokee limited is a great looking Suv , However the 9 speed Transmission Sucks !!! The salespeople will tell you its a smooth ride which is true however if you like to be jerked forward at times going 56 miles an hour i felt like i was going to get whiplash . Immediately called the dealership since my vechicle is only 8 months old and complained about the jerking once again which makes this number 2 for taking it back to the dealership . I was told by my service advisor ""It's like your cell phone we have to update the software  "". Seriously I have only updated my cell phone once in the last 2 years . I have been reading alot of consumers complaints regarding the transmmission and how the  dealerships keep telling consumers that everything is fine , if that was the case then explain to me why there are 190 complaints regarding the transmission on carcomplaints.com/ jeep , and also on Edmunds.com same thing consumers are reporting  Transmission problems . If my issue is not taken care of by the dealership I will be taking this to Chrysler. I did not pay 45,000.00 to have a vehicle transmission jerking .",neg
"I leased a brand new 2015 jeep trail hawk. More recalls than any other car I've owned. Constant problems transmission number 1.  Doesn't shift right, accelerates on own, turns off when foot not on brake ,  in 4 times . lift hatch fixed 4 times twice with new parts. Just got it back and they replaces lift hatch and said nothing is wrong with transmission. I called Jeep to complain that I've done research and there are currently civil action law suits for the same. My husband received a call from dealer and it needs new transmission. REALLY YIU JUST SAID NOTHING IS WRONG WITH IT. I DONT WANT TO DRIVE IT. I WANT THEM TO TAKE BACK. We pay a lot of money for this top of line lemon.",neg
"I bought my 2015 jeep Cherokee latitude in September 2015, since day one i have had nothing but problems with it. first day complete computer reinstall and the headliner fell, two days later same thing, since then its had four axles and more software problems than i can count. dealership cannot find the problems and trying to work with the dealership and Chrysler corporate is like being between two babies that constantly fight each other. i warn anyone who is going to buy this car Don't its not worth it. I regret everyday with it and may be filing a lemon law claim or trading it in.",neg
"I bought this car May 11th 2015. I went to visit my family 4 hrs away for Memorial day 2 1/2 weeks later and the transmission light came on half way into the trip- less than 1500 miles on the car! I had to park my brand new car for a holiday weekend until a dealership opened up on Tues. They reset the light- said it was nothing. It came back on during  my ride home. I drove directly to the dealer. They had the car from May 27th-June 9th and replaced the transmission. I hadn't even made a payment yet. June 12th the light is back on!!! 2174 miles on the car. I only had it back 3 days..back to the dealer I go. Now they have the car from June 12-July 2nd and they tell me they have replaced the valve body. July 7th on my way to work and the light goes back on as well as the parking brake light and the 4x4 light. I smell something burning. The dealer has to come and tow the car away. Now I am calling Chrysler asking for a repurchase- I don’t want this car! They don’t call me back for three weeks. 
July 22nd I get the car back after a 2nd replaced transmission. July 28th back to the dealer again! This time a 3rd transmission is placed in the car and I get it back Sept 4th. The car at this point has 2664 miles on it. 
I filed a lemon law suit with FCA Chrysler on July 17th 2015. I am still fighting this claim. I have been driving the car since Sept but the transmission is not right. It screams down hills and does not shift. It screams up hills and shifts so hard the whole car jerks. The dealer tells me there is nothing wrong with this transmission. It does not shift well- this is not normal. Chrysler is not responding to the lawyers on this claim and they are trying to make me settle with a deduction for the miles I have put on the car. I cannot believe that Chrysler is handling this so poorly. I will never but another Chrysler/Jeep product again nor will I recommend them. The car stinks- the company stinks!
11/25/16 update*** it took me until last week to have he lemon law competed. The transmission still slips and still screens going up or down a hill. I am so happy to be out of this car. The whole process was a nightmare and it cost me way too much money to fight FCA. I still stand behind my original review- horrible company and an ok car with a bum transmission.",neg
"I have had my car for just over 1 year. As I  write this and make a car payment my Latitude is with the dealer having its engine replaced. It has been there since last Wednesday and they are not sure if I will have it back by next week. The dealer's service department has been great. Chrysler's response has been disappointing. I am concerned about this vehicle and have wavering confidence about a safe resolution to my issue. The only way I knew there was an issue was when the car simply stopped working while I was driving. Thankfully, I was not on a major roadway and was able to safely restart and get to the dealership. While a recall may not be in order, I would suggest that Chrysler, at the very least, have each of these vehicles inspected for the defect as I know I am not the only one experiencing this issue. It took only a short Google search to find many who have had the same experience. It is really a shame, as I do like the vehicle.",neg
"Have my 2015 Chrokee for a year and a half. Always in the shop. Dashboard is like a Christmas tree. Dealers don't know how to fix it. Chrysler will not exchange car. Want me to bring it back a fourth time. Jeep customer care blames dealer, dealer blames customer care which won't authorize more costly repair. This is my forth Chrysler vehicle and my last.

"This SUV is not worth spending money on! The first week I bought this Jeep the engine light came on 3 different times. Kept getting the runaround by the dealership. Now that I have had this Jeep for a year, I have realized buying it was the worst decision I ever made when buying a car. I paid a little over $32,000 and a year later it is only valued at $15,000-17,000. I cannot even trade for anything that I want because of the difference of value and what is owed.  The 4WD doesn't work right at all. I have had to have the gas cap fixed, a senor in the front bumper, the backup camera and other numerous things. This Jeep is not worth it. Buyer beware!",neg
"Please beware, they have A LOT of transmission problems. I've noticed issues on my first week driving it. The process of returning the car is NOT easy.",neg
"My 2015 Jeep has the V6 with that stupid stop/start feature, I hate this. If you forget to turn it off each time you start the jeep at the first stop sign it shuts off, always catches me off guard. Next is the so called 4WD, wrong it's front wheel all the time and it's supposed to kick in the rear when needed. Even in the snow or mud mode front wheels spin like crazy. I bought my first jeep in 1977 and I've had 6 different models and my wife has had 7 Grand Cheerokes, I'll never have another Cheeroke like this one. Can't wait till my wife wants a new Grand Cheeroke so I can have her old one (2014) and get rid of my 2015 Cheeroke.
Update couldn't wait any longer-traded it in on a Dodge Ram.",neg
I have had trouble with customer service at both dealerships I've been to and through the Jeep company itself. Several issues with car and I am not impressed with its safety on ice. I'm on the verge of trading it for another brand and I've only had it 1.5 yrs (bought brand new). Never again will I own a jeep based purely on the extremely poor customer service and maintenance service.,neg
"Transmission has a delayed response to accelerating when turning left against oncoming traffic.  Transmission is very jerky...not accelerating when it should, at some times, not going into reverse, causing several near accidents.  My 16 year old daughter learned how to drive with this faulty transmission..has caused her trouble driving other cars.  After dealership repair for 3rd time, I'm pursuing protection under the lemon law.  Dealership Service manager said there are no fixes other than software flashes that don't work and that even a new transmission replacement would be the same design/faults.  It amazes me that Jeep is still selling these cars with faulty transmissions.",neg
My 2015  jeep v6 Cherokee Limited is now back again for transmission work it now sounds like a helicopter noise when doing 0 to 60 and more when going back from 60 to 0. I don't see how they can deal wi y h this 9 speed it should never have been used. My other car has a 6 speed and no problems.  This jeep is only 15 months old  and more trouble then the other 2 jeeps I have owned. Never again with jeep,neg
"I regret buying this jeep.  They are not at all made the way they used to be made.  Within the first 2 months of having it, the seat in the back bust at the zipper and cannot be repaired - has to be replaced.  One week after purchasing I had to take it back in because the tint was bubbling.  Now I'm at 15,000 miles and when you turn the car on, the RPMs go up and down and up and down and up and down.... then after about a minute they get back to normal.  The transmission does not shift properly and jerks you around.  I got the doors wet with rain and now all 4 of the door's interior are bubbling and destroyed.  This is the most expensive piece of crap I've ever bought.  I am so disappointed in Jeep.  Will never buy a new jeep again.",neg
"The car was bought new 2015.  Its been recalled for 3 different things.  It accelerated on its own to the point where I have almost hit people. I was not aware the car would just take off on its on.  That was somewhat taken care of during the recall.  
It downshifts on its own(sounds like its going to blow up) I was told this is normal but I don't think so.  It hesitates when you go from a stop to anywhere! I've almost been hit too many times to count. Its a death trap and I have no choice but to drive this car with my children until my lease is up.
This Jeep still sucks (2017) and Im getting rid of it in December this year. It still hesitates from a stop to going forward..almost like its out of gas but nothing is ever wrong with it or so says the jeep dealership.",neg
"Purchased a 2015 3.2L V6 Jeep Cherokee with the Auto stop feature on 04 Nov 2015 with 95 original miles on it. Within the first 150 miles of ownership the vehicle was taken back for a terrible back up camera and the odd shifting patterns with forward lunging in first to second gear. The dealership I purchased the Jeep from kept a full day to tell me theirs was nothing wrong with the camera and didn't even talk about the shifting patterns. So I assumed they tested and repaired. Nope was wrong to think that at all. Took jeep back again  at around 265 mile to again bring up the issue with the horrible hesitation and shifting problems. Service rep explained the vehicle needed to learn my driving habits and to break-in. So read the Jeeps manual and it stated break-in period of 350 miles. So I drove the vehicle with apprehension due to nearly being hit and almost hitting another vehicle. Jeep was taken back to service department with 587 miles where they performed a Trans quick learn procedure which only made the shifting and lunging worse. Was told to drive so the vehicle could learn my driving habits also. So I drove it to break-in as they stated but the issues never improved but just became worse. Vehicle was taken back at 858 miles and I explained it was progressing to get worse instead of better. They tested it and stated they could not duplicate the issues. Then was told that is how this model operates and it still is no broken in yet it required more miles  for break-in for that transmission and engine control modules to learn. Of course I knew this was nonsense. I contacted FCA customer care over the these issues and a case number was given at that point and was advised to take to a different dealership for a second opinion, huh was my response to that suggestion. A trip to Mississippi popped into the picture so had to wait till  I returned to follow their suggestion. I decided to drive the jeep to Mississippi and add these so call break-in miles to see if a change would happen. It became worse at times not wanting to accelerate through intersections to not wanting to accelerate while merging into traffic on I20 it was a scary drive. FCA was in contact with me and I told them what it did in Mississippi and Louisiana. The Jeep now has a long delay when going into reverse which nearly caused a on coming vehicle to strike my vehicle when I pulled out a little on a side road thinking it was part of a Canes restaurant parking lot in Ruston Louisiana. On the same trip returning from Mississippi on I-20 in DFW it became stop and go traffic heading west. Near Arlington I came to a complete stop on a slight incline with bumper to bumper traffic when the auto stop turned on like programed to do. Removed my foot off of the brake while hill assist was to remain engaged the engine had a slight starting delay more than normal and my jeep rolled backwards nearly hitting the vehicle behind me. I was under the assumption the Jeep would remain in place till engine started and transmission fluid pressure was back for the forward gear. Of course I became more frustrated with the dang thing now so took back to the service department  at 2256 miles for these added issues that could not be ignored. Service drove 6 miles and said can not duplicate after sitting several hours. Believe one of the sales people took it out for the drive instead of the technician. I know they are getting frustrated with me taking it back to them to repair but over $29,000 was paid for an unreliable vehicle. I finally wrote the CEO of FCA and explained the problems I was having with the vehicle and that I am only getting ""can not duplicate at this time"" response which I believe is now the policy with FCA. I received a call from a woman higher up the chain of command asking to take to a different dealership for second opinions which to me sounds like being pawned off and starting this run around all over again. I stated to her they were quick to put me into the vehicle so they should take responsibility for this since they know its history. She told me to set up an appointment at dealership I purchased it from so they could send a field service engineer so he could trouble shoot and see if a transmission replacement is required. Well two PCM re-flashes and of course no change it still runs the same. They kept from a Tues till Fri and it sat waiting on the field service engineer to advice the service department what the next step would be. I went and picked up my vehicle because no loaner was given while they determine what the heck was going on. I am still waiting on something to be done as of 01Mar 2016 by FCA. I looked into a class action lawsuit that has been filed against FCA dealing with this same problem and put my self and details on the list for these problems also writing a complaint the NHTSA. (Edit)1 Sept 2016 traded it for a 2016 Cherokee. Lost over 10g's in trade damn. 2016 9 speed trans is just as bad. Front suspension popping now.",neg
"I have always had a love for Jeeps. My first Jeep, Pigeon was a 1998 Cherokee Inline 6. I loved that car to pieces, she did me good the 5 years I had her, however, I'm driving a further distance to work and school so I had to give her up sadly. Ended up buying a KIA Soul, traded that in after a year because I was scared for my life in that car. Here I thought I was getting a dream car because I always dreamed about owning a new Jeep... Then this car entered my life and I regret driving this off the lot. I don't have as many problems as other reviews, but it's a BRAND NEW CAR and shouldn't have to worry about ""what if my warranty runs out and then all this happens"". This Transmission is really sketch. I hate the way it jolts at random. The acceleration in this car is just as bad as the Kia Soul that I traded it in for. The AC and heater are terrible. I can never be at a comfortable temp. You're either freezing or burning up. The gas is terrible on this car. I feel like my 1998 did way better in gas. The Uconnect is a joke. It works when it wants to work. I literally have to turn off my car at times for it to sync.  When it rains the tires spin and I'm not trying to jet off since it won't even do that if I tried. I'm very disappointed in Jeep. I was always proud to be a Jeep owner and now I'm kind of embarrassed. After seeing the crash videos on this car I hope I NEVER hit a pole or a wall because it seems this car like to burst up in flames. If I could get rid of this car I would. I want to take this car in and have everything  checked but from the looks of it, Jeep doesn't really care.  My love for Jeep has died. Whenever I get the chance I will get rid of this car. Unfortunately I have to wait many years before that happens. I better start saving now since my year is almost up in May. Do yourself a favor, don't get this car. I should have gone Import. I hate to say it but it's true.",neg
"I purchased one brand new. Left me stranded @ 1,123 miles. A wire was not soldered correctly to the computer and came off. Transmission shifting funny, and lots of engine noise.

STAY FAR AWAY from any of the new Chrysler/Fiat models. In regards to this model, the Cherokee, I am sure you have read many reviews on the transmission problems, and the difficulty in dealing with the dealership and service people. This vehicle is a complete disaster. We have to deal with them on a daily basis, everything from the transmission to electrical problems. One of the worst lately is the thermostat fails around 30K. The problem is so bad we have mothballed our 2015 models because the replacement thermostat ""unit"", which is a non-removable thermostat housed in a multi-port junction, is unavailable for MONTHS because they are out of them.... it is a nationwide shortage. These things are dropping like flies. If yours goes out after warranty, prepare to pay at least 2 hours labor (HARD to get to) and $200 for the part. This is the worst vehicle I have ever dealt with, so if you heed the advice of someone who has worked on hundreds, STAY AWAY.",neg
"In April 2015 we purchased a 2015 Jeep Cherokee, brand new! They literally unwrapped it in front of us. We were so excited for a little luxury upgrade! This car was just gorgeous inside and out! This is our 3rd Jeep, in the last 5 years. Soon after the purchase we began having issues. When we would call into the dealership to bring up our concerns regarding the violent shifting of the transmission we were told it was “normal” on EVERY occasion. So far, in 9 months it has been in for 3 recalls and 2 “software updates”. By September ’15 the transmission issues had gotten so bad we finally got them to agree to “test drive” our vehicle, our numerous attempts prior to this were always met with “well this is normal for this vehicle” and then we were told that the service department was so backed up with transmission repairs that we would have to drop off our vehicle for possibly up to two weeks, before they could look at it and we would NOT be provided a rental since the “check engine light was not on” . After basically demanding that they check this problem out because the car was just months old and has only 6k miles on it they agreed to “check” it on September 18th, they still refused to give us a rental, and we agreed to leave it for the weekend so they could address the problem. They called to notify us that they had “test drove” the car and nothing was wrong with it, my husband requested that he be able to sit in a test drive with the service man the following morning and asked him not to start or drive the car until he got there, when he showed up to do this test drive the service department told him they test drove the car again (even though they were asked not to) and that again, they found “nothing wrong with it” At this point my husband was furious. Not only did they not address the problem, but they also didn’t care to follow the requests of the cars owner. Now it is January 2016, the car is still shifting hard, or not shifting at all, as well as an issue with  a recall that was done a few months ago for the car where when you would turn the air/heat on the car would sputter and almost stall, was happening again, even after the supposed “software update”  So we once again contact the dealer to address an issue, they again tell us we need to just drop off our vehicle for an unspecified amount of time and they will not provide us with a rental, mind you this is our daily driver. So we then contact Chrysler directly, where they inform us we are eligible for a rental, and they will make sure that we get one, as well as be able to leave our car at the dealership for 5 days and then we will go from there. January 22, 2016 we take drop our vehicle off at the dealership so they can try to tell us what is going on with the transmission, again we are told that this is “normal” they tell us that it is a “Fiat Transmission, and that it shifts gears differently”  miraculously this time the service department drives the car and says they do feel the issues we are bringing up, and that is was a “software update” to fix the problem. Well… I have already had a software update, that FAILED! Following I will list the issues; First the vehicle shifts roughly into every gear, causing my vehicle to jolt forward, second, when at a complete stop and then beginning to accelerate the  vehicle has a delay, the engine revs and it finally jerks forward to go. Most the time the vehicle reaches 5-6k RPMs before it ever shifts gears. Third, when you start the car and turn on the air/heat the car drops below 1k RPMs, shakes and almost stalls. NONE of this is “normal” as the dealership states, this is especially NOT “normal” for a brand new car with significantly low mileage. The transmission should have ZERO problems. When I received my vehicle back from the dealership this last time, I got onto the freeway to drive home and it wasn’t until the vehicle reached 6k RPMs that it finally shifted into a gear. This is 100% unsafe, like I stated earlier in my letter, this is our daily driver, it is the vehicle that I buckle my two young children into EVERY SINGLE DAY, I count on this vehicle to get me to and from my destination in the safest manner available. Because of the jerking from the shifting of the transmission it can easily result in an accident. There have been times where I have almost hit the person in front of me because of the jolt forward coming out of a complete stop, as well as almost being hit from behind because my vehicle does not accelerate properly. This is not something I want to wait around for, this is something I am not willing to deal with until another “software update” is available, or until the manufacturer finally recalls this vehicle (which will happen) because it is a clear safety issue, causing my family to potentially be injured or worse. I do not feel safe in this vehicle, nor do I feel comfortable putting my children in it. Two visits to the dealership to repair this problem is far too many for a car",neg
"I purchased my 2015 cherokee in April and by may the wobble was so bad and the shifting so dramatic that I went into a ditch. Over the next 2 months new transmission and new axel on front driver and passenger sides. 3 software updates for the transmission and still  shifting horrible. Looked up lemon law rules for my state and followed them. No attorney and 6 months later they bought it back. They have no choice but to if they haven't fixed it after 4 tries. Send certified letter to corporate giving them one more try to fix it and if they don't BUY BACK TIME.  Call your state's consumer protection department and they will help get you on track. They paid retail price of the vehicle plus registration, tax,doc fee,warranty fees, gap that didn't get refunded to me as well as any accessories I put on the jeep. I also got ALL the interest in paid above everything else which if you figure half your payments go toward interest at the start of the loan so was nice.   Stand up for yourself and don't except a lemon.  For the record I bought a nissan murano and damn impressed.  Of course I still have my wrangler. ..JEEP gets in the blood.",neg
"2015 Jeep Cherokee Latitude 4wd V6

First of all I would like to say that I drove a 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited for the better part of 10 years and (except for the gas mileage) I was extremely pleased with the vehicle.  In  fact my granddaughter is still driving that Jeep today.  Because I was so pleased with that vehicle, I purchased a 2015 Jeep Cherokee Latitude and I absolutely love the way my vehicle looks, handles and drives as well as the gas mileage and comfort.  For the most part it serves my needs very well.  The only problem I have with my Jeep is outlined below:

In the beginning I had no problems with the way the vehicle performed, but after about 3000 miles I began experiencing problems with the 9 speed electronic transmission.  After slowing down to a near stop and then accelerating, the transmission will hesitate before engaging into the proper gear.  Because of this I almost had two accidents,  one of which caused me to come very close to running through the wall in my garage.  Also, if I start moving forward and give the vehicle maximum acceleration, when I release the accelerator pedal, there is a substantial delay before the vehicle stops accelerating. 

Further, I have tried numerous times to use the manual shift feature to downshift to slow the vehicle down when driving down steep hills.  There is a significant delay (several seconds) after I attempt to down shift before the transmission actually responds and by then the speed of the vehicle has increased such that the engine speed increases to over 5000 RPM when the shift occurs.  For my use, the manual change feature on the Jeep is absolutely useless.

Relative to the 9th gear, I have checked the transmission gear readout numerous times by moving the shift lever left, and I have never seen the transmission indicate that it was in 9th gear.  In fact it will only shift to 8th gear when I am going down hill.
Occasionally, after coming to a stop and then starting up, the transmission will lock up in 1st gear and I have to accelerate up to about 25 miles per hour before it shifts and then it shifts quickly through several gears.  I can also force it to change by getting the engine speed up to about 2500 RPM and then letting off the accelerator thereby allowing the gears to change.

I have explained and demonstrated all of this to the service manager at the dealership where I bought the vehicle and they have been most accommodating it trying to alleviate the problems I have had with the transmission.  They have even replaced the transmission, to no avail.  I still have the same problems and I am told by the dealership that this is all normal and within the designed operating parameters of the transmission. 

I have subsequently contacted Chrysler Customer Care and they opened a case number in my name (refer to above case number) wherein I was instructed to take the vehicle back to the dealership again.  Upon taking the vehicle back, I was told once more that the transmission is performing within design operating parameters and their diagnostic test do not indicate any problems.  Chrysler Customer Care contacted the Area Manager and he said that since the vehicle was operating as designed, there is nothing further that they would do for me.  They suggested that I change the way I drive to accommodate the way the vehicle is performing.  They have subsequently closed the case.

This is a totally unacceptable conclusion.  I have driven other new Chrysler products with automatic transmissions and they do not in any way perform the same as my Jeep.    I do not know what to suggest as a solution to my dilemma, but  I am extremely uncomfortable with driving my jeep even though circumstances force me to do so.  I am fairly certain that there are other Cherokee owners that are having the same issues with their vehicle and I would be very surprised if there weren't some related accidents.

Have subsequently traded for a new Grand Cherokee with 8 speed.

"Transmission is horrible - software updates can't correct the problem and it's ongoing. The Jeep learns driver's driving habits - I drive country, freeway and city to and from the work - Jeep doesn't know how to function. 
It's been in the shop 5 times the past 3 months and service says ""it's normal"" or ""can't duplicate the problem"". Transmission seems to maintain a high gear when slowing. When accelerating,  there is hesitation and the Jeep lunges. Crash waiting to happen.
Interior of Jeep is nicely set up. Only complaint would be to move the BRIGHT LIGHT indicator from behind the RPM'S  (which hides the indicator while maintaining 1500-1750 RPMs.",neg
"Brought my 2014 Jeep Cherokee Latitude last year.  Have had several recalls on it, but no real issues.  Today, of all days, Christmas Eve, went to the mall to finish Christmas shopping as I entered the mall going up a hill I hear the engine reving, struggling look down and see  SERVICE TRANSMISSION across the control panel.  Went to the Jeep Dealership and all I am told is, ""There is nothing we can do until Monday morning.""  So here I am stranded for Christmas.  TERRIFIC!",neg
"Vibrates Squeaks Doors Dash And never been on a dirt road This is my 2nd. 2015 Cherokee the first one broke down 20 miles from the dealer keep it 33 days couldn't fix it told them to give me a new one or I would get a lawyer they did should have made them give my money back!!!!!
The Uconnect went out after a week on the new one took 63 DAYS to get a new one.
Both of them had more squeaks than a mouse in pain.",neg
"Everyone is telling the truth about the transmission.  It feels like someone is slamming into the back of us. Its so scary. The car putts like a hoopty and is so loud it's embarrassing to be in a new car. I was replacing a luxury edition Mercury Mountaineer so imagine my frustratiin. The battery is missing a bolt, the rear seat belt is broken and we haven't even had it a year. The backup cam froze on me and I almost ran into a wall in my garage. When I noticed how loud the car is, I took it back to the dealership immediately, only to be told everything is fine. Sometimes it shakes so bad you can't see clearly in the mirror. There always feels like something is scraping when we're driving! I was told it could be the software making it jump. There have already been 2 recalls! The air and heat do not barely blow on your feet. This car scares me so much; I don't feel safe in it.  I hate this car and want to drive it over a cliff! The sad part is i talked my husband into buying although he wanted something else. Its too much. I cant. . . .",neg
"Transmission problems make this a vehicle to avoid.  My 2015 Cherokee (6 cyl, 9 speed transmission)  looked great inside and out, and handled nicely. However, the powertrain was a disaster.  The engine, the transmission, and the Auto Stop/Start system seemed to have declared war on each other, and the result was a vehicle that made any journey an adventure, in a bad way.  It would shift into fourth gear by about 30 mph, then never be able to find an appropriate gear.  The transmission's nine speeds should be named clunking, hesitating, surging, hunting, grinding, freewheeling and ""3 overdrive gears that are never used"".  Its transmission was replaced at 900 miles, and started showing the same symptoms at 3000 miles. The vehicle had three recalls and 9 overnight stays in the dealers' repair bays in six months.  It was one scary ride.  This review is written in the past tense since I sold it to  CarMax  last month at 3200 miles and bought a 2016 Mazda CX-5 (which I love so far).",neg

"I bought this vehicle for my daughter (age16.) We don't let her drive it anymore. It has gone dead in the middle of the highway with myself and her dad in the car. We have only had the car 4 months currently has 5000 miles on it. We are now experiencing problems with the transmission. It is my daily driver at the moment. I have been stranded on the side of the road twice. I carried it to the dealership. That claimed they did an update this past Wednesday. On Friday morning, the car would not go up my driveway.",neg

"We purchased a 2015 Jeep Cherokee 3.2L V6 with the 9sp transmission in May of this year.  At 10,700 miles it has started exhibiting transmission issues.  The Check Engine light and the Service Stop/Start System Telltale light came on.  The vehicle went into ""limp mode"" and would only do 35 miles per hour. I was on a major highway and had to pull off the road.  The rpm's were elevated.  I managed to nurse it home (only 3 miles) and called the dealership. (which is 46 miles from my home) I was told that it was ""OK"" to drive the vehicle to them.  I declined.  It never would have made it.  The dealership refused to have it towed to them and suggested that I take it to another dealership in town.  I once again declined and used my own AAA service to get it towed to them.  They had the car for 2 1/2 days (they did provide me with a rental) and told me that it had a software update that needed to be performed per a service notice and test drove it for 10 miles to see if the lights would come back on.  (I was skeptical because I had already started reading all of the BAD reviews)  I have driven it 83 miles and both lights are back on.  I purchased this vehicle because I was replacing a Town and Country Mini Van that we had for over 8 years because it was becoming unreliable......I have a ""new"" car that is already proving to be a LEMON. 
I will update this as my journey continues.
**** update ****
    This Jeep went into the shop again.     This time I was told it had a defective transmission, they were going to replace it under warranty.   after two weeks I had to call for an update, it seems they installed a new transmission (#2) from FCA but it was the same series of transmission and they were about to call me but were alerted to the ooops.    Another transmission (#3) was sent and it was installed.    In appx 110 miles, same issue happened.    They towed it back, we got the same rental (under the warranty, we HAD to drive a jeep product while ours was in for work).   In a nutshell, they installed transmissions #4 & #5 in the course of less than 16 weeks.   The jeep was in the shop a total over 40 days for the transmission.    
    We initiated ""lemon law"" proceedings  and in a few short weeks, FCA was required to buy the jeep back from us (minus a mileage usage allowance).     So while I consider ourselves lucky in that respect, we have decided, we can no longer afford to buy Chrysler.    The quality we had come to expect over the years (three generations) is just not there anymore.      even if the transmission had been a good component, the jeep was far less than one would expect from this legendary brand.
3rd and final update.    Jeep is now FCA problem.    they bought it back from us (thank you NC lemon law).    We have no plans on buying another Chrysler product.    Since this ""review"", we have purchased a Nissan truck to replace the Cherokee.    So far there have been zero issues.
edmunds is asking me to ""update"" this review.... the only thing i can say is that we are still very adamant about not purchasing another chrysler or fiat product.",neg

I bought a 2015 jeep sport 4 cylinder and have transmission issues already havent even got the tags for it or made one payment on it . When you use reverse and put it in driver it has a hesitation then jumps into gear. Also when put in park from drive or reverse in sounds like the front end is going to fall out. Took it to the dealership and was told it has a memory transmission and it takes time to get used to you i said ok but the front end sounding like it was about to fall out i dont belive that is memory. They have had it for for days and finally tell me they have to wait for Chrysler to approve a part this was after doing updates on a brand new car what the heck.So i call the next day and they tell me that it needs a new transmission and they dont know how long it will take but they have ordered it. After all the reviews i have read i am scared to death of this jeep and for my family i wish i would have done my homework first and to pour salt in my wound i got my tags today for it for heaven sake and its at the shop .Feeling very scared and very mad i guess it will take a lot of deaths before jeep does something about this issue and thats sad i hope i am not a statistic,neg
"I purchased this vehicle new from a dealer in Sept of 2014. I loved it at first (minus the stop/start feature) which I learned could be shut off by ""simply"" hitting a button EACH TIME YOU GET IN THE VEHICLE. They say it's a feature that is supposed to help with fuel usage, but I'm not sure how that could be good on a vehicle considering every time you come to a stop the car shuts down. First issue was when I would turn the vehicle to the right it would make a vibrating feeling on my steering wheel. I notified the service dept where I purchased the vehicle. I had the service manager ride along with me to show him (because the service tech couldn't get it to do it while he drove it). The service manager said it was normal and that it will take a couple of months for my car to get used to the way I drive. I've never heard of such a thing. I also asked him why he shuts down and shifts funny. He said that was also normal. So for the next year I drove the vehicle and assumed all of the hard shifting and kicking was normal since the SERVICE MANAGER said it was. During that time the car stalled on me in an intersection not once, not twice, but 3 times. It stalled on my dad who test drove it, as well as my husband. I had already notified the dealership multiple times. But again, it was ""normal"". Finally @ 19,xxx miles last week I was traveling the turnpike going approx. 65 mph the vehicle shut completely off and my dash started flashing. I was terrified and thankful nobody was behind me other wise I would have been re ended at a high rate of speed. I was able to coast over to the shoulder and had the vehicle towed to the service dept. It was giving me a ""service transmission"" message. I tried to move forward, but the car just rolled while giving it gas. I got a call that my car was fixed and ready for pick up 3 days later. I was told they ""cleared the codes and could not get it to duplicate"" which was not a good enough answer for me. I fought with the dealership telling them I didn't want to get back in that car because I was scared it would happen again. The service manager told me it had been fixed and would be okay. She said if it happens again, they may need to replace my transmission. She told me it was a known problem with that vehicle and that they wouldn't know unless it happens again. Still not satisfied with this answer I regretfully got in my jeep and drove home. I live in the country and take roads where I do not have cell service, so I was terrified of it happening again. I made it home, thankfully. I got in my car to go to my mom's surgery the next morning. I almost made it there. I got into the hospital parking lot and while driving up a hill, my car did it again. This time it rolled backwards. Thankfully nobody was behind me! I thank God that both times this happened I have been in a safe area. Needless to say, I have since then talked the dealership into buying the car back (I took a hit on it) and purchased a 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee. Hopefully it doesn't have the same issue.",neg
"every since I bought the Jeep Cherokee sport had nothing but head ack. The car is only 5 months old the transmission was replaced due to shuttering and did not go away then they said axel, they replaced Axel and they loaded and reloaded  the computer , the car acts like is on steroid. I loved Jeep but the disappointment is greater  now . I do believe Chrysler knows about the problem but they do not want to admit. I have had this car for 5 months it has been in service shop every other week. Dealership is not cooperating and I am left with a lemon.",neg
"Hello. I wanted to let you know that I am very disappointed in the Jeep Cherokee that I purchased less than one year ago. 

You see, the ""Jeep"" name has always had a special place in my heart, and this purchase was not only my first brand new car 

purchase, but also my first Jeep vehicle purchase. It was a very special experience and time for me, but I want to tell you 

that the 2015 Jeep Cherokee is the biggest disappointment ever, and here are the reasons why:

1. It was terrible in the snow last year. I purchased this the day after Thanksgiving (2014), and the car handled very 

poorly in the snow months of December - February. There was a time when I could not even drive the car up a hill that had 

not been plowed. Compared to my 2003 Honda Element, which was the car that this Jeep replaced, the snow handling is an epic 

fail.

2. The Heated Seats Options will either burn your butt off or you vaguely feel the heated seats.

3. The temperature controls are terrible. Again, you're either roasting in the car or you're freezing cold, but there is no happy medium.

4. The bluetooth option to my iPhone 6 Plus is intermitten. Sometimes it works instantly, sometimes, it will not sync up whatsoever, and is extremely tempermental.

5. Right after purchasing the car, less than 3,000 miles, there must have been something wrong with the transmission because each time I would shift the transmission to back up out of a parking space then switch to drive, it would ""jolt"" the car as if it you were being shaken. We brought the car back to have the transmission reprogrammed, and that issue isn't as big anymore.

6. The transmission when accelerating is very poor. Again, my Honda Element as a 4-cylinder engine, so I thought this Jeep's 4-cylinder engine would be okay/perform the same, but it doesn't. When I accelerate, there is a 20 second delay before the car will actually accelerate.

7. After it has rained outside and there is water on the car, don't even attempt to open your windows because water WILL come into your car. My Honda Element did not have the window protectors, but when the car was wet and I would make turns in the vehicle, water would not come into my car.  This Jeep has water running in.

All in all, I am very disappointed and unhappy with this car. If I could afford another car, I would get another one, and I no longer have such a ""love"" for the Jeep brand anymore after this experience.",neg
"I have only had vehicle since March - no winter driving yet (live in Minnesota). The computer/transmission is current on recall updates except R27 (liftgate fire possibility).  So there are no transmission updates pending.  But, the vehicle has minimal deceleration with no trottle, and downhill on ice seems like it will be a real safety issue.  Going down hill with no trottle, tach gains RPM, and vehicle continues to accelerate dangerously if brake is not applied.  Putting transmission into ""manual"" control (say 3rd gear as top gear) does not help at all.  After reading the various reviews about transmission issues, it seems pretty worthless to talk to service people or customer reps.  I think maybe lawyers may be needed to shake these people up before we start seeing fatalities because of this poorly thought-out design.  Fiat-Chrysler should be buying them back.

Update May 10.  We made it through an easy winter... transmission still same -- unable to get downhill control without use of brakes.  Ready to check resale value soon.",neg
"Transmission is a FAIL! 2 transmissions with one oil change!  Very unsafe! Not to mention AC failure, brakes, muffler, driveshaft falling out on road while driving, battery failed i can keep going and going! Jeep declined to fix the horrible shifting so now im a LEMON!",neg
"Transmission is horrible with the 6 cylinder engine. Very unpredictable and bad shifts (late, early and rough). The problem is very apparent going from 1 to 3 gear with violent jerks. It is unacceptable that Jeep can get away with such a horrible transmission in this day and age. Its a slap to face for the consumer when the engineers stated to the press that people are experiencing problem because of ""how Americans drive"" indicating that they have no intent to provide any type of meaningful fix. There is no way to correctly accelerate without horrible shifts or getting stuck on a gear. Around 4000 miles, my transmission when into a safety mode, locking it to one gear. Overall, it was very stressful to drive with transmission, not knowing when it will shift and if you will have enough power to accelerate. The violent shifts will definitely cause reliability with the engine. Replacing the transmission doesn't resolve the issue since they are all the same. Adding salt to the wound, the resale (KBB value) was terrible when I decided to trade it in at 11k miles. I will never purchase another Jeep/chrysler/fiat in my life time.",neg
"If I could negatively rate my Cherokee I would.
I don't even know where to start with the issues...
Purchased 3/29/2015- in the shop for the 1st time June 2015 with transmission issues (they claimed it just needed some updates)
In the shop for 2nd time 10/1/2015- still with transmission issues. They replaced the valve body and harness.
Brought car back home 10/13/2015
Had to bring it back to the shop the very next day, almost got in an accident with the transmission issues, my car stalled in the middle of an intersection.
It bucks and has delayed acceleration/gear switching. It kicks itself out of drive while I am driving on the highway. It bucks and stalls in traffic.
Had to bring my car back to the shop 10/14/2015 (as of today 10/23/2015 it is still in the shop with no end in sight) and escalated my case with Chrysler. 
Chrysler and the dealership have been an absolute nightmare to deal with.
All I want is a safe car and to have my car bought back from me.
Please stay away!

Update:
Chrysler did not do anything to honor the car being a lemon. I ended up having to take a $5,000 loss, but am in a Nissan Rouge now and I absolutely love it!",neg
"I decided to make this post in regards to my recent issues with Jeep. But first I would like to start by saying that I love Jeep. I have had quite a few,  and I love the wrangler and always have. Fast forward to my current situation. I purchased my Jeep Cherokee in March. 2 weeks after I bought it I was taking it to the shop for hard shifting, and bucking. The dealership told me they just needed to ""reset"" it. So I went along with it. April its back in the shop and its worse this time. Take it back and again we ""reset"" it.  May came and the cars engine light came on, it stalls out in traffic and I almost get hit trying to take my son to school. Intake it back they say there is nothing wrong and they reset again. So this month my engine light came on driving to school. Took it to a mechanic and they read the code and it was the transmission. I had had enought I took it to the dealership and called Jeep. Everyone at Jeep in customer care was wonderful. The dealership told me it was a lemon they replaced parts and the engine light is still coming on. The GM of the dealership called and even told jeep it was a lemon. The mechanic, the service advisor everyone told them. So i got escalated in my case with Jeep. The case manager Ashley is the nastiness person I have spoken to at Jeep. She refused to replace my car, told me lies about things the dealership said, and she even told me she would fix my car several time but I was not getting a new one. I told her yesterday that my car is unsafe and i refused to drive and pay good money for a car that does not run correctly snd is unsafe. She said well thats not my problem you aren't getting another car. So i proceed to ask her ""so you want me to drive my 4 year old son around in an unsafe vehicle because Jeep will not replace me with a new safe working car?"" She said ""yes that is what I am telling you. I am sorry but if I do get in an accident with this Jeep I will be holding Jeep personally responsible as well as Ashley from case management. When I explained to her everything I was told by the dealership and the customer care and she went on to tell me that they were all misinformed and she was the only person whos decision mattered. She lied about what the GM is saying about my car and I know this because I have been speaking with them every day. I will be continuing to post this issue on the internet and social media until my issues are resolved to my request for a new working product. I love Jeep but this Ashley person has made a very bad impression on me as to the jeep name.",neg
"I bought my daughter a Jeep Cherokee Limited 2015 in Feb. loaded with every extra including Blind Spot, Lane Assit. 6 cyl.  u name it. Beginning of Sept. at 5000 miles the Transmission Failed while she was driving up steep hill where she lives- The Berkeley Hills, Berkeley Ca.   It suddenly lost power, red lights began to flash on dash. Luckily after braking and turning it off and restarting with no change , she put on Emergency Brake and jumped out.
She then had more problems with the dealership, taking it in. Eventually, I- her mother- had to get involved  (I do not live in the area) and make a number of calls to Sales people at the Daly City dealership where I bought the car. None of this went well. She was able to have the car towed a week later to the Berkeley, dealership where they diagnosed the problem: Transmission Failure and replaced the transmission and updated the software. They handled the situation well but now the car Lurches forward, out of the blue.  Both these problems have been noted in complaints to NHTSA, Automotive News and other Internet forums.

Purchased my brand new 2015 Cherokee limited in April and have not had anything but nightmares with it. First it is very uncomfortable. Then had my panorama roof leak while going through a car wash only to have the dealership tell me that the panorama roof is not designed to withstand a high pressure car wash or a heavy downpour rain! REALLY?  So since I don't own a garage I guess I should have ordered the tarp package to go with my new Cherokee!!! Give me a break Chrysler!!! The air bag light came on and the power drivers seat stopped working. All of this with less than 3500 miles on my Cherokee. I have it back at the dealership where I bought it for a second time for the roof leak. Chrysler never states in any of its manuals nor do they or the dealership disclose that the roof will leak. As far as I am concerned thus vehicle is a lemon and I will be fighting with Chrysler to just take the terrible thing back. My advice....go buy a chevrolet or a ford or shopping cart!!! Anything but the jeep Cherokee!,neg
"I have had my trailhawk  for under a year. RECALL, RECALL, RECALL, RECALL, ....  The check engine light came on with less than 11,000 miles, took it to dealer, they FIXED it, less than 24 hours later the check engine light was back on. Coasting down a hill the tachometer was bouncing all over the place. sounds like the rear axle or transmission is about to fall off when it down shifts. Problems trying to turn off the Jeep, put car in park, foot on brake, push button to turn car off and car still runs, try it again and again, cars still runs.  While talking to corporate office customer service, trying to resolve these issues, they were rude, hung up on me, and would not return phone calls. That was the last Jeep I will ever buy. Even the dealer I bought it from didn't want to take it back as a trade-in.",neg
"I'll keep it short - don't buy a Cherokee.  I bought a new 4 cyl. 2015 Cherokee and after driving it on the freeway for a few hundred miles the car started to have acceleration issues.  They claimed it was the transmission, it took them over 30 days to fix it, when I got it back it did the same thing again.  I then fought Chrysler & the Dealership for a replacement vehicle and after 4 months they gave me one (although I had to pay extra for the new one since it was a 6 cyl.) and the car is still unreliable and has issues.  The shifting between gears is weird, it is not smooth at all, the transmission frequently kicks, the car doesn't get out of gear sometimes and not to mention the 6+ recalls I've had in less than a year.  Yes it's a good looking car but it isn't worth it.  Don't buy one, I regret mine.",neg
"I knew the Jeep Cherokee was not given good marks for dependability, and apparently I drew the short straw. 

I purchased my 2015 Cherokee in May of 2015. Took a road trip 500 miles away and could not get the lift gate to close on the Sunday of Memorial Weekend. By the time Tuesday rolled around and the dealership was open, I had to have the car towed in. The dash display continuously showed a warning that the lift gate was open. The battery seemed to be hold charge, but by Tuesday morning, the car did not respond to the key fob and I could not get into the car. I used the mechanical key to open the door. The alarm went off, which I believe is normal. However, once inside the car, it would not respond to attempts to start the engine. There may be some ""trick"" that has to be done to clear the alarm when the key is used, but I could not find it anywhere in the very limited documentation and really was not in the mood to look through the dvd again after sorting through it since Sunday trying to figure out the first problem. The lift gate would still not close. Called a tow truck and had the car towed to the dealership. Once there.... everything worked fine. Asked the technician if they could run diagnostics to find what the underlying problem was. I mean.... UConnect was happy to send me emails telling me the lift gate was open and the alarm went off, you would think the data was stored and could be retrieved. Nope. Can't determine anything without the fault currently being active while at the dealership. Wonderful. Went home waiting for another iteration of frustration. 

In September, went to my golf league. Unloaded my clubs and locked the car. Realized I needed to get my sun glasses. The door would not open, didn't recognize the key fob. Used the key again. The alarm went off again. Could not start the car again. Called the dealership and asked if there was something I needed to do to reset after the alarm went off under those circumstances. They said no, I needed to have the car towed in. Called roadside services. Waited almost 2 hours for the tow truck. At that time, the car worked fine. Called dealership and asked, can you run diagnostics and let me know what happened. Of course not, the car has to be exhibiting the bad behavior for them to know what's going on. 

I am a single woman and a Realtor. I cannot afford a car that can randomly and unexpectedly not start. If the dealership won't even look at the car to figure out the problem, and I can't know I can get where I need to be 24/7; then this vehicle is unacceptable. I cut my losses and traded it in on a Ford.

I know electrical problems are tricky. And I know not all Cherokees will have this problem. But come on Jeep, figure out how to fix this crap to keep your loyal customers. (This is my third Jeep. First two were great. But, never again)",neg
"If I can get you to understand one thing and only one thing,  it's DO NOT get a Cherokee unless it has factory towing AND the Trailhawk package.  

You can't add towing later to a unit that doesn't have the factory tow package.     I wish someone had told me that. 

The Trailhawk is the only model that actually has recovery points, at all..  so if you slide off the road in snow or get stuck in mud (this is an SUV after all right?) there's seriously not one thing to hook a tow strap onto front or rear on non-trailhawks.    Nothing.    You're screwed.   

This is a useless car for a lot of reasons,  and the biggest purchase regret of my life but I won't go into all the things I loathe about it - just... if you absolutely have to buy one of these stupid cars at least insist on towing and Trailhawk or you'll have a sack of garbage like mine.",neg
"Can't really rate the vehicle being that I have only driven it a few days.  The sun roof did not work the day I bought it, it has been back at the dealership twice now and they cannot fix the problem.  They have had my car now for 6 days.  I just called the dealership Manager and told him I want a new car so he put in a claim for me.  We'll see what happens from here.",neg
"At 4000 miles breaks began to pulsate violently. dealer had to replace brake rotors. At the time of the brake repair I had mentioned to the service Manager of the erratic shifting and hesitation, but because there were no error codes the service dept shoved it off like no big deal. 3000 miles later check engine light with again erratic shifting. At one point transmission disengaged and engine reved to 5000 RPM. Back to the dealer, replaced PCM but said it was faulty, ordered and replaced with another PCM, but service Manager said that they could not reprogramm. It has been at the Dealership now for two weeks with no cure insight. They now have Chrysler Tech group working on the problem, but they too have been unsuccessful in figuring out the problem. Makes me feel all warm a fuzzy about driving this Vehicle again if they ever get it fixed. Of course the dealership offered to get me into another Vehicle but would have to add the $3500 negative equity in my jeep to the cost of a new Vehicle. This Vehicle is a danger on the road, and the BIGGEST LEMON I HAVE EVER OWNED!!!",neg
"My beautiful  Jeep is just no good.  Been in and out of dealer 5 times with same issues  with the transmission.   Every time they would re flash it and  say they can't  duplicate  the issues.  Just after 3 weeks of another reflashing my car shuts off while driving.  I opened a case with Chrysler  and thank god they agreed to buyback my Jeep.  Stay away from this Jeep, nothing but a nightmare!!!!",neg
"I had this car in the shop within the first 4000 miles with rough shifting. Something was done with the PCM and TCM controlls. Have since had it in there 3 additional times for the same issue, one was a warranty recall for the same as listed above, TCM/PCM. One time when I called to bring it in, I was asked if any type of service lights were on. When I told them no, I was told that the car is computerized so if no loght ia on, they couldn't do anything about it.  I was adamant and finally got an appointment. I have had a service advisor and service manager (different times) ride along with me. Both acknowledged the rough shifting. However, when I got my car back they told me they ""checked the codes"" and nothing came up. So they wanted me to come get my car. I paused after failed attempts to get my documentation only to finally getc it and it said ""unable to duplicate the concern."" I called back and requested the documentation from the times the service advisor and service manager did their different rid along with me. What do I get? ""Rode along and unable to duplicate the concern."" Both times they acknowledged my conce but documented otherwise. I have an open case with Diamler Chrysler and that is a joke as well. The case manager is no more interested in helping than the dealership. Not only am I having trouble with the rough shifting which I believe is the transmission I just had to have the struts replaced as my car started making a rattling noise withing the first 6 months of having it. 

This last effort to get my car fixed, I was told it is a computerized car and it will function the way that I drive it. Absolutley waste of my money and time! I have told everyone I can that this company and car is a joke!!",neg
"I have a 2015 Jeep Cherokee.  This is my 3rd Jeep product and after this one, I will NEVER buy another Chrysler product.  I started having transmission issues at about 5000 miles.  I took the car in several times and they did several updates on my transmission.  After telling me they ordered a part, I called back to see the status of the part, because my car was acting worse than ever...and I was advised that a whole new transmission had been ordered.  They put the new transmission in.  They told me they would have my car for 2 days...when in fact they had it for a week.  Didn't give me a loaner car or even offer.  Told me to take it easy on the transmission for the first 1000 miles or so.  At about 8000 miles, the car started to act up again.  Have had 2 more updates down, and the transmission is still very jerky. It doesn't shift right. Doesn't feel safe at all.  Every time I take it into the dealership, I get the run around and they make it seem like I am stupid and don't know what I'm talking about, even though I have already had a new transmission in my BRAND new Jeep.  I will NEVER buy another Chrysler product.  Trading in my Jeep Commander was the worst decision I have ever made.",neg
"8/17/17 - Not a fan of the Stop/Start function as now I have had to have it in the shop twice as it has not been working.  This car has vibrations and rattles in it like an old rattle trap car that is extremely annoying.   Also, when it automatically shifts at times it is very jerky and abrupt.  I would not buy this car again or recommend it to anyone.   

The main things I do not like is that there are tons of squeaks and noises in the car all the time.  Everything rattles and I don't like that. 
Again, when I first start the car if I don't wait minutes for it to warm up and just get going it lurches into gear like the transmission is going to jerk out of gear.  It is a terrible feeling and scares me at times.  It jerks so hard sometimes.  Overall, I am no longer as satisfied with this car and am not sure that I would purchase a jeep again.  I already had to have the battery replaced when it was only a year old.  I am thinking I will not be keeping this car for long.",neg

"I deeply regret purchasing the V6 4x4 Trailhawk 2015 Jeep.  After 2200 miles, the transmission is broken.  While driving on the interstate the check engine light came on, so we exited the interstate.  A service transmission message was displayed on the screen.  Upon stopping at the exit ramp light, the car would not move forward, although it was in drive.  The problem repeated again, one block away from the dealership where we took it for repair.  The car simply stops in traffic with little to no warning.  Prior to the sudden onset of this transmission problem, we had no issues with the vehicle.  When we arrived at the dealership, they indicated it would be at least a week before the transmission techs could even look at the vehicle as there is a glut of service inventory for transmission repairs.  After they look at the vehicle to get the specific failure code, we would then have to wait for our turn for repair as they are backlogged for transmission repairs.  We asked that they call other dealerships and find out if they can service it sooner, and every dealership within 75 miles is booked out WEEK(S) ahead for transmission repairs.  We looked up this model vehicle online and searched specifically for transmission failures, and our hearts sunk.  Many (hundreds of people) claim to be having what appears to be the same issue at very similar mileage (less than 6500 miles) on the Cherokee 9 speed transmissions.  We are disgusted with this purchase and the customer service we have experienced from Jeep.  I emailed Chrysler, per the instructions in the owner's manual, and have not received a response.  I have called the customer care department and have not received any support.  Jeep will not give us a loaner vehicle to use while they repair our brand new Trailhawk with 2200 miles on it that we paid $41k for.  I know these vehicles are visually appealing, have comfortable seating, have good acceleration and performance specs, but seriously, no car should have transmission failures at 2200 miles.  If you are still considering purchasing this vehicle after reading my review, I strongly urge you to spend a few minutes on the web searching car complaint sites for issues with the Cherokee transmission.  I deeply regret this purchase and would advise any friend or family member to purchase something different, based on this experience.  We have been without our brand new Jeep for some time now, the dealer has not contacted us, Jeep has not responded to our inquiries, Chrysler has not responded, and there appears to be no end in sight.  I would never purchase this vehicle again under any circumstance, despite how much we love the appearance and comfort.",neg
"I bought my V6 4x4 Latitude last week, and I already regret it. The first issue was the suspension creaking while at a stop and turning the wheel. The second, is that the UConnect system is a pile of fancy garbage. It disconnects my phone, won't put calls though the speakers, doesn't recognize an iPhone as a USB device, drops SiriusXM connection frequently, radio has a lot of static, it's a nightmare to use. The third I have is the drivers seat sounds like a squeaking spring when I move, or go around corners. You have to shut off active start every single time you start the vehicle. The leather on the steering wheel is paper thin. My tow eyelet's missing. Transmission can't find a happy spot",neg
"I have 10,000 miles on mine. I would be very cautious before purchasing. The transmission is more of an issue than they are admitting too. The poor shifting makes this car extremely dangerous. The hesitation in downshifting makes everyday driving very deangerous. If you get the sunroof prepare for it to rattle and creak every day without a solution to fix it. FCA calls both issus operating as normal.",neg
Bought a 2015 Jeep Cherokee Limited in January 2015 in May we drove to Washington DC for a move. While driving the check engine light came on and then wouldnt  go over 35. Imagine driving 35 in DC traffic keeping an eye on the RPMS which was up to 4 RPMs and making sure it did not get hot.  Before we started our trip I took it in to take care of the recall on transmission/ air bags. The Dealership in DC told us we needed a new transmission. We picked it up two days later and while driving home in DC traffic I took a left hand turn and the vehicle automatically turned right. It took all my strength and my husband to get the car to a safe place. Power steering connection wire came loose.  ,neg
"I have had my jeep into the dealership for transmission issues 4 times.  The dealer couldn't fix the transmission so they replaced it.  The new transmission is not much better and Jeep is unwilling to rectify the situation.  I am now forced to file a case with NCDS in an attempt to resolve this matter.  Looking at lemon law with a lawyer.  The vehicle has less than 3,000 miles on it.  This is the worst vehicle I have ever owned in 30+ years.",neg
"Firstly, I have the V6 model Trailhawk.  It was a great car for the first 11000 miles but then one day I received an RO1 recall notice for a software reprogramming.  Don't do it.  This reprogramming disables second gear because they know there is a serious design flaw with the transmission.  The recall reprogramming limits the down shifting of the tranny so you end up with a car that is always in the wrong gear and a herky jerky pig to drive.
  I once rated this car with 5 stars but feel compelled to warn the public now because so far Chrysler appears to be unwilling and very uncaring to restore this vehicle to what I paid for.
Update:
This Cherokee was long ago dumped, traded for a 2016 Subaru Outback 3.6r.  The Jeep was a ridiculous Lemon, an absolute swindle and worst purchase of my 64 years.  The 4WD would always disable and FCA disabled 2nd gear, making it pig to drive  
So far my current Outback is a far superior vehicle and much better off road and on.  I already have 23,000 on it.",neg
"Bought a new Jeep Cherokee 2015 Ltd FWD putting in 4293 miles.Recalled for the 1st month of owning it for a P56 Recall(Tranny reprogram).2 months after, the engine check light turned-on with only over 1000 miles on it.Brought it back to a dealer to have it check and only restarted the fault and dealer informed me, it should good.On its 4th month owning it, it happened again with transmission temp. going over 258Deg with a 7 error codes according from an OBD II.Brought it to the closes dealer and was told that they had to order a new transmission. Up to now, still waiting for it to get fix.Called the Jeep Co. and ask for a replacement.Jeep cant give me an answer until it is fix.Disappointing!",neg
"Very disappointing experience! Leased the Jeep Cherokee 2015 without knowing there has been a history of transmission issues. Found that out after the car died on the highway. My Jeep had been skipping gears,running sluggish and hesitating but I never imagined it could be a problem with the transmission. I waited over 3 hours for the Chrysler Road Side Assistance to show up and tow me to the nearest dealer, it took 3 days to get an approved rental while they replace my transmission. My biggest regret is I still have 2 1/2 years on the lease. ",neg
"2015 models with v6 engine idle rough and have an automatic engine stop switch that shuts engine off at stop lights. Wear and tear on starter over the life of the car must be significant. Had ours at dealership for four days with 575 miles only to be told the rough idle is the nature of the vehicle and is normal operation. We drove at least four more Cherokees and all had the rough idle, some worse than ours. It is so bad that we traded back at a substantial loss just to get out of it. Beware, if you test drive a v6 Cherokee, make sure to drive it enough to get it to operating temperature and observe the automatic shut down and then put it in park and check the idle. Good luck after that!",neg
I have always had dodge products and this 2018 is the worst! Doesn’t start properly it’s been in the shop more then I have drove it! Now it has a device on it to try and find out what’s wrong with it? They think it’s my phone ?,neg
"I bought a brand new 2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee, It has 2501 miles on it, and it's in the shop waiting for a new motor,  that is on back order for 2 months.  Problems with the block, had some manufacturer errors, there are some bubbles in the casting.  The oil of course leaked out these bubbles.  Called the Jeep company, I get a case number and told I will be called back, on the next business day. Still haven't received a return call.

Finally heard back from the Jeep (Chrysler) Company, Talked to the Case Manager.  The engine was expedited and the shop received the motor in about 3 days, instead of 2 months.  I let them know I was very unhappy and I wanted to trade this vehicle for another new vehicle because I did not want to deal with potential future problems after replacing the motor.  Needless to say, that didn't happen. I was basically told that they would do nothing more, no swapping it for another vehicle, no buying it back, unless it became a legal matter.  But I was more than welcome to talk to the sales department of one of their dealers and see what kind of deal they could do for me. (So basically trade it in).   I went and picked up the Jeep, and traded it in is exactly what I did, and it wasn't with a Chrysler Corporation.  I will never buy any kind a vehicle from the Chrysler Corporation again.",neg
"First off I love the Jeep Grand Cherokee brand. I had a 2003 and I decided to upgrade to a 2018. I was impressed by the upgrades, but that didn't last when about a week or two later I got an engine light on. Just before that the radio and navigation system shut down while driving without prompting. The SUV shut down after remote starting. Then the remote start app didn't always work. I tried to get assistance but there was no support. Then the jeep shut down after key remote start, sometimes it would not start with key remote start or it would shut down after getting in the vehicle. Driving back on a 20 miles trip the jeep smelled like it  was on fire to the point I stopped. After the 4th time taking it to the service department without a resolution I am trying to get my money back. I am so heart broken and disappointed in the brand.",neg
"My lease was up this summer and needed to lease a new car. The jeep met all my requirements on options. I went with the Overland model to get the safety features. Yep, if you want safety you have to pay extra!  That should have been my red flag.   Heated seats are standard, blind spot is not.  The first week I noticed the auto restart causes the car to either lose power or over excelerate randomly. Of course I can't get it to do it (or they don't believe me) at the dealership. Randomly the transmission shifts so hard it feels like it's coming through the back of the car. Now that it is summer the heated seats don't heat. Takes 30 minutes to heat if they do at all. Also, the outside temp gauge seems to be faulty. It read 105 degrees on a 60 degree day.  Can't wait to trade it in.",neg
"Purchased the 5.7 liter hemi  version September 30, 2016. As of October 30, 2017 I am completely dissatisfied with the build quality. 4WD system required two trips and one week in the shop. Rusting(!!!) roof was initially declined by Chrysler's warranty department, they have since changed their mind. The vehicle is a little over a year old and has less than 15k miles. Once I finally get my Jeep back this week, I'm headed straight to a Honda dealer to buy a reliable vehicle. I have nothing good to say about my failed experience with Jeep/Chrysler.",neg
"This is my 3rd Grand Cherokee and I am highly disappointed.  I have a 2017 Grand Cherokee Summit that I've had for 13 - 14 months.  There have been 3 recalls and this weekend I received an ""air suspension warning"".  The back of the Jeep is now sitting below the rear tires with the drivers side rear tire bent inwards while the front of the vehicle is sitting about 4-inches above the tires.  When leasing or purchasing a $55,000.00 vehicle one should expect to not have ANY issues within the first year to 3 years.  I lease new vehicles so that I don't have to experience mechanical issues.  I put in anywhere between 60 - 70 hours in the office every week and it is very difficult to miss work to have to deal with these issues.  I really should try to bill them for my time!  With this Summit I am averaging 1 issue very 3.25 months which is ridiculous. I have always highly recommend the Grand Cherokee but I doubt I will anymore.  Once my lease ends, I probably switch to an Audi.  The Summit simply isn't reliable!  Forgot to mention, I have a whopping 12,000 miles of which half are turnpike miles between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia.",neg
"After discussion with many jeep drivers, I was excited to get into one. I bought the 2016 Grand Cherokee Limited Edition 75th Anniversary Edition. After three times into the dealership for the same issue, we finally settled on it being a lemon. Here's the problem. The CAM sensor doesn't work and at the ignition start sets off your engine light and other issues. There weren't parts to fix it and had to wait. Finally was able to get into a 2017-same edition thinking it was just this one. After only owning for one week, back in the shop with the exact same issue. They fixed it by putting in new diffusers. I have been back on the road for less than two weeks, same issue has come up again. Two brand new jeeps and the same issue. They say there aren't issues with this edition but seriously, two in less than a year with the exact same issue. I have been patient and trying to work with the dealership on this. I have lost all confidence in the jeep brand. Great to hear that so many individuals out there are having a great experience with the brand. It just must not be for me. Watch out for the 75th edition release.",neg
"The Jeep in extremely unreliable. The transmission tries to predict how you want it work, but what ends up happening is shifting from 0 gear to 1st (roughly 0-10 mph) there is a pretty hard shift. The transmission ends up struggling, and I'm sure it will go out much faster than it should because of the terrible transmission technology they created. I took my Jeep in for this issue 3 times and was told that that's just what is does and the best they can do is hope if my transmission does go out it happens before the warranty is up. Seriously! The Limited 75th edition also has 20 inch wheels when the wheel well is made for 18 inches. That means that the tires have to be low profile to fit. So, make sure not to use the Jeep for long car trips or take it off road (you know the main reasons to buy a Jeep)! The 20 inch rims and performance tires ruin the usability of the Jeep. I've had my Jeep 11 months and I've had 3 tires blow out. I've never had a tire blow out on any other vehicle I've had, and I've had more than 10 vehicles. I would never recommend this vehicle and I'm working on trading mine in now. I loved the Jeep brand but after buying a 2016 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited 75th Anniversary Edition, I can honestly say I will never buy a Jeep again.",neg
"Have had my 2016 Jeep Grand Cherokee Overland High Altitude for not even a year and have had so many different issues. First I started having issues with my shifter upon start up, the lights on the shifter would not turn on so the communication between that and the dash would not allow me to shift and then after a short amount of time they would pop on and service shifter would pop up in my instrument cluster along with the check engine light. Took it to the dealer and of course they could not replicate so hey just give it back to me and wait for it to happen again. Well it did so I took it back and yet again they would not do anything so they gave it back happened the next day so I recorded what happened so they couldn't give me grief. They finally replaced my shifter after initially wanting to tear apart my transmission for something else even though there was an open recall for other cars but of course mine was not included even though it did the same thing. Hadn't even hit 10k on the odometer at this point. After 5k miles what a shock it happened again and again the shopnwanted to tear apart my transmission and Jeep said no put a flight recorder in. So after a month it still hadn't happened now the dealer kept calling and harassing me to get the recorder back and I can just come back again after it happens again. During this time I had to have a taillight replaced because it cracked from the inside, dealer told me to call Jeep because they weren't going to risk a charge back. Also have had a plastic molding on the door start to fall of since it's smart to hold pieces of a car together with double sided tape and also a panel in the cargo area was warped. I have also had my auto windshield wipers malfunction twice and also my esc light has come on twice now along with another check engine light for I can't even remember what. I had to go to the dealer and upgrade my warranty to lifetime since I paid so much for this piece of junk I had to cover my ass for the long haul. Still no resolution for my shifter issues who knows what will ever happen with that or all the other issues that keep happening. This is the last fca product I will ever buy.",neg
"The vehicle basically started falling apart at 4,000 miles; multiple trips to the service department at the dealership, out of the last 6 months it has spent 38 days (and counting) in the service department. There is something wrong in the electronics/software with these vehicles. Jeep & Chrysler offer no help - in their own words ""we cannot do anything"".",neg
"Sitting on the side of the highway just an hour ago with no power and I haven't even received my payment book yet:(  I really want to like this car, but sitting dangerously close to speeding traffic in the sweltering summer heat is really dulling my enthusiasm. When it runs, life is good. Life is hell when it doesn't. 

On Edit: After two weeks at the dealership, the problem could not be found. The dealer gave us another new Grand Cherokee with the same options. Chrysler gave us an extended warranty on the replacement car. We are happy with the new Jeep. The old one is still out there and the problem was never diagnosed. The dealer is using it as his daily driver and being diligent in witnessing the problem first hand.",neg
"I had a Dodge Durango for a few years and since it was almost out of its extended warranty I figured get a new Jeep.  What a mistake that was.  After owning for only two weeks the car spent 11 days at a dealer for the following problems:  Faulty paint on the spoiler, Extreme wind noise, clunk noise when going over speed bumps, clothing hanger loose & rattling.   They repainted the spoiler, replaced the two front door rubber seals, a front & rear shocks were leaking so they replaced the front shock (rear shock is on extreme backorder, whatever that means because no one knows), replaced clothes hanger.  Well, after 11 days at the dealer, the wind noise issue is not resolved as once I hit 50+ miles per hour, I can't hear anything inside the car and the clunk noise when going speed bumps is still there.  I even made sure that the technician had driven over a bump to ensure the problem was actually the leaking shock.  I'm not sure how he couldn't hear the clunk as it's as loud as it can be.  So, now I have to go back to the dealer and leave my car for God knows how many more days there.  Now the headrests on both seats have started rattling every time going over rough road.  I haven't even made my first payment yet and I'm already disgusted with the car.

Update:  took the vehicle back to the dealer.  It sat there for another 5 days (now total of 16 days at dealer).  Apparently it were the two front shocks leaking & not the rear, bad communication from the service adviser.  They replaced the second front shock.  Clunk noise is still there.  Technician couldn't replicate the wind noise, so we took a ride and then he heard how loud it was and agreed it wasn't normal.  Next step is to wait for a Chrysler representative to come out, test drive the car and do a cabin pressurizing test to see where the air is leaking from (I'm not sure how you can pressurize a cabin when there are so many vents located all over).  This keeps getting better and better.

2nd Update:  Vehicle back at the dealer.  The clunk noise is still there.  Took a ride with the technician and went over small bumps at about 5 miles per hour and you could hear the noise.  His suggestion: driver over them slower!!!!!!!!!! I suggested maybe I should get out of the car & push it over the speed bump.  After all aren't Jeeps suppose to be off-road vehicles and yet they can't handle a small shopping center speed bump.  The wind noise still there, apparently the technician made the whole thing up about a Chrysler representative coming out and doing the whole pressurizing the cabin thing, because according to the service manger that never happens and Chrysler reps never come out.  So, now I'm back in my cheap piece of junk, dirty loaner car for the 3rd time this month, crossing my fingers that they will actually fix these problems on a car that I paid well over $40k for.",neg

The entire touch screen was replaced, no problems since.  Next the transmission was recalled due to a software update.  The Jeep would sometimes still be in D when people thought it was parked.  Sounds ridiculous but it actually happened to me once while I was jumping a friends car off in front of me.  I almost rolled forward and hit their car.  So this week the evaporation vent solenoid is being replaced.  I was receiving a check engine light warning.  Inititally, I was told the gas cap probably was just left open.  They reset it and I went on my way, after I was on my way, I realized hmmm, there is no gas cap.  So a week later, back in the shop getting this repaired.  While they were fixing that, I asked the service adviser to check the AC.  It's makes this weird depressurization noise about every 20 seconds.  They found a leak in the compressor, it is being replaced.  Now, all these problems have been covered under warranty so far.  I have 31k miles on the vehicle at this point and I take meticulously good care of my cars.  I guess I'm stuck wondering what will happen when it's not under warranty?  Yeah, stay clear.

Since purchasing a Jeep Grand Cherokee in April of 2015 the forward collision warning system has engaged approximately 6-10 times, with flashing lights, warning on the dash and audible alarms when a vehicle traveling a good length in front of my Jeep was turning right and I was going straight on a city street. Although it has been an adrenaline raising situation I had not had it in for service just because of the hassle of doing so. On February 16, 2017 the vehicle crash avoidance system and brake mitigation engagement which included flashing lights, a warning on the dash, audible alarms and now abrupt, hard sustained braking occurred on a highway at 55 mph. I was nearly rear ended, as there was no reason for this very abrupt, hard braking. I immediately took it to the dealer, Transit Town Jeep in Williamsville, NY where I had purchased it, for service. Of course, all systems checked out fine. The next day following my service visit the same thing happened with all the alarms, lights and abrupt hard braking, (slamming on the brakes) but this time there had been no vehicle in front of me or anywhere around. I was on a two lane rural road traveling at 45mph with no vehicle approaching in the oncoming lane and no parked vehicles on either side of the road. There were no objects on the shoulder or side of the road. There was absolutely nothing to set this “safety system” off. It's very stressful driving a vehicle that may brake hard at any moment for no reason and you have absolutely no control. I took the vehicle back to the same dealer and we went through the same process. After four days, on February 24th the dealer informed me again that nothing could be found to be wrong and that I should pick up my vehicle. The vehicle is still at Transit Town Jeep, as it is not safe to drive. On February 24th I called the FCA Customer Assistance Center and opened a claim. By March 8th I was notified there was no problem with the vehicle, because the technicians could not get the vehicle to engage the anti-collision system while they test drove it.

As of today, March 10, the vehicle sits in my driveway as it is a safety hazard. If I were traveling 55 mph with a tractor trailer or large truck behind me and this system engaged, I would probably not live to complain about it. I have 14 months left on a lease that they will not let me out of, so I am stuck.

In researching this dangerous safety issue I have learned that this exact problem has happen to others beginning in 2014. It is not a common occurrence; therefore there has been no official recall by Chrysler. It’s interesting that there does not seem to be a remedy either.

I have also learned that if you choose to use this collision avoidance system in your vehicle, you need to turn it on each and every time the vehicle is started. I have never “turned this feature on”, which leads me to ask why is this system dangerously and improperly engaging when it isn’t even turned on? Jeep has  not stood behind their product and have given no indication that they are at all concerned about this vehicles safety hazard.",neg
"The CVT engine in this car diminishes the value. Don't get me wrong this IS a nice vehicle for the price - but you have NO confidence when merging onto traffic or getting out of a slow lane. No confidence. The engine has many flat spots when accelerating, or when you move forward after a stop. The transmission is still thinking..... I had a whirling noise in my engine that Jeep could NEVER fix. I brought it to them two or three times complaining of the same thing. Customer service was almost as bad as Subaru. Rude, condescending managers that have so many vehicles in line to be worked on that they forgot they gave me a loaner car. Forgot.",neg
"Purchasing this car was the biggest mistake I've ever made!  Buyer beware - read the reviews/complaints before spending all this money on a vehicle that has so much hesitation on acceleration that I'm pretty sure I'm going to get killed.  A vehicle is suppose to move forward when pressing on the gas peddle. Instead the engine rev's really loud like I'm in a plane taking off but your still not going anywhere.  In the meantime, the window of opportunity to pull out is quickly decreasing because of oncoming traffic (to the point where I would no longer feel safe in doing so) Then the car finally reacts and lurches forward throwing everyone back in their seats.  To oncoming traffic and passengers in my car, it looks like I'm pulling out at the last minute and cutting them off.  This happens during All accelerations, back streets and highway driving.  I brought it back to the dealer and took the service manager for a drive and his response was that's normal! He confirmed that it drives this way but to say it's NORMAL is unacceptable. I have a 2015 Grand Cherokee Overland and will trade it as soon as possible!",neg
Traded mine in with just over 20k miles.  Simply the least reliable vehicle I've ever owned.  Traded in for a Subaru and couldn't be happier.,neg

"In the Fall of 2014 we purchased a 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee Summit and our purchase decision was based primarily on the high level of satisfaction we had from purchasing a 2012 Grand Cherokee Summit in the Fall of 2011. Simply put, we were very satisfied Jeep customers as the 2012 had exceeded all of our expectations at that time. It was a stunningly beautiful vehicle, well designed and performed flawlessly over the first three years of ownership. The 2012 had experienced only two service required issues. One to replace a prematurely wearing seat bottom (warranty at 20,000 miles) and the second a failed heat diverter (owner cost, out of warranty). Other than that it was gas, oil and go for over 100,000 miles in a little under 3 years.

At this point (Fall of 2015) we decided to replace my wife's 2013 Chevrolet Silverado extended cab 4x4 with a second Summit and became the proud owners of a new Grey one but this time equipped with the Hemi V8. This upgrade in power really changed the performance of the Grand Cherokee positively and surprisingly only resulted in around a 2 mpg loss in fuel economy which was quite amazing. Most of our driving with both Jeeps is purely highway and the V6 averages around 24.5 while the V8 comes in at around 22.5 with both running at around 70 mph on relatively flat terrain. This sadly is where the good news ends.

It is hard to believe that these two vehicles were built in the same factory. The difference in quality is immediately quite evident. Paint quality on the 2015 is quite frankly ""poor"". Botchy and thin paint gives the vehicle a mottled look...as a matter of fact the factories inability to produce a quality paint finish caused them to cease production on several colors during the 2015 model year. This vehicle came new from the factory with more squeaks, rattles and strange noises than our 2012 had after 100,000 miles of driving. After a couple of months ownership the navigation system began giving false readings and this defect spread into all functions within the radio, navigation, heater A/C screen finally culminating in all functions in-operative and a pure black screen. It took numerous ""Updates"", trips to 4 different dealers and finally a complete radio/nav, heater A/C module and screen replacement authorized by Jeep Engineering in Detroit to remedy. During one service attempt the Jeep was in a dealership out of service for almost 2 weeks...not a ringing endorsement for an almost $60,000 vehicle....!!!!!

Moving on, the 8 speed transmission exhibits a nasty habit of refusing to upshift through the gears from a dead stop. Upon accelerating it stays firmly in 1st gear and will only come out after pulling over, putting the vehicle into park and then attempting to drive forward through the gears again. Updates to this point have failed to cure the issue. This leads into the electronic gear shift itself. Quite frankly, it is a very dangerous feature of this generation Jeep Grand Cherokee and has been changed completely for the 2016 model year. The chances of a failed complete move to park has resulted in injuries to Jeep owners exiting their vehicle thinking it is park when it is in fact in reverse. A very poor design since eliminated by Jeep.

Summing up the 2015 Summit I can only say it is an enigma for sure. We want very much to love it especially with the performance of the Hemi V8 which makes it a really fun SUV to drive. Additionally the size and configuration of a SUV and in particular this SUV is perfect for our use. But, the issues we have had with the vehicle are not what we expected from a highly awarded and expensive vehicle.

If I may, I would like to shift gears (pardon the pun) back to the 2012 Summit. Shortly after buying the 2015 the ""engine warning light"" on the dash of the 2012 came on and a distinct engine misfire became evident. A trip to the Jeep dealer netted a diagnosis of a failed cylinder head which was a defect in the early V6 Pentastar engines and which is covered by a Jeep/Chrysler extended warranty (150,000 miles). All costs involved in replacing the left side cylinder head are covered by this extended warranty but this dealership added additional repairs (which I agreed to) and which added an ""out of pocket"" expense of over $600.00 to the engine repair. Also the 2012 GC had developed an annoying rattle in the rear end which they diagnosed as worn and loose shock absorbers that they replaced at a cost of $700.00 (again authorized my myself). Now if the cost of shock replacement wasn't bad enough, when the vehicle was picked up the rattle was still there. Not to mention that when I checked part pricing for the shock absorbers themselves, the OEM shocks they installed cost $138.00 each while a neighboring Jeep dealer quoted them at $96.00 They claim their dealership has its own part pricing matrix. Simply put, the poor quality was bad enough but the recent servicing we experienced cost Jeep a customer...we have purchased our last Jeep product.",neg
"I purchased my Jeep  2015 Grand Cherokee Laredo last September 2015, and I was very happy about it cause I was purchasing an American made vehicle. It was my first jeep. After driving for one day, I went back to the dealership service department to find out what that little motor sounding noise was under the hood. Don't you know that no one there could tell me what it was? This sound comes and goes and I was stuck living with it thinking it was just something normal about it. Then after driving for a week or two, I felt as thought I was driving a manual car. When slowing down and coming to a stop, the transmission would shift kind of weird. As it was shifting down and I could feel that jerky motion it in my head and it was making me motion sick. This went on for a while and I wasn't sure what to do. So I took it to service where it was determined that my car needed a ""software update"". But after getting my car back, it was back to the same old thing. So I wrote to jeep about the problem and was told to take it back to service. So I did just that and I had two service people drive with me while I drove my car. The first person tried to blame the problem on the road surface. But then the second person, who told me that he too experienced motion sickness during his life and he drove with me and I told him about the transmission and how it was kind of jerky when I slow and brake to a stop. He told me that Jeep had changed their transmission to eight speed and that eventually will be going to a nine speed transmission. And these are his words, ""the new transmission is more jerky"". I had to agree with him. So after this, Jeep consumers office contacted me and told me that they were unable to help me because my car was okay and there was nothing to repair. What a joke I thought. I spend all this money for a lousy car that I thought was high quality when in fact it wasn't. Since I couldn't drive this car anymore, I had to trade it in for a more reliable ""Japanese"" car and I know I'll be happy with it. And at lease I won't have to get ""software updates"" for it. I'm so happy with that. Jeep, you're history for me!!!",neg
"Test the shifting lever which is electronic, when shifting from park to drive 90% of the time if goes to ""N"". When shifting from ""D to ""P"" it will stop at ""R"" and if you are not careful and double check the shifter and try to turn the motor off prior to getting out the car will start moving backwards.  The dealer tells me they all operate this way.  I have owned many Jeep Cherokee over the years and this will be the last.  Not good at all. 

Correction this is a 2015 model

Its made by Fiat. 8 speed transmission a joke. Hemi engine the only saving factor. Electronics very poor compared to 2011 vehicle. Unable to fix problems with electronics .

"Friend bought a 2006 GC brand new that I fell in love with. It was a basic model but did have the 4x4 and towing packages. 9 years later and now that I could afford one, I bought a 2015. I wish I would have had the opportunity and had at least a two day test drive period. First of all Fiat has cheapened the exterior by eliminating the dual exhausts and adding that ugly plastic trim along the bottom. Next the Uconnect  is a nightmare especially since the heated seats and other options aren't controlled by a physical knob. The dash squeaks so I know as my Jeep ages these squeaks will become really annoying. The steering wheel is too thick, your hands become sore after a long drive. Even with the lumbar and other seat controls, your back is sore after two or more hours of constant driving.  Cheap interior trim and my leather seats are starting to crack in the FL heat and humidity.  The dealer just repaired my transmission.... others have had the same problem... and now the A/C compressor is bad. It keeps recycling every 15 seconds as if there is not enough refrigerant in the system. Anyone who is really serious about buying this model or other Chrysler Fiat models, read the Consumer Report reviews. You'll change your mind in an instant.  As with all Chrysler products, their styling is stuck in the mid 2000's.",neg
"I really wanted to like the Jeep Grand Cherokee. Having come from a similarly sized SUV that treated us well for 12 years, I really wanted to upgrade our technology and other features we didn't have. The dealer let me take the Jeep home for 24 hours to decide. Unfortunately the Jeep drives poorly -- it rolls severly in turns and is not quick or zippy like you'd think given the engine. It also drives like a car much bigger than it is. It doesnt help that the steering wheel is incredibly thick. I dont know how any one would want to drive this day in and day out. It's really too bad because the Jeep does come with a TON of features and is a great value for what you get, from that aspect. And the Jeep LOOKS good. Recommendation is to really make sure you've given it a proper test drive before buying. I was *this* close to buying but decided to take the dealer's offer to drive it for a day.",neg

"I guess you could say I was almost completely satisfied with my Summit until some one crashed into me.  That was March 30th and my car still has not been returned to me!  Why? Because Jeep cannot fix the air ride!  Dealership repair people tell me once an air ride goes out in a vehicle its a usually is a continual nightmare.  However Jeep say's it can be fixed, so why has it taken close to 5 months and they don't seem to be any closer to fixing it.  So, the person's insurance does not want to total it since they feel it should be Jeeps problem to fix it.

"I took delivery of my new 2015 Grand Cherokee Limited this week. Unfortunately, I failed to notice that for 2015, Jeep has eliminated the sporty dual exhausts for the Limited, which is very surprising for their most popular selling model.  Aesthetics were part of my decision for the Grand Cherokee and this is a horrible design decision by Jeep. It cheapens the look of the high-end Limited model down to an ordinary Laredo and ruins the symmetry of the car from the back. Having just shelled over $45K for a Limited, I expected better.

"Vehicle: 2017 XLE 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 8AT 8 spd transmission) We purchased a new 2017 Highlander XLE after comparing it to several other vehicles in its class. Toyota touts quality and safety features as their biggest sales pitch, seems its there every time we turn on a tv. The transmission problem occurred at 8,253 miles, lucky for my wife, she was at a red light when the transmission failed and nobody was injured. The vehicle was hauled to local Toyota dealer on a flatbed & sat at the dealership for 52 days. We were told by dealer that a new transmission was back-ordered from California. After picking up the vehicle I noticed the work order stated part number 30510-48600-84 REMAN ATM and CORE RETURN. Re-manufactured parts should not be used to repair a brand new vehicle under factory warranty, which hasnt seen its first oil change. The day after picking it up I drove the vehicle around and excessive power train noise was present. Vehicle went back the the shop & they replaced both front wheel bearings at 8,392 miles and it sat in the shop another 3 days. Neither one of these repairs should occur on any new vehicle or a vehicle under 100,000 for that matter.

"2017 Jeep Grand Cherokee Overland, 4x4, 5.7L Hemi, all available advanced safety technology. Had for 9 months, 20,000 miles. Decision factors: Real 4wd, flat cargo floor, advanced safety technology, wifi, big enough to put knees at point of impact in most crashes (I was an ER nurse.) and fast enough to be safe getting on highway. Had to be American brand. This is long, but I gained much from other reviews and hope my views help someone else. Considered: Another Tahoe; Jeep replacing 10+yo one that I dearly love, but lack of available flat cargo floor and rough ride sadly put new Tahoe out of running. Mercedes, loved it, was cheaper than Jeep, but insurance would have been 180 per month higher than Jeep. (Or my Corvette!!!) Insurance company said avoid, Porsche, Mercedes, Audi, Mini Cooper and Volvo as all would be high. Hated the BMW, nothing good to say about it. Liked the Murano, but lack of 4WD made me take off short list. Initially did not consider FCJ products due to horrible J.D. Powers quality rating, but after extensive research, on sites like this, I found the GC was not a problem vehicle. I expressed my concern to dealer and I bought a bumper to bumper 100K after-market warranty for a lot less than Chevy sells one. I am not a fan of these warranties, and know they are usually not a good investment, but this one was very reasonable, and from an insurance company I have known of. Hope I dont regret it, but got me over my fears of this brand. (Read update below.) Pros. Advanced safety technology is awesome. Cheap insurance costs. Adjustable ride height is great, because I am short and makes getting in easy. Hemi in sport mode is really fun; just dont look at gas gage. Very nimble, short turning radius makes it very nice in tight parking garages which I have to traverse daily. Flat cornering with very little body roll. Panoramic moon roof makes interior feel larger. Initial fit and finish very good. Overall nice manners, nothing in drive-ability I would change. Controls familiar and easy to use. Good rear visibility even with headrests up. Heated steering wheel great, didnt think needed but really enjoying. Flat cargo floor. Excellent rear camera. Ventilated seats. Cargo area good size for big dog. Cons. Uncomfortable seats. (Seems to be a trend, and all but the Murano had these hard seats.) Gas mileage, I am not using eco mode. (Gas mileage climbing, after 3,000 miles up to 21mpg in mixed driving.) Wants mid-grade fuel. U-Connect; after 4 different techs, finally got iPhone 6s linked, but multiple phones a nightmare. Doesnt consistently work, and sometimes hangs up on callers it doesnt answer when using phone alone when in car. Cant text, cant use voice commands. Tech said not compatible with latest iOS, but were hopeful there would be upgrade soon. (REALLY? Considering the demographics of a GC buyer this is inexcusable. This is the primary reason for my lower overall rating and if I had known how bad it is, since this is my office, I might have chosen another vehicle.) Do not believe CNET review. U-Connect is horrible. Wifi through Sprint; was advised it wasnt very good by tech support and couldnt do what I needed because even with unlimited data it is only 3G and poor coverage. (? Think, know is a lower level service.) Told 2017 GC wasnt compatible with Pandora, even though has app, and after tech support couldnt make work, I was able to make work. Our Chevy is through t-Mobile and as good as TWC at home but does have data limits. Chevys My Link is far better and easier to use. I wish I had bought the stereo upgrade, like Bose in Chevys which is MUCH better. Wish had more ports for auxiliary equipment. Bad blind spot created by driver side A pillar and mirror. Carpet looks cheap. Rear hatch should be operated electrically, and advised not to shut manually, which took some training to get the dog to stay back while it slowly closes, and it doesnt always work. (It is having some issues, but dont know if it is the dogs bed pushing on it or something else I have on the floor causing this.) In conclusion: I am into cars, and wish I was more excited about this very expensive vehicle, but when I am asked how I like it, I respond its growing on me, probably partly due to my expectations. I have to remind myself this is a tool for my job and was the logical choice for me at this time. My vehicle is my office and I have to be able to get to see patients regardless of conditions. Even though very expensive, in my book, it doesnt scream you have money, so if you are looking for prestige, this isnt your vehicle, which is good in my line of work. If you are considering this vehicle, when you test drive it make sure you test it in regular, eco and sport mode. It is three different vehicles. I found out when took delivery of my ordered vehicle it was in regular mode, but I had test drove demo in sport mode. When I changed mode to sport, I was much happier; throatier exhaust notes and throw you back in the seat acceleration. (I did the adult thing and switched back to regular mode when I saw effect on gas-mileage.) Even if the GC is not your final choice, please consider getting a vehicle with advanced safety technology. We are so sold on it after only two months we are considering trading my husbands near new Silverado for one with the technology, we feel it is that important. It does take some getting used to, like trying to get through a skinny ATM lane, but has proven very valuable already. Hope it will be mandatory on all cars in a few years. Update: After 9 months of fighting with FCA about iphone to Uconnect problem, I am trading the vehicle. They just dont care and have admitted iphone isnt compatible with Uconnect even though they advertise it is. My car is my office so this is critical for my productivity.",neg

This is a nice car I like the looks of it. The ride is good a little on the hard side but it handles good because of it. Visibility is very good much better then the other SUVs I tried. The interior is very roomy and the seats are supportive. You set up high In the seats that helps with the visibility. The rear seats are comfortable but they dont fold all the way to front seats and dont fold as easy as my CRV. The car has good power for a 2.5 better then my CRV. And the CVT is much better then I expected it does take time to get used to. Gas mileage is good 29 to 30 on the highway and about 19 to 22 in town.

"The short block was replaced at approx 18K miles because it failed the oil consumption test (bad rings- Subaru extended warranty to 100K for oil consumption issues).

The short block was replaced again at approx 22K miles. Noise went away. At the next oil change (28K miles), the oil level was right near the top of the dipstick.

"I purchased my 2017 Honda CRV Touring AWD in June 2017. The day I went to take delivery the salesman was doing his walk around with me and showing me how to operate the car. They were all ready to let me drive off the lot when I pointed out that the drivers seat bolster was malformed and deflated. The mechanic comes out and says they never saw anything like that. So I take the car home and make an appointment to drop it off so they can disassemble the seat to find out what is wrong. After 3 days they get the parts and put the seat back together. I go to pick it up. They seat is ok. Not perfect and the nice tan leather interior is covered in black greasy hand prints. So they bring another guy out to clean it. Which should have been done before I even got there. Fast forward 6 months and it is time for the 5000 mile check up and oil change. I tell them I have been hearing lifter noises and a strange whining from the transmission. After an hour in the waiting room they take me out to the garage to show me the underneath of new car covered in some kind of fluid that is leaking from somewhere under the motor. They dont know what kind of fluid it is. So I have to leave my car while they try to figure out what is wrong with it. A week later I get a call saying they think it is oil and it is the rear main seal. They tell me it was probably like that since my last change, at which time I point out that this is the first oil change on my new car so they say it was probably installed wrong at the factory and has been leaking like that since I got it new off the lot. They also tell me they dont know what they sounds are that I was hearing. So I guess I was hearing things! 3 weeks later they finally have the car back together and are going to drive it for 50 miles and make sure that there is no more leak. I opened up a case with Honda Motor Corp. because I have serious doubts about the reliability of this vehicle since it has been like this since the factory how do I know what kind of damage it has suffered internally?

"I've bought many Hondas since 1984, mostly Accords and Odysseys, all with bullet-proof reliability, comfort and handling. I decided to treat myself to a new, 2016 Pilot Touring AWD, now that the kids are grown. This is the most comfortable and quiet Honda I've ever owned. That's all the good I can say. The rest is either fair to poor. Handling on curves is somewhat cumbersome. The 9-speed transmission is slow to react to driver demands. If you approach a car on a curve on a 2-lane road, the car senses and flashes an imminent collision. The hood of the car flutters like a flag on a windy day when at highway speeds. The automatic cruise control is good at slowing down and braking when a car jumps in front of you, but recovery to set speed is very slow. The Infotainment system is too complicated to operate and voice commands are recognized only about 50% of the time. The Garmin navigation is excellent though. Last, but not least, reliability is poor in extreme cold. Getting out of work the evening of 12/18/16, the outside air temperature was -15 degrees. My brand-new Pilot stranded me by refusing to start. The engine didn't turn over at all. The next day I called the dealer, he said it was most likely a bad battery and would be replaced. On 12/20/16, I went to go get my Pilot with jumper cables in hand. It was + 25 degrees outside. I decided to try to start it one more time before using jumper cables, and it started immediately. The battery was later tested at the dealer, and the dealer said the battery was fine, with no other explanation of why my new Pilot didn't start at -15 degrees, while every other one of my coworker’s vehicles started with no issues. So sad, no more Hondas for me.",neg
"This 9 speed transmission is horrible. I have had it in the shop SIX times for factory updates, resets and adjustments. CLONKS and jerks into 5th gear, and slips into 1st and 2nd gear. DO NOT BUY THIS JEEP! Google the Cherokee and see if you like the feedback.",neg
"I have only owned this vehicle for 2months, It rides like a tank, you fell absolutely every defect or bump in the road. It is the most uncomfortable vehicle we have ever owned. The Jeep looks good, dont buy the 4Cyl it has no get up and go! Why bother making it a 4wheel drive. My old Grand Cherokee from 1995 rode better than this. Worst buy every and now I am upside down over 10,000.:( :(",neg
"6 weeks into ownership - stranded by a dead battery. Dealer says bad battery, I say something killed it, and am waiting for it to happen again. Many rattles in the interior, clunking noise from the front end. Overall, very disappointing, especially for paying extra vs other models for Honda reliability. Ugh. I do not recommend, and I will be looking to get rid of this lemon come springtime, if it makes it that long.",neg
"As said in the other reviews, the infotainment system doesn't work and the voice commands are very frustrating and dangerous to use. Honda refuses to update the infotainment system with Android Auto. My 2016 Honda Pilot EX-L with 4WD and Honda Sensing cost $40,000 and does not have a CD player or NAV, and in retrospect it unfortunately is not a good value. I like the six speed transmission, and Honda Sensing has already paid for itself by preventing two accidents. But after yelling at the voice commands for a year my wife wanted me to trade in the Pilot on a Toyota Highlander. The dealer only offered me $30,000 for the Honda, so I guess I'm stuck with it. Woof! It's a dog. Do yourself a favor and buy a Toyota Highlander instead, it has a nicer interior, drives almost as well and has an easy to use infotainment system.",neg
"Actually the dealership has been great, my problem is that Chrysler has not stood behind the product. I purchased the 2012 Grand Cherokee Overland model with the leather interior. The seam stitching split on the dash by the windshield and I took it in and was informed by the manufacturer representative that they would not take care of it. This was about a year and a 1/2 ago and the vehicle had about 29,000 miles on it. This is a one owner vehicle that has always been garaged and cared for the entire time. For the record, until Chrysler steps up and stands behind the product, I will not entertain any Chrysler products, including when I replace my Chrysler Mercedes SL550. It really is a shame! A simple solution and no one has the ability to resolve it.",neg
Worst Honda Ever Made,neg
I bought this SUV new in 2014. It guzzles oil like crazy. The dealership was no help. Subaru was no help. They kept telling me the oil consumption was normal. I finally gave up and just carry oil everywhere in case I need to add some. I got some mail a couple months telling me Subaru settled a class action lawsuit over the excessive oil consumption of my car model. So I guess it wasnt normal after all.,neg
I have been driving this SUV almost one year. I thought it was best car for me. Spent lot of money. but I am disappointed because of AWD system performs in offroad tests as it was one of the worst performers. I've been loyal to Toyota for many years and now I am really disappointed. searing wheel is not comfortable at all for long drive. interior accessories is very low quality. AWD performance is not good enough. side view mirror is not balance with driving seat. most of the time I can not see while I try to turn left or right. If I could I will return this SUV but probably there is no option in this case. Hope it will help people who wants a good quality SUV.,neg
"I test drove the newest Highlander and other crossover SUVs in the segment was not impressed. I went in very excited and considered the Highlander to be a favorite going in but it was very disappointing. The car itself felt cheap compared to others in the segment and wasn't as smooth a ride. The space was underwhelming as well, especially in the 3rd row. I like the front end style of the car but a couple of angles looked kind of minivan-ish. Was also disappointed seeing how poor the Highlander's AWD system performs in offroad tests as it was one of the worst performers on Fast Lane's test up Gold Mine Hill. I've been loyal to Toyota for many years but I think it's time to consider other options.",neg
Check out the Piloteers web site. Car is roomy and has a decent ride. Computer overestimates the MPG for some unknown reason. The touch screen is a joke. Not worth it. The FM reception is horrible and Honda won't fix it. Can not recommend this car.,neg
"I hate my 2015 Jeep Cherokee Sport. I bought it almost two years ago and 36,000 miles later, it is worth much less than half of what I bought it for. Within 6 months it started giving me problems. Oil consumption which ended up in an engine replacement at 11,000 miles, after taking the car to the dealer numerous times for repair. Then started the transmission noises and roughness. Software updates and transmission failure. I have always loved Jeeps and was finally in a position to buy my very own. I will never buy another Jeep again. It looks beautiful but it is definitely not worth it. No consolation is the fact that my 3 yr warranty has expired and I still have 4 years of payments left, and praying nothing else goes wrong with it.",neg
"It was bad enough that my brand new Grand Cherokee was leaking oil as soon as I brought it home (which ended up needing a full axle replacement). Now the transmission is having problems over and over again at only 6,000 miles. Shifting is horrible and out of sync. I don't even like driving it and can't wait to get a different vehicle. I should have stuck with Ford. Had my F-150 for 4 years and not a single problem.",neg
"I have had to replace the plastic skid plate, broke the first time I was off road, the seat belt,the power window, the gas cover and now the transmission. Only the transmission covered by the warranty. The tires are weak and constantly flat so I had to buy smaller wheels and 10 ply tires. the car has the worst navigation system ever. I will never buy another jeep.",neg
"I hate to admit it, my husband may have been right on this one. When we test drove my Pilot before I bought it, my husband did not think it handled very well and I fell in love with the interior space and all the technology. My husband wanted me to shop around a bit more before deciding, but I knew I was sure this was it. Now after driving it almost 2 months, I hate to admit it, he was right. It does not handle well, The steering is all over the place and I have trouble keeping the vehicle going straight. There is a bottom heavy feeling, but the feel of the road is not there and a delay from when you turn the steering wheel to when the wheels start to turn. I have to take corners very slow as I am not sure when the wheels will start to turn. I took it back to the dealer to see if anything was wrong or needed to be adjusted and was told it is the way the car was designed. They also told me I was not the first person to complain about the steering and they had already notified Honda about the issue. I know I am going to never hear the end of this from my husband, but I just am not comfortable driving such a poor handling vehicle and want to get rid of it. I am currently talking with the dealer on trading it on something better. Please don't make the same mistake I did.",neg
"If you want a Jeep with recalls and electrical problems, then this Jeep is for you! It also has the air conditioner issues of it's predecessors, where one side gives you heat and the other air. Plan on spending more time in the shop with this unreliable good looking Jeep with the added fear of taking it on long trips. Google and YouTube all the complaints on this problem child before squandering good money.",neg
"I have had this car for less then 6 months and it's been in the shop 3 times. I just stops in the middle of the road mid-drive. 3 times I've been driving on very busy roads, I expected more from Jeep.",neg
"My boyfriend and I purchased this vehicle used about a year ago and we are now looking to trade it in. The transmission is just horrible. Every single time I accelerate after coming to a stop, the car pops forward. The car shifts extremely rough. We've spoken to the dealership and according to them, this is a common issue with this vehicle and there's nothing they can do to fix the transmission problem. Once those initial hard shifts are done popping me forward, the car rides very smooth but it accelerates horribly. It does very well in snow and rain which is nice. The gas mileage is awful as well though. I prefer driving my little 2010 Kia soul over this car which is horrible since the Jeep is supposedly a fancy car.",neg
"I went to test drive the 2016 Pilot and was not overly impressed with the styling, It’s very generic and blends in with everything else. Honda spent a lot of energy designing the interior and the quality of the materials is very good. It has a good use of space and a decent amount of usb and power outlets. I did not like the fact the rear glass does not open separately and a power lift is the only option. I frequently carry longer items and stick them out through the back window. I would also prefer to have a center console / arm rest instead of the flip down arms rest that remind me of a minivan. What really soured me on this new design is the way it drove. The steering has a very unusual feel that I did not like at all. Also the engine start / stop thing needs to go. It is just annoying and I don’t see a benefit, other than more wear and tear on the starter. It is clear Honda was more interested in how many cup holder are in the vehicle, rather than how it drove.",neg
"After letting go of my reliable 2006 Honda CR-V, I thought I made a good choice with a 2017 Subaru Forester. Well, I am sitting home stranded over the weekend with NO car, while my new car sits in the service lot. Won't get to my car until mid week. First and last Subaru.",neg
I just bought this vehicle and have driven a rental car more than I have driven this. I was on day 29 and the transmission would not get out of second gear. Got it fixed but 1 week later it did it again. Worst vehicle EVER!!!!,neg
"I had wonderful intentions when I purchased this Jeep. I was told of how great a car it was, etc etc. So I spent 70K on it. BIG HUGE MISTAKE! The car has a mind of its own. No one can find what is wrong. DO NOT SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS VEHICLE! All it has going for it, its the engine power. Nothing else!",neg
"The interior noise levels in this CRV is unacceptably high, the pitch is aggrevating likes to get up to 81 DCB and is at least 4 DCBs higher than my old tired GMC envoy. Honda engineering doesnt care about customer satisfaction..their take is it isnt much worse than most of their cars. Looks like a paint adhesion issue has already started, and the single intermittent speed wipers are the epitomy of cheap. Honda preaches customer satisfaction, but they really dont care!",neg
Leg and Knee hits door panel causing cramping and pain on mid to long trips and is very uncomfortable! Poor gas milage in winter,neg
"This is my 4th 4 x 4 vehicle. I bought this planning to keep for 6 years. In less than 1 year Transmission already broke 3 times and there is always something wrong; ABS, engine light As bad has the car is the service. But it makes sense, every-time I go to the dealer, someone is complaining about their Jeep and takes more than One week to make an appointment . Jeep... Never again.",neg
An obvious defect in the leather dash caused it to bubble up and separate. dealer would not help. I am left with an expensive mess. very disapointed,neg
"I will never buy a jeep, or chrysler product ever again. I just went to replace the 2nd burnt out head light and the dealership said $612.01 to have it replaced. I had more recalls I can imagine. The back hatch barely works, had it in numerous times for hesitating, had to replace the tires after 30k miles, GPS works when it wants to, plus other issues.",neg
The car was about three months old when the transmission was replaced and within six months it was back at dealership for same problems. All the same problems still exist one week later so it is back to the dealership. The car has less than 3 thousand miles on it.,neg
"The 2014 Forester was highly rated by all the experts and had a good lease program so I got one. What a disappointment. It does have a lot of room, is reasonably comfortable, and gets 25 mpg but..............I had to replace the tires after 2 months because the car was all over the road if the pavement was even wet. Something about the drive system wears the tires badly too. I had to have a brake job at 21000 miles. The battery is a total wimp, and I have had to be jump started 6-8 times since last summer and now carry jumper cables full time. The heat and AC are both marginal at best, slow to come on and not very warm or cold. Be wary of Subaru parts, I broke a tail light and the replacement cost me $280. New interior air filters cost me $60. When it is time for an oil change you have to use expensive synthetic oil. If I was not stuck with the lease until Oct 2016, I would be rid of this car immediately.",neg
"I purchased this car in Feb 2014 for future long trips (included cold weather package 4 w/d and navigation packages). Before end of first year it was towed for transmission problem, would not go into reverse. Had a recall for transmission fix shortly thereafter. Next tow was one and one/half years later, same problem; third tow, two months after that (last month), same problem would not go into gear (300 miles from home and took four days to repair). Said it was fixed with the newest recall module and an additional problem with the valve body part dealership found. Guess I am lucky it did roll over me when I got out to see if I had run over anything the noise was so bad. What's a person to do?",neg
"I love the options, comfort, handling and gas mileage. I hate how many times it has been in the shop. It was recalled 6 times and had 3 warranty issues. Each repair requires two visits since one visit is to verify if your vehicle is indeed one that needs to be repaired and the second is because they need to order the part for the recall or warranty repair. Unbelievable. It is in the shop more than a 10 year old jalopy. : (",neg
I bought this car brand new and had to bring it back to the dealer with 1300 miles on it for transmission trouble. Over the course of the next 4 months 2 additional transmissions were put in before I reached 4k miles. I filed a lemon law suit 11 months ago and FCA is fighting with the attorneys and refusing to buy it back without making me pay for the miles driven on the car. It wouldn't have miles on it if they had taken it back when I filed the suit. I am being told not to drive it because I WILL OWE CHRYSLER MONEY if they decide to take the car back. This is the only car in my household! It is now worth $10k less than I owe due to carfax report - TERRIBLE - DO NOT BUY!!,neg
"I could not wait to purchase my first Jeep and get on the road. Got the 4x4 so bad weather could not stop me. I had no idea that the computer generated ""SERVICE TRANSMISSION"" message would cause four breakdowns (have 25,300 miles). I had it towed to a dealership to do whatever they do, wait a few days for that to happen, then it would be fine until the next time. Well, today I am stuck 300 miles from home. Had it towed again today. So disappointed in my Jeep. I thought it would be really reliable for a woman to travel alone across the US. I need to trade it in when I get back home. I have had enough.",neg
Please do not buy a Jeep Cherokee. I have 800 miles and I feel it is unsafe to drive. Save yourself and look for another car. Check the Jeep Cherokee forums for proof.,neg
"Pros: roomy interior, good visibility, good brakes, adequate hwy acceleration, fuel economy meets epa estimates. CVT transmission works smoothly and quietly so far. Cons: Found out about the ongoing oil consumption problem when the salesman warned us after buying the car. With this information I was then able to specifically search for Subaru oil consumption issues...lots of people having problems. For some owners the oil consumption did not start until 20k-almost 40k miles. Not good. I'm watching the oil level closely. If a problem starts then this Forster will be down the road..deforested. The heater system is the coldest of any car we have ever owned. in summary my wife says it is a cold car, whereas her Toyota Highlander will cook you out of the car in a few miles. The dealership checked the heat system and said it is ok, but the temp and volume of airflow is truly lacking, thus takes a long engine warm up on cold days 10 degF or colder. Therefore so much for the partial zero emissions. The heater controls are very difficult to read, chrome knobs with a small square marker to identify what the setting is. The seats are stiff and take getting used to. The car has 70 series (wide) tires and skids easily on hardpack or icy roads. The Forester also gets stuck easily...6 inches of wind-drift in the driveway and have to resort to moving back and forth...whereas the Highlander (2002) works thru it with ease. Moving the Forster forward thru deeper snow, but not up to the belly of the car, the car starts to hop and shudder..the car barely keeps moving. The Highlander goes thru the same untracked snow with no problem. The car has a large windshield, no across the top window tint, and small sun visors that dont reach to the rear view mirror nor do they step up and over the mirror...thus on winter days with the sun at a low angle to the horizon, it shines in between the mirror and sun visor...no way to block it. When driving 800 miles to visit family at Christmas that became alot of sun in your eyes for hours on end. In summary, back in the 1960's the motto was owning a vehicle required putting up with a certain amount of hassle...I did not expect this with a 2016 vehicle. The on-going oil consumption problem, the poor heater, the poor winter traction all combine to reach a poor review.",neg
"I bought this vehicle with 200 miles. Thus far the only failure has been the radio (control display). I have not had any mechanical issues at all. I would have been very satisfied with this vehicle if it wasn't the poorly designed transmission. It is clumpsy with very slow response during gear transition, particularly while down-shift. This makes the quite efficient 2.4L engine a mismatch. I have read of reliability issues, particularly with the transmission, and thus far that's not the case for me.",neg
"I have been locked out of this vehicle more than 5 times in 3 months. The keyless entry system does not recognize the FOB, during these times. Chrysler says since it cannot be duplicated at the dealership, my complaint has been closed. The dealer has been understanding, and done what Chrysler has recommended. It has been concluded that it is caused by radio interference, when I park in certain places. Now I have instructions to open the door with the key and use the FOB to depress the start button.",neg
"I have had this car back to the shop 6 +times since buying it. i have had 1 new transmission, had steering fluid leaks, starting problems and on going shifting issues. I loved the look and capability of this american classic, but with these problems I cant say i would recommend the car to anyone.",neg
"I wish I would have waited until this vehicle had been around for a year or two before purchasing. Buying it brand new without any reviews was a terrible mistake. I've had nothing but problems between replacing the starter, horrible engine leaks and transmission problems. It's been in the dealership twice already for software updates and I'm still having transmission issues. I would love to get rid of it but of course now the Cherokees are not worth what you paid and you end up being upside down on any deal.",neg

At 215 miles, trans went into limp mode and needed software update, 387 miles, trans cooler leaked and was replaced, 1500 miles recall on seat belts. 13000 miles, check engine light on.....transmission needed to be replaced. On that day we traded it in on a different vehicle. We knew we were not going to keep the car after the warranty ran out, so while we still had equity, we decided to pull the plug and get rid of it! The service advisor told us they have had to replace many of the 9 speed transmissions. I pity the poor guy they sell ours too.",neg

"2 weeks after owning the vehicle computer issues. returned the vehicle 4-5 times for jerking upon acceleration and each time it was computer update required and I was sent on my way. On the 4 or 5th time I pulled out to the dealership (mind you all repairs had been completed) and the check engine light came on the car jerked so hard as if every part from under the hood was going to fall out. Dealership ended up replacing the transmission and computer (mind you at this point I haven't had the vehicle 6 months). Less than 30 days after transmission was replaced I am in a rental car same issues with the car! Very annoyed, inconvenienced and overly disappointed.",neg
"The car used oil from the beginning and ended up with a new engine at about 11,000 miles which leaked oil. It took 3 or 4 trips to the dealer to get the leaks fixed which took pulling the new engine as well as many other leaks. It drives well when it is not in the shop though.",neg
"Everything about this Jeep Cherokee Latitude 6cyl has attitude! However, since I'd read other reviews with the same issue, I decided it only fair to confirm that at only 5000 miles, 5 months approx. it's in the dealership getting a whole new drive train. That's the negative news. TYPICALLY, however, as in my new 1990 Pontiac Sunbird, once the drive train was replaced under warranty, it became the best vehicle I'd ever owned. So it's very likely that this vehicle will have a better drive train than the factory issue. However, since I'm so under the warranty, should I have further issues, I'd re-post.",neg
"I really wanted a Forester, so I went with the 2014 model but honestly it's been nothing but a disappointment,first Subie was a 2006 Outback and loved it, lasted 250,000 miles when I decided to upgrade,Big Mistake! I had to have the transmission replaced on the Forester at 60,000 miles, I keep having to add oil at least 2-3 times before it's next oil change. The dealer states it should last 6-7500 miles, but its not uncommon to add oil in between oil changes, now the dealer states that the cam carrier is leaking from the left side and needs resealing at a $1600 price, I do a lot of highway miles back and forth to work and unfortunately work pretty far from home so I do put on some pretty hefty miles but I don't know how much more I can take before I dump this car.",neg
I purchased a 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee Overland Eco-Diesel about a year ago and have been in and out of the shop once a moth over this last year getting the CEL reset and parts replaced and DEF fluids drained and refilled half way.

"I have had this car for 2 years. It has been in for warranty service on the ball joint (1 week after purchase), transmission slipping (2 months after purchase), transmission slipping/banging 7 (months after purchase), recall for airbag issues (1 year after purchase), strut issue (1.5 years after purchase, transmission slipping/banging (1.5 years after service). How's that for American quality? The transmission issue is always a ""software update"" or they couldn't replicate it in the parking lot so it must not be a problem. The 9 speed transmission that is supposed to be a plus is actually a detriment to its performance, when it's actually functioning correctly. I have no doubt the Jeep Grand Cherokee or Wrangler are still great vehicles (out of my price range). The '14 Cherokee is not a ""real"" Jeep at all. They did the Cherokee name a bad service by slapping it on this sub par, soft vehicle. If I could give no stars on quality and reliability, I would.",neg
"Transmission,transmission,transmission had to replace all computer models and transmission @4000 miles.Electronics continually going hay wire.I won't drive it but to work and back. I have a 2005 Saturn w/120,000 miles that I have more confidence in getting me where i need to go.",neg

"Very nice aesthetically, but lots of recalls and quality issues. The vehicle looks nice inside and out, I like the touch screen and interior. But, after many recalls, a leaky shock, tire replacements, rubber flap in back wheel well constantly comes off, squeaky break pedal, sluggish acceleration at random times, and a constant problem with the vehicle realizing it's in park. Have to move the shifter around for it to work so I can shut the vehicle off. Trading it in for a Ford Edge.",neg
"just received the sixth recall for this vehicle. Have owned it for one year. It is currently at the dealer for the second time due to transmission problems. Also, they are replacing the radiator because it developed a leak. I really love the appearance of this vehicle and the comfort. But I am beginning to think that i have a lemon on my hands. Perspective buyer need to research the problems associated with this vehicle before you purchase.",neg
"Purchased December 2014. The front end, in my opinion is ugly, but the vehicle was so comfortable to sit in and came with a very nice interior (TrailHawk with GPS, Leather etc for a good price) Unfortunately my first transmission completely failed at just around 5K miles, with very little warning. Around 6k miles I was feeling the second transmission continuing to have periodic problems with jumping or slamming into the low gears when slowing down or stopping. Also hesitating to take off occasionally. The local dealer and the corporate customer service has been absolutely horrible and unable to assist. Also tried sport mode and it's not good. All I can see is that it causes the vehicle to run at excessively high RPMs before shifting and at low gears will not upshift normally causing the transmission to strain and heat up significantly. Overall, the exterior is nice but I dislike the front end shape. The interior and technology is great, but due to the ongoing transmission issues (which I've learned is common) these Jeeps are unreliable and the company unwilling to do anything.",neg
Don't buy one.....,neg
"Pros: Incredible interior which is laid out well. The Uconnect radio is great. Cons: Horrible transmission. The cars shifts poorly at best under 35 mph and lunges through gear shifts. This is intermittent behavior and you never know when it is going to happen. Over 40 mph, it acts like a normal transmission. I have had it in for service 5 times including once with the regional service person. They say that these are the ""characteristics"" of this transmission. I have repeatedly asked if these characteristics would be acceptable in another transmission. It has had 3 ""software updates"" for the transmission already. Filed the ""lemon law notice"". Regional guy stated that this car has a 96% satisfaction rate. You really don't want to be the 4% then.",neg
"I'll start with the good: Once it actually starts delivering power the 3.2 V6 has adequate power and returns good fuel mileage. The ride is quiet and I guess as close to serene as can be expected on-road. The 120v power outlet is nice. Now the bad: Throttle response is all over the place. It's impossible to drive this car smoothly because the throttle's behavior changes all the time based on whatever software decides, so you can't drive this car smoothly or with finesse. A quarter inch of foot movement might mean gentle acceleration one moment but then the same quarter inch of foot movement might mean vigorous acceleration another time because the car's software decided to react differently. That would almost be tolerable, except the 9 speed transmission is a joke. For one thing 9th gear isn't even possible below 80mph. But more crucially, the transmission doesn't shift like normal automatics, there are a couple shifts where you have absolutely no power for two or more seconds while it makes up its mind on what it's going to do. This is infuriating and unsafe. Even if I loved the rest of this vehicle, I would loathe it for the transmission. The car has a ton of ""Features"" but they're imbecilic, like a huge glass roof (the whole roof) with a roof rack above it? What's the point of that I can't put cargo on the glass and if I put a basket over the glass I can't see out so what is the point of the glass? It's stupid. I can start the car from the internet 1000 miles away... but what good does that do? That's ridiculous. I would rather if the car just had a transmission that didn't make me want to kill myself.",neg
"Always start with something nice, right? The interior is lovely. And the panoramic roof is so cool. There. Now, the 9 speed auto transmission is a nightmare. Imagine driving a manual transmission with a first time driver... Yup, that bad. I've been on the phone with techs from the dealership to Detroit, and the answer is the same, ""There's nothing wrong with YOUR Jeep, it just drives like that."" And, why would anyone who's ever driven put the emergency break next to the cup holder? Good fun.",neg
"Without going into much detail (because it would consumer several pages), I have been in the dealership for repairs over 30 times in 15 months, which includes several recalls. Some of the issues include: Steering wheel falls apart (replaced by a cracked steering wheel which Jeep refuses to address), faulty key fob sensors which do not allow me to open the rear lift gate and falsely signal that the key fob has left the vehicle -Drooping exhaust pipes, navigation not recognizing common destinations, voice recognition software is basically useless, touch display will not respond to touches many times, speedometer goes blank so I don't know how fast I'm going, rear lift gate handle was falling off and entire lift gate was misaligned, causing water to leak inside, awful gas mileage compared to the competition, an old-style floor based parking brake (Mercedes and others are using electronic switches to activate parking brake), vehicle unlocks itself (have had items stolen from my car because of this), complete incompetence of Jeep to handle this properly (lots of denials, refusals for service, etc.), many more issues... At $53,000 please go buy something else. I will be so very happy if others can learn from my experience and buy something that is worth that amount of money. Looks like I will be reverting back to Infiniti.",neg
"Purchased car in the fall 2014, one issue of major concern is the 9 speed automatic transmission. Jeep updated the software, with little notice or improvement. Very erratic shifting and delays in moving from park to drive or between drive and reverse. Horrible climbing up steep hills of 45-60 degrees, car slows down and crawls up the hill unless you push the accelerator to the floor, and then it down shifts and speeds up with a strong jerk. Totally dissatisfied with the transmission, dealer says they've done all they can and don't feel there is a problem. After 4 Jeeps in the last 20 years this will be the last Jeep purchase I make.",neg
"I have 3500 miles on my new 2015 Trail Hawk. The check engine light came on. Have only been able to drive the car 3 days in the last month and a half because it's been in the for service.

"Gosh I had high hopes for this lease vehicle. It has several nice interior design touches and the exterior has eye pleasing lines with an aggressive front end. BUT...as an earlier reviewer stated...TRANSMISSION, TRANSMISSION, TRANSMISSION. I already need a transmission!?! KBB gave the vehicle high marks based on the German designed 9 speed tranny...too bad it don't work! Can't recommend the model at this point.",neg
"There ought to be a class action suit against Chrysler for putting a transmission on the market not fully de-bugged. Jeep service people say the tranny has to ""learn"" how you drive to settle down; it's had 6500 miles to do that and it's still as ""clunky"", ""jerky"" and uncomfortable and scary to drive as ever. Scary because of the lack of any smoothness between gears and the fear that the drive train will break as soon as the warranty expires. This is one of the worst car investments I've made and just don't have the time or inclination to file the lemon law process. Fortunately, this is a company lease which is unfortunate as I've exposed my company to costs down the road that reflect on me. Lousy car experience and Chrysler employees have been less than helpful. At one point they offered to buy back the car then had a change of heart when they claimed the transmission, bad as it was, was not categorized as a manufacturer's defect. If it isn't defective what is it??",neg
"Buyer beware, this car has transmission issues. (look up 2015 jeep Cherokee transmission issues) I couldn't understand why my brand new automatic car was hesitating, shifting between gears slowly and running sluggish until it died on the side of the road, miles from home! Come to find out there is a software update issue. I waited 3 hours for Chrysler Road Side Assistance to come ( an hour a half later than they said) and was just told I may need a new transmission. Really?? Who cares if the car is under warranty. A brand new car with only 5000 miles should not break down.I am leasing this car and do not plan on ever leasing a jeep again. Unfortunately I have 2 and half years to go.",neg
"I loved this car for the combination of compact size, mileage, 4 WD and towing capacity. I researched it before buying and all seemed great. I like the way it drives and handles...when it works. I have had repeat transmission issues on the care since I bought it 7 months ago. It has been in 4 times and while the service department is easy to work with, the transmission continues to have the same problem where it drops out of gear and sometimes even stops while driving. I was patient with the recommended resolution but after 4 visits and still the same issue it is not safe to drive. They have said that it may need the transmission replaced but will only allow incremental repairs to rule out less expensive fixes before doing so. I cannot take the risk of having it stop and getting into an accident. Cutting my losses at this point.",neg
"I have owned my GC Summit for 18 months and 30,000 miles. Its a great car for the money however I have had nothing but trouble with this car. To their credit Jeep has solved every issue under warranty but the inconvenience of dropping the car off for a few days every other month is not a pleasant experience, the car has had issues with the A/C, Cruise Control, Seatbelt alarm, Break boosters, suspension airlifts, blue smoke, body panels coming off and rust on the front pumper. The materials used in this car look nice but feel very cheap to the touch! Just touch the front grille!",neg
"Expected more from a Jeep. Nice looking, but completely unreliable. Been stuck twice on the highway with the ""service transmission"" indicator coming on. I was lucky to be able to get to the highway shoulder, on the second instance (with tractor trailers flying by). No gear changes. FW upgrade did not fix the problem. First time at 1000mi. Barely 2 months old right now. With similar postings on the web, this is clearly not just one lemon!",neg
"We were looking to add another vehicle our choices were narrowed to Acura ILX, Jeep Cherokee and RAV 4. we asked if we could test drive the Cherokee. little nice looking crossover with good MPG. nice and smooth ride on city. I asked if I could go on a freeway and the young salesman said yes. he was very cooporative btw, starting from the first gear getting entering freeway the check engine light ""transmission service"" light warning popped up. we decided to exit from freeway and take the street back. 1st gear was busted and the little cute corssover would start from the 2nd gear. we were upset but our salesman was mad and upset from JEEP. Do they inspect the car before putting into lot to sale?",neg
"I have owned nothing but Jeep Grand Cherokees for the past 20 years, having had at least 5 in that time. The new transmission and gear shifter, introduced for the 2014 model is just awful. Transmission is sluggish and slow to respond. Feels sometimes like when you are driving with someone in a manual transmission car and they dont know how to shift. The new gear shifter is complicated, and its hard to know what gear you are in, or get the car into the gear you want. I have thought I was in park and actually was in reverse. I cant bee live they ruined this car. The transmission was awesome, the gear shifter was fine, and they just ruined them. I will be selling my new 2014 with 3500 miles on it as soon as I can. I have noted many used 2014's available on dealer websites, so obviously I am not alone. This vehicle is a dud.",neg
"I have owned this car for a little over a year, and have been battling Chrysler to fix the transmission from the beginning. I've had the vehicle in 9 or 10 times (for more than 30 days off the road), but only after I hired a lawyer did they finally replace the transmission. They don't value their customers at all and don't support their products - it's no wonder they have the lowest % of repeat buyers among the large manufacturers. The car looks great and has some nice features, but don't be sucked into what I'll call the superficial qualities of the car. The car consistently shifted like a teenager learning to drive a stick (and this car is an automatic). Chrysler wouldn't allow the dealership to put in new parts, but instead kept trying a series of software updates, never caring if it actually fixed my problem. They didn't care that I was inconvenienced by having to continually bring it back in for repair, and didn't care if that the car didn't work properly. If you buy this car after reading this review, you only have yourself to blame.",neg
"Love the whole Cherokee looks nice, great mileage, handles well, and then there is the transmission I have had it for 10 months and have taken it back 4 times, it stayed over 3 times. I have been told the jerking is normal as the transmission is looking to give me the best mileage, also that the transmission is designed this way and nothing is wrong. The last visit 2 weeks ago they unloaded all of the software then reloaded it and made some enhancements to the transmission, it was great for 1and 1/2 days then back to what it has been doing all along.",neg
"At 10000 miles I started having trouble with the transmission and took it to the dealership where they had to reset some items for recall and to make it not stall, jerk and loose power. Now with 14500 miles on it I have the same situation. 5 times in the last week I got stuck in traffic and was put in harms way. It may have been a good idea at the time but I am tired of feeling that I will not make it to where I am going.....",neg
Don't buy this car if customer service on warranty items is important to you. I've made countless calls for a warranty issue and am constantly told by Chrysler they have no information and then the dealer tells me the info has been sent. Bottom line I have not recieved a call back more than a dozed times after I was promised a return call and resolution. Don't buy a Chrysler!,neg
"I purchased this car brand new. Within the first two days the transmission started jerking really hard between gears 1-3. On day 6 the exterior door handle just fell off. On day 10 the transmission got worse and jerked incessantly. It has been in service for 8 days out of the first two weeks I have had the vehicle. When discussing with Chrysler corporation I was told ""It was completely normal and I didn't know how to drive it."" They also informed me they would not be fixing anything because nothing is wrong, however my car is still in the shop to ""not fix anything."" Will NEVER buy anything Chrysler again nor would I recommend any Chrysler product after their ""customer Service"" and ""normal transmission.""",neg
The worst transmission ever built on the planet!,neg
"Day after buying my Jeep Cherokee Latitude, I was driving to work and I get low oil pressure warning and car loses all pickup. Bring it to dealership the next day to find out that the connection that hold the oil filter on was cracked and spewing oil. After they fix that I notice the transmission slips on stop and go and when going from reverse into drive. Bring it back to dealership (2nd visit in less than a week of owning the Jeep). They assure me that the oil issue and the transmission are not connected. After keeping the car all day they tell me the computer isn’t giving them any errors to which I respond by telling them to drive it and tell me that there’s nothing wrong with it…. I get a call back the next day saying that they would do a transmission adjustment which takes a while and may not make a difference. When I pick it up I’m told, “The transmission has to learn your driving habits so that it can adjust to you and it will get better over time”. After diving a short distance I notice a slight difference but the issues were still there. Now I’ve got about 5500 miles on it and I notice a rattle under the car when it starts and a high pitched noise when sitting idle. The transmission is worse than ever. Backing out of my driveway is a daily adventure wondering if it’s going to engage smooth or slip and bang into gear jerking the car forward. When going up minor hills it will drop from fourth or fifth gear to first or second gear and send the RMP’s between 4k – 5k and making it sound like I’m trying to Evil Knievel the hill. If you do some research you’ll see that this is a common problem (transmission). I’ve going to be bringing it back to the dealership asking for some serious answers. I’d recommend that anyone interested in this vehicle wait another year or two until they figure the transmission out. Right now we’re the guinea pigs paying hard earned money to do their testing for them….",neg
"I bought my Cherokee Limited (4X4 V6) in Jan 2014. I have to admit that I was distracted by all the ""shiny"" extras. Had I done some research I may have thought twice about buying it. If it weren't for the transmission this would be the best vehicle I've ever owned. BUT...the transmission has been a problem since not long after I bought it. It's been in the shop several times. The first two times they did updates to the transmission and it seemed to help some for a little while but the sluggishness and hesitation always came back. I took it back in June and let them have it overnight so one of the mechanics could drive it home (about 100 mile round trip). After that I was told it was ""running the way it was designed to run"". So, I sucked it up and learned to deal with it. Through the summer it seemed to be running a little better but as soon as the weather turned it started hesitating badly and the shifting was rougher than it had been. Then I started hearing a strange noise when I got to around 30-40 mph. I called the shop the next morning and was told to bring it in. Turns out something broke and all of my transmission fluid was draining and they are going to have to replace the entire transmission. I'm hoping this will solve all of the problems I've had from the start but I'm afraid it's just going to be like starting from square one. I've only read one review that talks about performance after the new transmission and it was a good review. Hopefully I have the same experience. I have several friends who own Jeeps, although none who own the Cherokee, and love them. I wish I knew how that felt.",neg
"I'm so disappointed with my purchase. Now that I'm reading similar reviews, I see many others have had similar problems. I purchased a 2014 4x4 Cherokee Limited exactly 2 weeks ago. I drove it for two days, less than 200 miles, when the all wheel drive system began trying to engage and locking the wheels up every time I would take off from a stop. It has now been in the dealership's garage for 10 days and they tell me they're not sure what the issue is. The have ordered parts (taking another stab in the dark at how to fix it) which I was told will take an additional 2 weeks to even be delivered to the dealership! Meanwhile, I will have a car payment due at that time for a vehicle I haven't even ran 1/2 tank of gas through yet! My hope is the garage has it for more than 30 days and I can utilize the Lemon Law in my state. Do your research people! I should have known better and chose something different instead of buying this on an impulse. :(",neg
"Overall I have to say I had better things to do with my life than nurse this poorly engineered car through the next 5 or more years. Check engine, suspect transmission, groans and creaks, recalls...don't waste your time and then get burned with horrible resale. Got a 4 Runner no rattles, issues or drama... put it in garage and can worry about more important things.",neg
"This is the worst car I have ever had. Coming from my 2006 VW Touareg V8 I feel like I have taken a major step backwards. The car handles like an old Buick and has absolutely no steering response. You feel nothing. The 3.6L Pentastar is noisy and slow. The transmission rushes to eighth gear and G-D forbid you have to merge onto a highway, you need to floor the rattle trap in order to get it to jump down to a passing gear. I can not wait for this car to go back on lease. To add to it the car does not feel safe and is poorly put together. The headliner is sagging with only 600 miles on it and I can already hear creaks. Wish I kept my VW. The Touareg was a real go anywhere SUV, the Jeep is a go-kart in comparison",neg
I am 1/2 way down on my first tank of gas and transmission has to be replaced.... need to say more?,neg
"Purchased a 2014 Jeep Cherokee Latitude V6 in May. Transmission began shifting poorly on drive home from dealership. Worsened over next several days and returned to service department with 180 miles. Service reprogrammed transmission with slight improvement. Transmission still shutters in lower gears, headlights fog up after carwash, transmission sometimes makes noise after turning off engine and exiting vehicle. Having intermittent failure of radio and camera.",neg
"I purchased this vehicle in January of 2014 and loved it. I drove it as a commuter and around town. After 4 months I noticed the leather seats are not very durable. Average use caused the leather to crease badly, nearly cracking. I've owned several cars with leather and this was the least durable. I have to apply extra leather treatment products to prevent the leather from wearing further. After only 8,000 I also went to get the transmission reflashed. Jeep released an update in May for the transmission. I was hoping it would cure the hard shift from 2nd to 3rd gear. The day after I brought it in and was told there was no update for my vehicle (the service department did not have the most recent updates) my transmission failed. I own the Trailhawk and like the ride. It's very smooth, cruises at a low RPM with little road noise. The interface is great. However, visibility is very bad, the front pillars block a lot of the view while turning. Also, the transmission shifted hard between certain gears then went out after only 8,000 miles. I also hardly got the 25 mpg highway rating for the V6 engine. In addition each Jeep dealership I've dealt with have not been helpful. I would not recommend buying a Cherokee or a Jeep in general.",neg
"No reviews mention the Sport, it is horrible! The engine has no power, you almost have to push the accelerator all the way down for passing. The transmission is NOT smooth when it shifts gears; I truly get sea sick in my car. I am currently looking to trade it in.",neg
"I have owned this vehicle for just less than a year. In that time it has had a new rear differential installed, had to have brake work done, most recent was a new oil pressure sending unit and now a safety recall on the brakes. It drives great and is comfortable but the trips to the shop are getting annoying.",neg
"Transmission shudders at speed over 40 mph under mild acceleration. After two fixes involving software, the problem has not been solved.",neg
Worst quality car ever. 8000 miles and so far we had to deal with: Random error messages on the screen Nav that thinks it is 100 yards from the current location most of the time Flickering backup camera Doors that the don't close unless the last one is slammed shut or a window is down Cruise control that turns off by itself Sticking buttons Voice control that cannot recognize anything,neg
Well I am getting rid of this and selling back to dealer. The interior is just cheap. The leather is of poor quality and the dash is painted cheaply. From a mechanical standpoint the truck handle great but the interior is terrible and Chrysler does not warranty their own design flaws.,neg
This car has electrical problems that Chrysler has tried to fix during the last 7 months.,neg
"We purchased the Cherokee limited with the Active Drive II transmission to pull behind a RV. This was the trans we were told could be flat towed. We were not told that it came with an off road suspension which produces an incredibly rough ride on all but the smoothest asphalt. Speaking to Chrysler was a wast of time since they blamed us for not test driving the car. They don't seem to think they owe anyone the courtesy of telling them up front it's off road. A Luxury $40,000 SUV with ""Off Road Suspension"" begs the question what were they thinking or not thinking.",neg
"We have loved the look of this Jeep for quite some time and heard some negative things about Jeep not being very reliable but we thought since it's 2011 they must have fixed the problems. Well we've had this SUV for 2 years now and have had it in the dealership to many times to count! Major issues that are not covered on the extended warranty of course! I don't think we will ever buy Jeep again. In fact we might just sell this one as much as we love the look of it, the maintenance has been a nightmare!",neg
"If I could afford a $10,000 loss, I would just get rid of this car. My computer went out after 3 months. The drivers seat moved and had a knock noise when turning left, the track was replaced. Took several trips in to get fixed. My dash has this rattle. It is so irritating, I turn my music up not to hear it. I still have trouble when turning on the steering wheel heat, it's a hit and miss. When it and the seat warmer goes on, there is a significant click. I am working now with a consultant from the manufacturer. Hopefully we can come to a resolution. I am miserable.",neg
"This was my first Jeep and at first I was really impressed with it. It is a very solid vehicle with great styling and trim, excellent turning radius, impressive power and it's quiet. I really liked the 30GB hard drive, too bad they had to put 4 of them in it before we could get one to work right. The BlueTooth is a feature I can't live without, but I learned how for the first year I had this thing. They finally got that fixed, but... Over the 2 1/2 years I've owned this, it's been in the shop for transmission issues 4 times, computer issues 4 times, driveability issues another couple of times and if there was ever a vehicle that should have been taken back under the lemon law provisions, this was it. The real kicker was a buildup of water under the passenger's side floorboards which would slosh around constantly while you were driving...it took a year to find and fix that problem. I've had it. I know people swear by these cars, but I can only swear at it. Once I get rid of this, I'llneve buy another Jeep again.",neg
"In February of 2011 I bought a V6 Overland and from day one there were issues. When coasting to a stop the brakes make a horrible humming noise. Jeeps answer: ""its just a minor program problem with no update."" Next was a complete failure of the A/C unit @ 9400 miles. Then at 12,000 miles the tailgate window hinge broke away from the glass because the adhesive melted from the sun. Next was the transmission banging into gear, that was another program problem. There are many other things that failed and I'm sure you can get the picture. I'm not one to buy extended warranties but in this case I ""thought"" it would be wise. The final straw was last week when my whole entire leather dash shrunk and wrinkled literally within 4 days when I left it in my driveway. That problem cost $3800 and of course its not warrantied. This vehicle has been in the shop a total of 24 times in the 33 months I've owned it. Unfortunately at month 24 it was one problem shy of falling under the Florida State Lemon law. I currently still have the jeep but in the process of selling it and never returning to Jeep. At this point its cheaper to cut my losses and go with a better quality manufacturer.",neg
"...and it may sound petty, but I just can't due to all of the issues I've had with UConnect. I have an iPhone 4s and have NEVER, since purchasing the vehicle brand new in Jan. '13, been able to have a reliable connection with my Bluetooth. Yes, that is a VERY minor issue, but if I didn't want those features in a vehicle, I could have spent far less money on something more basic. However, having those features (i.e.: back-up camera, navigation, bluetooth connectivity, etc.) were something I wanted. Almost every time I connect my phone via Bluetooth, one of two things occurs: 1) it takes almost 10 minutes for the connection to work successfully or, more fun 2) the entire screen and all associated controls, freeze. I live approximately 40 minutes from my place of employment and since purchasing my Grand Cherokee, I have driven that 40 minute commute with the back-up camera still active almost 5 times. Unacceptable. When these little ""freezes"" occur, you can't do anything associated with the Nav screen; no navigation, you can't change the radio station, you can't change the volume, nothing. It won't even turn off! Often, the screen will stay on even after the vehicle is in park and I've exited and locked it. At this point I'm not sure what's worse, the fact that I own what could, in theory, be a great car, but it just doesn't live up to the hype, or the poor customer service response I've received from Jeep. Basically they tell me that I have to either live with the computer constantly freezing or just not utilize the bluetooth. Why would I have spent the money on a vehicle with bells and whistles that I cannot even use?! I could have kept my perfectly reliable Ford and not had the almost 7 trips to the dealership only to be told they just don't know what's wrong.",neg
"I love the look and technology of this car. I own a 2014 GC Limited. UConnect it great. Love that I can start my car from my desk. Not the best navigation. And now on to the transmission, terrible. Car doesn't shift gears properly. Car is constantly jerking because it is not in the proper gear because it didn't downshift/upshift properly. If you slow down for a red light but do not completely stop when you step on the gas the car doesn't go then suddenly jumps to 3rd for 4th gear causing the whole car to jerk. Make a turn across traffic at your own risk...because of the shifting problem car will hesitate (stop) and although you may have enough time to complete the turn you might not. Been to dealership 5 times and their answer is ""that's not abnormal."" I have had 3 updates in 6 months but none have fixed the problem. At first all I wanted was the car fixed...now I am feeling a little burned. My money was good enough to take, including the purchase of the protection warranty (covers all different parts of tranny but not whole tranny)but I am not significant enough to have my car fixed. Just want to get rid of it at this point.",neg
"the day it left the lot, nothing but suspension problems, transmission problems. in shop total of 25days out of 30 days owned. Service repairman not instructed on new mechanics of this car. The new suspension on this car is horrible and transmission is punchy affected all passengers ride. jerks when slowing from 2nd to first gear not recommend this car",neg
"I initially reviewed this car on Aug. 8th, having owned the car for 1 month (see ""Good Styling and Function, But..). At month 2, my review has worsened, having had to bring it in for service twice due to faulty computer issues and transmission problems. The computer issues have been minor compared to others I've read, but are annoying nonetheless. My radio presets are there one day, gone the next. The NAV screen freezes on an area, and the clock stops keeping time. More annoying is the transmission. In regular transmission mode, the car will jump from 1st gear into 2nd gear at slow speeds (like bumper to bumper traffic on the Washington beltway) or in a parking lot, even if you've come off the accelerator. It also slows too abruptly when coming down off of higher speeds. In general the transmission in this car needs to be reworked. And even though Jeep is aware of the issue that consumers are having, they say the transmission is working properly. My advice is to hold off purchasing this car until they get the computer and transmission issues resolved. I will try to give another update in the next month or 2.",neg
"I had the vehicle for 3 weeks and was really enjoying it. The size is perfect for my family of four and we were planning on taking it on a few long trips this fall. That all changed when the transmission failed. When pulling on to a rural road the Jeep lurched and didn't go and then it went into limp mode. Luckily we were only 2 miles from home and we were able to get home safely. I can only imagine the hassles if we had been 400 miles from home on one of our trips. The Jeep was put on a flatbed and arrived at the dealer at 10:30am on a Monday. I can only assume the service department was too busy to look at that first day because when I called them at 5pm they told me they would get to it the next day. After evaluating it on day 2 they informed me that it needed a whole new transmission. I was there yesterday (1 week later) and they didn't know when they would have the new transmission. They did provide a minivan rental vehicle that smells like an ashtray. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this vehicle at this time. That may change depending on how Chrysler resolves this issue. We shall see.",neg
"My GC has had electrical problems since the week after I bought it. The touchscreen shut off, steering wheel locked up, and Jeep has refused to fix it even though I hear about other complaints of the same issue. This is my first AND LAST Jeep.",neg
"I want potential buyers to be advised. I've had ""air suspension cooling down please wait"" warning message go off constantly. ""Air suspension needs to be serviced immediately, 4x4 disabled Please stop"" go off a few other times. The service technicians are baffled, since the car is not actual doing what these warning lights say they are doing. They've been trying to contact ""Chrysler Engineers"" who have not been returning their calls or emails. It's still sitting in the shop. Whether it gets fixed or not, I no longer feel comfortable driving this car, nor should I be dealing with this after spending $46k!!",neg
"Purchased a 2014 Jeep Overland end of April and didn't have it a full 30 days before it was in the shop. I loved the looks and the way the SUV drove when originally purchased. However the UConnect screen has locked up, blacked out and froze. One time it froze and wouldn't let me change the volume of the stereo even w/ the knob below screen. These glitches came and went but now Jeep is in the shop bc the whole panel touch screen as well as dash screen flashed errors. It also appears that the parts are not in stock and will take weeks to repair. I'm hoping their resolution will be a final fix but it doesn't sound like it will. All in all I'm not happy with my purchase. This is not reliable and with any new car you expect reliability. I think they rolled out the 2014's before they should have.",neg
"After owning five Fords, decided to try a 2014 Jeep Overland. Bought on Friday and took it back on Monday. Got it back a week later and took it back a week later and haven't seen it again. Issues: GPS screen goes blank, GPS screen gets distorted, GPS nav doesn't talk, side car alarm sounds and won't shut off, radio won't turn down or up just stays at the same volume....and the list goes on. Now, if I pull over, cut car off and re-crank, it will sometimes reset everything and work sometimes. Jeep dealer did a USB software glitch update first time I brought it in. Second time they said they were going to have to replace entire system. They've had it this time almost two weeks. Told us today there isn't one sitting on a shelf that they can get and they can't tell us when it will ever be fixed. So it has sat in their garage more than mine. They say the 2013 models don't have this issue. It's only the 2014 models. What I don't understand is why they are still advertising and selling them I'f they know there is a computer glitch.",neg
"I was so excited to get my 2014 Grand Cherokee limited. When I picked it up, it was great. It drove very well - I stayed with the V6 rather than upgrading. It was comfortable, and just all around everything I hoped. The Tech features are very cool, they take a little time to become familiar with all of the options though. After a few days of driving it, I was on the highway when it had an issue. First the instrument cluster stopped working, then it would not accelerate. The engine whined pretty loudly, then the whole car shut down, and I coasted for a few second. It came back on, and accelerated quickly. Luckily, there was nobody right in front of me. As of today, the Grand Cherokee is in the shop for the third time, all similar issues. The dealer has tried replacing the catalytic converter and the oxygen sensors... I'll see what they come up with this time. Chrysler's customer service so far has not been much help at all.",neg
"This vehicle had bent rotors noticed after 60 miles (from factory). The side view mirrors are too large and obstruct view when driving. The seats are too low (not adjustable) for reaching the ATM machines, paying for parking, etc. Gas mileage is not economical. Very hard to park due to low driver's seat and long front end. Vehicle not a year old yet. Cannot wait to sell.",neg
"After driving the Jeep Grand Cherokee for 8 months, my right leg began to go numb. After analyzing the situation, I determined that the front seat doesn't line up properly with the pedals and steering wheel. The brake pedal is too far to the left and it forces you to bring your right leg too far across to the left to break. Further, your body is always at about a ten degree angle to the left from center in the seat. I am now sitting on pillows to force my body to the left in the seat. The pillows force my body to the left and I am now centered with the steering wheel and pedals, however, my body is now hanging off the side of the seat. In summary, either the seat isn't lined up properly with the pedals or the pedals aren't lined up with the seat. Something is off and it is extremely uncomfortable. I am going to have to look to sell the car as a result of this.",neg
"This is a very good looking vehicle, but it does not comfortably handle bumpy roads in New Orleans. I thought a Jeep would handle the road much better, however, it actually hurts to drive this car. It feels every bump, rock and every imperfection in the road. Also the side view mirrors are located in the wrong place which obstructs my view. I have to look around them in order to avoid hitting something. I am embarassed driving friends around because of the bumpy, rough ride it provides. I will be selling this vehicle very soon.",neg

"The new grand Cherokee has totally forgotten where it came from. True Jeeps are tough, high riding trucks that can go anywhere. The new Wk (Short term for Grand Cherokee) is just a grocery getter. It sits too low to do any true off-roading without major modifications, all the luxury junk inside just weigh the thing down, causing the fuel mileage to be horrible and would cause the thing to get stuck every 2 feet on a true trail. And even worse is it doesn't even come with 4 wheel drive standard, that's an extra 3 grand!! And now that Chrysler is owned by Fiat (aka ""Fix It Again Tony"") the thing is bound to be totally unreliable. My overall opinion: This is just another good truck turned to junk by people who have no idea what they are doing and i do not recommend it to anyone who needs a truck.",neg
"Worst new car I ever bought. Evident vibrations at idle. Brought to service 4 times including a different location. All said it was normal. In the old days they would have adjusted the idle, cleaned the carburator and or fuel pump. Couldn't wait to trade in after 1 year. When I was at speed it was fine, but at idle very uncomforting to feel and I mean FEEL the vibrations, especially when the A/C was on..",neg
"This is my second Subaru and I did not hesitate to buy another, now I regret it. After two oil changes in 5,000 miles it started using oil at a rate of MORE than a quart every 1,000 miles. Currently having a oil consumption test but noted the dealer over filled the car by a 1/4 quart when I got home.",neg
"Planned to get a Forester when my Jeep Cherokee (the small one) needed to be replaced. Then the Forester grew, and not just a little. Now it is significantly larger than my Cherokee and I need to find something else as a replacement. Sad since we have owned 3 other Subarus and are very pleased with them.",neg
"Lots of people love this car and it is well rated so we bought one. It is a complete rattle trap. The doors rattle, the center console rattles the steering console rattles. There are videos on Youtube that SHOW these problems SEE VIDEO When you take it to the dealer and SHOW them the videos it still take them a week to fix it. Really? they have never seen this before? Sadly for the squeaks where there are no videos they are clueless- I am selling this 1 yr. old car today and getting a Pruis V. Sabaru should have stuck to selling simple reliable cars",neg
My entire family has had subarus. I bought this one when our child was born hoping to keep it until she was in her teenage years. I have had several issues with it burning oil. Dealership has been unhelpful. Subaru has been helpful. Now looking to offload it and will not be buying a Subaru again.,neg
"I have owned this car for a few weeks now and very disappointed. I am 6'2"" and don't fit the car. The distance from the pedals to the steering wheel is to short. If I slide the seat closer for comfortable steering my legs are cramped if I back the seat up then my arms are stretched out to reach the wheel. The drivers seat is very uncomfortable and no combination of seat and steering wheel adjustment makes it comfortable. The dash illumination is a hideous red which is distracting when driving at night. There is a lot of road noise that makes listening to the radio difficult. At high RPM it sounds like the engine is going to explode. I have a half hour commute and can't wait to get out of this vehicle each day.",neg
"Clumsy dull steering, very poor seating, too few compartments, miserable little backup screen, off -centered instrument cluster, rough ride. Good gas mileage. Should have bought the last of the 2013's.",neg
"I've driven a 2006 Forester until now which I loved, but unfortunately hit a deer (great crash test results, however!) This one has some pros: roomy, great views, love the CVT, peppy, nice radio, but: This car has the worst ride of any vehicle I've ever driven. I don't know how they passed this new suspension. If you have back problems or kidney problems, this is not your vehicle. You will feel every tiny bump in the road. Other reviewers have called the ride 'skittish', 'unsettled', 'jittery', 'tiresome and annoying'. I agree with all of those. It is a very hard ride, very jarring - constantly bumping and jostling, while at the same time rocking side to side. It's a shame because I can't really enjoy the vehicle's many good properties because I am non-stop gritting my teeth with annoyance about the ride. Subaru really dropped the ball on this one. If I had driven it for a while other than a round the block test drive, I would have made a different choice. I've aired down the tires and that doesn't help much.",neg
"I own this car and would not buy it again, I owned a 2011, it had oil consumption problems that took 6 months to get help with and then on the freeway my catalytic converter blew out from too much oil build up! They convinced me that the 2014 was the way to go and I would not have this problem again, well yesterday my low engine oil light came on(I change my oil as recommended by Subaru) and I was a quart low! Here we go again. Oh and by the way Subaru says burning that much oil is normal.",neg
I bought the car a few days ago.It feels very unsafe. I can't see out the rear view mirror at night because it is so dimmed. I feels like there are blind spots that I didn't have in my old car. Cargo cover is extra on even the premium model though the model I was shown had it. I feel like I am stuck with a car I hate driving.,neg
"I have had my 2014 Forester 2.5i premium trim for about 3 months now and am really disappointed in the ride of this new model. i turned in a 2010 Forester, same model and trim, then leased this new model. I was so looking forward to this new design that changed the side view mirrors and front windshield design, That had been my only complaint in the 2010 model. The mirror placement created a huge blind spot , especially when turning left. I saw the 2014 at the Detroit International Auto Show and was trilled to see the change in mirror design. I couldn't wait to lease this new car! I was expecting my 2010 with the mirror fix. Boy was I shocked when I drove it home.(MY big mistake was not test driving the car I leased, it came from out of state. Lesson Learned for you readers, Drive the car you think you want BEFORE signing any papers.) The ride is terrible. The car ""bounces"" my word, the auto word I guess is ""firm"" over, any kind of road imperfection, not just the obvious pot holes. It is very uncomfortable and annoying to have your body and car constantly shaking or quivering. Subaru tells me it's the redesign of the suspension that makes for a more firm ride. If you like a comfortable ride for city driving this is NOT the car for you!! I have always relied on the quality and safety of a Subaru, but time will tell if this model lives up to those standards.",neg
"If you can tolerate the seats, you'll love this vehicle. I'd been test driving cars for a couple of months and finally took my wife out to test drive the cars I liked best. We got into the new 2014 Forester 2.5i and she LOVED it just like me! Quiet, responsive handling, smooth ride, and nicely equipped. Luckily we took it on an extended test drive instead of just around the block. After 20 minutes our legs and backs were feeling uncomfortable. After 40 minutes it was just downright painful. The seats are too short, too narrow, and the passenger seat is too high! (my wife also felt like the driver's seat was leaning to the left, which I had never noticed.) We were so disappointed since we loved every other aspect of the vehicle. Afterwards I searched the internet and found that Subaru seats have caused back and leg pain in hundreds of customers. Some of them lost thousands of dollars because they had to sell or trade it in for a new car because they couldn't tolerate the seats. So make sure to take it on an extended test drive. Come on Subaru! Listen to your customers! People shouldn't have to find after market solutions to seating discomfort in a brand new vehicle!",neg
"Needed an AWD on our hill for the winter, but also needed space for our camping, hiking & biking trips. Lost some space when we sold our minivan for this, but still has plenty of storage. Wish the console was a little bigger-it is deep. Also the console which serves as the elbow rest is short, so really unusuable as an elbow rest if the seat is forward.  Very easy to fold down the seats & love the sun/moon roof. Great turning radius  but haven't driven it off road yet. Plenty of pickup. Auto climate control is a little tricky to figure out. But overall, felt it is a much better buy & better visibility than a Santa Fe Hyundai, Ford escape, Honda, or chevy equinox. Nissan rogue & even the subaru outback.",pos
Highly Recomend This car!!,pos
"I can’t speak to the long term reliability but  the 2018 Forester is in the last year of its current generation, so theoretically most of the bugs have been worked out and a lot of the little imperfections have been smoothed out. These facts made my decision easier, any knowledgeable mechanic will tell you not to buy a vehicle in the first couple years of its current generation. 

I’ve drove automatic V6 vehicles for the last 10 plus years and was apprehensive about a 4 cylinder CVT drivetrain. I was instantly shocked how smooth and powerful the combo transfed thd power. The 4 cylinder boxer/Cvt feels soo much more refined than my V6/autos up hill, highway merging, passing on highway, absolutely no compromise or concerns! I can’t say enough how happy I am with the mechanical performance. I also got to drive it around in 3 inches if snow it was as surefooted in the snow as any 4wd vehicle I’ve ever driven. With last years added sound deadening  I found the cabin to very quiet and comfortable. Also the suspension feels composed on rough roads. 

It would of been nice if the 2018’s came with Apple Car Play but it wasn’t a deal breaker, as the factory Starlink 7 in. unit is pretty slick, and has performed perfectly.

Gas mileage has been really good so far, and I would expect it to get even better after the 1000 mile break in period us done. 

I wanted a Jeep Wrangler my entire life but once I started researching Wranglers I quickly saw the Jeeps  lacks value, and safety features. To me the Forester seemed like the perfect substitute for a Wrangler. The Forester has an panoramic moonroof, way more safety features, gets way better mpg, and most likely way better reliability. Not to mention Subaru gas better financing and are considerably cheaper msrp than a comparable Wrangler. Not to turn this into a dump on a Wrangler review, nothing else totally compares to one but for my situation this is what made sense.",pos
Always bought Honda and Toyota now I’ve been converted.,pos
Only disappointment was that routine maintenance was not included during the warranty period.,pos
"My 2018 Subaru Forester is wonderful! They have made improvements since the 2012 model (my last car)--better acceleration, quieter & roomier interior, much smaller blind spot.",pos
"Reliable, great drive, easy handling and no fatigue, a bit punchy initial acceleration and effortless cruising, sure braking, easy getting in and out, great cornering, fantastic on snow and ice- full time dynamic AWD, traction control etc., great on gas (have got 41 on some trips), good cargo through hatch with back seats folded down and roof rack, great visibility but no tinting, uncomfortable in summer. Ok infotainment and electronics, phone pairing lost often, daylight savings does not stick. A bit stiff ride (needed for an SUV). Hood of soft material (aluminium perhaps) dropping acorns put three dents, body panels similarly feel soft. Body seems to have a bit of flexi which adds to its comfort on trails, not an extreme off-roader but enough for the unpaved trails.",pos
Great SUV for the money,pos
the headrests are a little hard and push forward a bit.,pos
"A good deal of research and positive reviews in favor of Subaru is what moved us down the path to purchase the Forester.  We're newbie's with less than 200 miles on the unit however really enjoying all the features. Navigation, the Starlink system, and Mirrorlink are poorly developed.  Although the local dealership and salesperson seemed quite knowledgeable they could not get the Mirrorlink system to work even though all the software on both my phone and the vehicles's display unit (Heads-up) are compatible. I suspect using Google Maps for navigation will continue however I will also continue to work with Subaru on the Mirrorlink system. The Forester was purchased primarily for the gas mileage and other features (beyond navigation) so we're pleased so far.",pos
Our Last Subaru was very good but high maintenance cost after 40 k miles,pos
"Investigate options and incentives being offered, so you won’t be over charged. The Subaru Forester is a great automobile, excellent rating for safety, roomy, versatile, and back seats lay flat for large cargo. My last Subaru Forester lasted fifteen years and I just purchased a 2018 Subaru Forester I expect it to last another fifteen years!",pos
"I test drove several cars and a few trucks including the CRV, Rav4, Tacoma, and Escape. I loved the Forester Premium XT Turbo and ordered one in early January. I love the minor changes including the boxier front end. I have only been driving it for a few weeks but I am more than pleased. I wasn't looking for mind blowing mileage since I ordered the turbo, and am happy averaging 25 MPH with a mixture of city/highway driving. On a recent 400 mile trip I averaged 28 MPG. The comfort is very good and the visibility is outstanding. Subaru has vastly improved the quietness of this vehicle. The leg room is great, even in the backseat. My 5' 10"" 250 pound frame fits this SUV very comfortably, and the vehicle is easy to get in & out of. I was never real technical and the backup camera, blue tooth phone capability (downloaded my entire phone list, works great) , and simple GPS system meet my standards. It has starlink (similar to onstar) and Siriusxm radio I am currently using, will evaluate and decide whether to keep them.",pos
"I considered a number of vehicles to replace my wife's car.  We finally settled on the Subaru Forester as being the best quality, safety and value vehicle.  The comfort and convenience features of the touring model made the choice easy, so much so that I replaced not just my wife's car, but mine as well.  Lots of perks for the price.  Handles great.  Acceleration is good, I found it to be much better than I've read on some reviews (it actually accelerates better than my wife's old Hyundai Sonata).  The crash avoidance, lane drift and adaptive cruise control are must haves.  Since I do most of my own repair work, I didn't opt for the extended warranty.  The cargo cover tends to make a slight metallic rattle on rough roads.",pos
"We have only had the car for about 1,000 miles, so some questions don't apply.  Overall, we are very happy with the purchase.",pos
Stayed with a Subaru. This is our 4th Subie in 15 yers. 1st one retired after 250000 miles. 2nd one (Outback 07)was totaled by a hit and run We lurched this on for all of the safety improvements.,pos
Take your time to go through the process in making your decision. The Subaru dependability and Forester Touring Model is a great combination! We really like this car!,pos
I have only had the car got three weeks but am very happy with the car so far. This may be more valid if I had 60 Thousand miles on the car.,pos

"I spent the better part of a year researching SUV's as I'm also the owner of a 2004 Tacoma TRD Off-Road.  Having spent 13 years in that truck, I was getting a little tired of the stiff ride and poor gas mileage, but I need something that can handle some off-road as well as poor driving conditions in the winter.  I was thinking of trading my truck for either a new Tacoma or a 4Runner, but really didn't feel like I'd get anything very different, especially from an MPG standpoint.  Enter the Forester.  My biggest concern was the available ""get up and go"" since I live at about 6100 ft in Colorado and frequently drive into the mountains where 10,000+ ft is common.  The XT was an obvious consideration but the MPG of the Limited 2.5i was very enticing.  After test driving the 2.5i up the local pass, I decided it would suffice.  I've got 2000 miles on the car and many of them are mountain driving.  No power issues whatsoever!  I'll admit I'm not racer, but I usually go about 5mph over the speed limit and have really had no problem with acceleration or keeping the speed up at all with the 2.5i.  If I could have gotten blind spot and RCTA on the XT without going all the way to a Touring model, I'd have probably gone that route (although I much prefer regular gas to premium).  Anyway, the Limited 2.5i has a very comfortable ride and I'm averaging about 28mpg in town and 35mpg on the interstate...again, at real altitude!  Also, I got to keep my truck!  I couldn't be happier with my decision.",pos
"It was time for a replacement for my Jetta TDI. Living in New England it is four wheel drive or walk home. I am a retired businessman living on a fixed income so getting the best value is important. I narrowed the search to a Kia Sorento and the Forester. Both were impressive on the test drives with the Forester edging out the win by being tighter and quieter. The layout of the cockpit was better in the Forester and I was able locate and understand marginally better. Once I began driving I became more impressed with all of the aspects of the Forester. It does things for me like; reminding me to stay in my lane, put my brakes on to slow properly, eyes in the back of my head with the camera. It is not going to win a drag race but I can merge into traffic with no problem. Bottom line is, It feels solid and drives the miles in an honest and straightforward way. I am actually looking forward to snow season this year.",pos
"Having driven Honda's for many years, & deciding it was time to give up my Honda Pilot of 13 years, & decided to downsize, I chose a Subaru because of its safety features and realiability.  I also ski in the winter, & weather & road conditions in our area can be pretty tricky at times, but with the all wheel drive I hope to get great traction.  My lease specialist (Brad Lunar) was very thorough throughout the entire process and made me feel comfortable with his expertise.",pos
"Very comfortable car, performs quite well. Based upon friends & neighbors who own them, Subaru Foresters & Outbacks are extremely reliable, great in snow & ice. We only have 400 miles, but very confident reputation is valid. Looking forwward to trying the Forester in the mountains this winter.",pos
"Review at 1000 miles:   We spent the last six months researching and test driving for our first new purchase.  We had a budget of $35k and the final three contenders were the BMW X1, Honda CR-V Touring and the Subaru Forester XT Touring.    We live at altitude in the Pacific Northwest and are ""outdoorsy"" without needing extreme off road capability.   We also take the highway up to fairly high altitudes for hiking and ski excursions.  Coming from a fun & spirited but extremely noisy and uncomfortable Impreza, we were looking for a good blend of comfort and utility.  Forester XT Touring satisfied these criteria with the added FUN factor that the CRV just didn't bring to the table.  The Forester XT has *almost* all of the get-up-and-go of a WRX with off road capability and a far, far quieter ride.  I find the CVT to be quite responsive, particularly in the Sport mode.  Interior comfort is impressive;  I'm 6'4"" and 220 lbs, and have so far taken three 2+ hour trips behind the wheel, on highway and Forest Service roads.  The cabin is quiet, with excellent visibility on all sides.   While not quite the same in terms of luxury, at this price point, to get the AWD on the X1, we'd have been dropping closer to $40k.  I just couldn't justify paying the premium for mostly a badge.  Only qualms so far is the entertainment suite: Starlink is basically useless aside from Pandora.  Navigation combined with Sirius XM traffic is quite useful.  Eyesight suite is powerful, useful and intuitive and is what ultimately swayed our purchase.  Considering our Impreza lasted reliable 275k miles with strict maintenance, I am confident that the Forester XT will be reliable for years to come and serve our needs well.",pos
"Hit a deer with my 2015 Forester and totaled it. I liked it so much, I bought a 2017 Forester, but not before I test drove just about everything in its price range. The Forester still suited my needs best for economy, real 4wd ability, roominess , handling,  ground clearance, and acceleration from a stop. I rated this car highly in just about every category compared to similarly priced suvs . The CVT transmission is particularly well suited to this car, reacting quickly to throttle input on hills and stop signs where others searched for gears or just would not get the car moving in a timely fashion creating some hairy moments when trying to get into traffic. When going on a trip, my wife wants to take everything, including the sink, but somehow, we manage to get it all in. Muddy fields, washed out farm roads, and interstates have been no problem. I am not saying this is the best suv out there, but it is hard to find a base model suv that will do most everything well. This one comes as close as anything I could find, in 2015 and 2017.",pos
"Great car, my first automatic a real reliable pleasure to drive. For an SUV, extremely comfortable.  Got it for the winter and I have been using it all the time.",pos
"Traded in my 2015 Rave 4 with 10k miles for 2017 Subaru Forester Touring. The ABS ""REALLLLY"" works faster than I could. Avoided a collision when a fool cut right in front of me. when my foot hit the brakes the pedal was already down with inches to spare.",pos
"This is our 6th Subaru, and so far best one yet, powerful, good looking, EyeSight is really great better then anybody else so far, stock tires not so good, took them of at the dealer and put Michelin Premier AS just to be safe, stock one sold on craigslist, we've got all possible options on it, and we really love it, brown interior looks great, really fun to drive, definatly recommend to any one who is looking for Subaru, visibility are tremendous too.",pos
Past tests have rated this vehicle very favorable.,pos
"This is a great car so far, I wish I would have bought one much sooner",pos
"Add body side moldings, door edge guards, rear bumper cover and side window deflectors as accessories as most dealer lot models are displayed without.  These can be dealer installed and protect the door edge, body side panels and bumper from damage. Side window deflectors are great as they allow driver and passenger window to be slightly opened while keeping out rain.",pos
"This is our third Subaru, the first was an Outback it's equity helped us get out of a Mini Cooper S lease. No problems with the wagon at all, wasn't happy about the looks but great for beach and carrying around a new born. Then we thought she since she is getting older we could get by with the sportier looking Subaru Crosstrek. Great car for beach and dependable averaged 32-33 MPG in the city, a bit slower than the Outback. But we soon realized that it was to small for the three of us, no problems with any of the vehicles( oil burning, unusual trips to dealer). We took the Crosstrek in for routine maintenance and test drove a Forester 2.5i premium excellent vehicle getting 30 MPG in the city , real quite inside, seating position is quite a bit taller and a lot more cargo space :-] . Loaded it up this past weekend and went to the beach, the all wheel drive system is better than Crosstrek, we never got stuck in it but there is an obvious difference. The text to speech function, 8"" display, power drivers seat, reclining rear seat , rear center arm rest with cup holders and the panoramic sun roof are great. I replaced the interior light bulbs with leds they make the interior look better at night. A definite keeper..",pos
Assembled in Indiana. Have had 4 SUV's and this one ranks among the best I have owned,pos
"Update:  I've owned the Forester for over 7 months now.  I still love the car.   The only slight negative I've noticed is that with the 23mpg and a 16 gallon gas tank.  I have to fill up a few more times a year as the range with my driving history on a full tank is under 400 miles.  

I had a 2009 Mazda 6 Grand Touring with a 6 speed stick because it was fun to drive.   The Forester XT is just as fun and I'm going to love driving in the snow.  So far, all my driving has been city and I'm avg about 23mpg.  Not too bad as I have a bit of a lead foot and a turbo.  The sport sharp mode is great fun and quick.  I really like the feel of this car on the road.  It's quiet and handles well.   The ride is surprisingly comfortable even compared to my wife's Legacy.   Turning into a parking spot is excellent compared to most cars I've driven (I travel quite a lot so drive many different types of rental cars).   I can't think of much I don't like.  There a few 'it would be nice' things; a bigger console, easier way to switch between radio and USB while driving, a little stiffer-feeling brake pedal (just feels a little soft after the Mazda).... that's about it.    I drove it in very heavy rain a  couple times where it plowed through 6 inches of water and kept me straight, really confident.   Eyesight (with adaptive cruise), lane assist, automatic braking, rear traffic detection are all really good reasons to buy the higher Subaru trims.   I'm very ok with the CVT (turbo XT gets a better transmission than 2.5 trims).  The CVT shifts fine, I like that I can set the cruise and it will slow me to the set speed going down fairly good hills without hitting the brakes.   I like to play with the paddle shifters once in a while just for fun.   I'm pretty sure if no one ever mentioned it had a CVT most people wouldn't actually notice.    I looked at the 2017 Outbacks but the Forester is much easier to get into and out of than the Outback.  It's got fantastic vision - you can see everything around you.",pos
"My Forester Premium with EyeSight is the most effortless vehicle to operate that I have ever owned.  It is effortless for me at 6 ft., 225 lbs to get into, and my wife at 5'1"" also finds it very easy to get into.  The seats are very comfortable and the seating position great.  Visibility is great also.  I fold the second row seats down and visibility probably rivals that of the Pope Mobile.  Driving it is effortless also, acceleration is more than adequate, handling is nimble, parking it is the easiest I've ever experienced, other than my old Jeep Wrangler, and the ride on the highway feels ""well connected"" to the road.  It's quieter than my 2011 Toyota Highlander Limited and the engine is about as smooth.  I have averaged 34 MPG over 14,000 miles, getting 38 MPG at posted highway speeds, and occassionally 40 - 41 MPG when keeping speed below 65 MPH.  The EyeSight really helps take stress off on long trips, with the adaptive cruise control being especially helpful.  I'm now considering trading my Highlander in on an Outback to get the EyeSight feature on my wife's vehicle, though, she rarely drives the Highlander anymore, opting for the Forester instead.  A great vehicle at a very reasonable price.",pos
"Great vehicle, but you may want to check out the front seat first.  I have had trouble for quite some time tying to get the front seat to adjust to me properly so much so that my left leg and often my left arm does not go numb within a 1/2 hour of my drive.  Believe I have tried every combination with the seat and steering wheel.  It may be because the seat needs some time to soften up or it may be due to my height. The seat hits me under my knees, due to the length of the seat pan.  About two weeks into owing the car it has not cause as much of an issue.  The seat may be softening or I have figured out how to adjust it just so.  Just pray you do not have to move it like I did and then try to find that spot that worked again.  I just ordered two different type of seat cushions to see if that will help. The first one not so much yet.  Otherwise I love the car! It has a great HD radio.  I love that I can see all around me while driving in traffic.  I love the big windows, especially in the back!  I have not had time to play with all the other new gadgets yet, so I can not speak to them.",pos
"My wife and I test drove several vehicles from different manufactures.  Our last vehicle being a Toyota Camry Hybrid.  That was our baseline vehicle to compare our evaluation with.  The Toyota had great power and gas millage, but had some funky placement of controls (i.e., the cruise control being behind the steering wheel).  We found the Subaru Forester Touring 2.0XE, to be the best at meeting all our requirements.  The most important being Safety, where Subaru has done a great job with their eyesight system.  I particularly like the lane departure features, that will nudge you back into the lane before you cross over the lane marker.  For example, Toyota, only gives a verbal beep with no correction, and for someone who has high frequency hearing loss, you will never hear it.  The only thing I cannot hear in the Forester is the turn signal, however the Outback it was easy to hear.  The adaptive cruise control, greatly enhances the driving pleasure in congested traffic that is always slowing down and speeding up.  I only with it was a little faster on braking when approaching traffic that has stopped, especially in light traffic where it may not have locked on to a vehicle in front of it.  Gas millage is in the lower to mid twenty mpg range using premium gas for the turbo engine; which gives excellent power, especially for getting on to the Interstate Hwy with it's high speeds especially with a short on ramp.  The 360 view cannot be beat, with all that glass; however, we are glad that we had premium tint put on the windows and especially the moon roof, which greatly reduces the heating from solar radiation.  Living in a high desert, the sun can really brat down on you.  The headlights have what I call tunnel vision found on many vehicles these days.  Subaru, has helped with the side lighting, by having the headlights pivot in the direction of your turn, helping with the driver's side vision in the direction of the turn.   Have not had a chance to use or with only limited use, I can not fully evaluate other features yet.  We had most options added, however the cargo barrier is not a pet barrier for smaller dogs, and had it taken off.  This being a turbo, we could nor add several items on the front bumper.  Very pleased with our purchase, will consider another review later after I have driven it in all seasons.",pos
"For the cost, all safety features, all wheel drive, saddle interior, great visibly.  Whole package is tough to beat",pos
I loved every one of my Foresters.  Subaru is a company that puts quality and safety and clean air above profits.  The service I received at dealerships has always been done as scheduled with no unpleasant surprises.  They make it easy to stay loyal to the Subaru brand.,pos
"I recommend that a potential buyer should compile lists of their ""must haves"", might like to have and ""don't need"" features and options. During my shopping the finalists were Honda CR-V and Subaru Forester. With Honda their is very little room for building in your feature choices...the models are limited and each is ""set"" with its package of features- nice if you don't like making decisions. The Forester, on the other hand, has a larger selection of models to choose from so that you can customize the features AND price to your needs. Make sure to ask for the one page ""breakdown"" of the models and what comes with each. Furthermore you can get a more detailed listing of what is offered with each model on their website. I think in all my years of car buying this was the most informed decision I've been able to make. My experience with the sales staff was excellent. They know their cars and are straight forward in their approach- no ""hocus pocus"" with their answers and no pressure to buy instantly.",pos
Great vehicle and great service from the dealership,pos
"Comfortable like an old pair of jeans!! Too early to tell on some issues but having owned a Subaru for the last 6 years I expect ownership will not be troublesome at all. Past service experience has been VERY good. Update 10/4/17. Forester has become a ""Sunday car"" of sorts. Usage will pick up when the snow flies I'm sure. Have not had any issues with fit, finish, operation, or function of any systems or features on this machine. The stadium seating works well for my wife in terms of visibility and allows her to enter and exit with ease. The only service so far has been the oil change. Great car for us!",pos

Go to Edmonds.com and get internet prices.  No haggle with dealership.  Wish I knew this before with previous car purchases.,pos
This is a very sensible and practical vehicle.  To me it drives like a pickup truck which is a positive.  It handles bumpy roads well and is effortless to steer (others felt like you had to coax them to move). You sit high and window visibility in all directions is outstanding.    High marks for entry and exit.  All wheel drive is standard.  Many competitors offer AWD only as an option and then only on the high end models.,pos
"My Subaru history is a bit unique. My wife has owned 5 Subarus: 3 outbacks and 2 Crosstreks going back to the 90s. I now have owned 3, all Foresters. Unique? 2015 Limited. 2016 Limited. 2017 Touring XT - the King. Prior, I drove: 94 Nissan Pathfinder, 2003 Nissan Xterra, 2005 Xterra and an 08 Nissan Rogue for 180k miles. I had a bad bait and switch experience with a Nissan dealer when it was time to trade the Rogue. To the Subaru dealer I went, tested and purchased in the most easy, straight forward transaction I ever had. Loved the 15, got a call from the dealer asking if I would trade for a 16? Amazing resale trade value was an offer too good to pass. Had the 16 for 18 months and 18k miles. I had a performance itch. I went online with a query and had multiple dealers quickly respond. I kbb'd my Limited's book value and went deal'n. I soon found out how rare availability was for xt touring models. More so for color/option choice. Order waiting from Japan was 3/4 months. One dealer had a prior ordered Pearl White w Saddle Brown Leather interior ready to arrive within days. I was there to see it backed off truck w 3 miles on the Odometer. A 4 mile test drive sold me. Easy deal with my Limited's great retained trade value.  3 days later I'm still giddy with the Performance UPGRADE! Add the lux and safety and sound system (Harmon Kardon 440watt), Wheels and Exhaust upgrades over Stacked Limiteds... just Slammed. This ride destroys an Audi Q5 that costs over 50k in 0-60 and qm times and crushes it off road. I love a deal. I love and require reliable. I love real world functionality. Add this level of Luxury and Performance? Feeling Fine! 
Now at nearly 4k miles and 7 months of ownership, i can say I still love my choice and like new ride. Zero problems. I added stainless gas and brake pedals to up the sport and Love factor. The ride is Fast and I always drive with the #S button pushed to max the Sti turbo factor. Amazing “sleeper” factor reveals itself often at stop lights, on-ramps and xways! Macho $$$  status machines see my rear lights often and humble pie is Served. I once had a hopped up Mustang. With this XT, i get to enjoy the same thrills in a much more reliable and functional and modern Chariot! For the price... there is no competition. The Real competition is much, much more expensive.
Update at 1 year ownership. Still like new. Quality workmanship and materials in my Touring XT have proven themselves and wear and tear hasn’t presented itself. Eyesight system was recalibrated at first oil change at 5,000 miles under warranty after I noticed rear automatic braking wasn’t quite working as it should. Works great now and gives comfort and confidence should surprising incidents occur.
Engine and Performance still thrill and I just love goosing the accelerator whenever I can. This is just an enjoyable ride to drive....Anywhere! I live in a remote location only accessible by a hilly, pothole filled,  mile long,  one lane dirt road that any car or vehicle without 4wd would be wise to avoid. No problems with the Foz in the mud or in the ample snow faced this year.
Recently, upgraded exhaust system. Replaced perfectly fine and still like new stock exhaust with an ‘Invidia’ 3” custom cat back stainless steel exhaust for greater performance and sweet sounds.
My pearl white ultimate performance Forester XT Touring continues to Rock. My Sweet Ride continues to get approving looks and grudging approval from owners of much more expensive and less able vehicles.",pos
"We bought our first Subaru Forester in 2002 and are still driving it everyday.  We are amazed how much better the design, technology, and functionality have improved in the 2017.  We look forward to driving this Forester another 15 years!

We are STILL driving the 2002 Forester and our 2017 is so much better. We often are asked if we are interested in selling our 2002.

We would agree with the 2018 Consumer Reports. There is some level of engine noise during acceleration and on start-up. But, is very quiet during normal driving. The stability and comfort is excellent. Very impressed with all the driving safety and electronic entertainment systems.",pos
"We just purchased our Forester so we can't rate the reliability and the repair costs, etc. However, the amount of room in the SUV is fantastic; great headroom, great leg room, plenty of cargo space, and even a full size spare tire!  It seems to be a great value.  We are experiencing some difficulty in understanding the directions for customizing the lists for radio stations etc.  The manual seems a little difficult to understand but we may just need more time to ""play"" with the settings etc. All in all we are quite excited about our purchase and pleased with our experience at International Subaru of Merrillville.",pos
"There are a couple things that are different from the Honda I previously owned. The Subaru boxer engine does deliver torque, but it's not quite as peppy as the iVTEC from Honda. This hasn't been an issue though because the acceleration is still pretty good. The Symmetrical AWD is hands down my favorite part of the Forester. It's awesome. Also, spring for the All Weather Package. It really doesn't cost that much to add, and the heated side mirrors are really nice to have. The de-icers at the windshield wipers are really nice as well. I live in an area that gets more ice than snow, so these are essential.",pos
"My '02 was still going strong, but new safety technology was calling so I succumbed and am so pleased. I believe you can't find a better value for the price.",pos
"Want a non luxury vehicle with lot's of features and bang for the buck ? Look no further. This is my first Subaru, and I love it ! The updates for the 2017 Forester are great and much improved from previous models. It is extremely quiet, more refined interior...I have the Saddle Brown leather...beautiful ! Exterior is Dark Gray, and looks sharp on my Touring model. The premium stereo sounds awesome, and the bluetooth is very clear. It is a fun vehicle to drive, and it offers no blind spots which is rare these days ! While it is not a fancy interior, everything is practical, and offers plenty of room for passengers and cargo. Lots of technology in the upper trim levels along with memory seats, heated seats, and a heated steering wheel. The 4wd is the best out there, so get it one and go !
UPDATE : 
I have owned the Forester for 8 months now...zero problems, getting ready for my first oil change and 5000 check- up. This is such a fun vehicle to drive !! I have been averaging 25 -27 mpg between city and highway driving. Very pleased with this mileage. I get lots of compliments with the look ! Eyesight safety is awesome and works flawlessly, and I so enjoy the sirius radio. The sound system in the Touring is awesome ! I highly recommend this vehicle to someone looking for the perfect size SUV...not too small, not to big, easy to park ! Solid, dependable !!",pos
"Was considering the 2.5L  normally aspirated engine and but I am so glad I got the 2.0L Turbo.  This SUV is quick and fun to drive with a 0 - 60 in 6.3 seconds.  Those reviewers who have said it is not I doubt actually own one or neglected to read the owners manual which describes how to use the SI Drive system to choose Sport Sharp mode for maximum driving fun. I know it was a struggle for me to find one to test drive since only 10% of Foresters shipped are turbos.  I have had the Forester XT for over a month and have not regretted a single day of driving - in sun, rain, snow, sleet and really bad ice.  Nothing stops it.    See the SubaruGlobalTV channel on YouTube  for the development videos for this current generation Forester which detail how the engineering is brilliantly executed in a well thought out design (Why? Subaru Episode....).  I got the Eyesight package and really appreciate all of the features.  Only disappointment is the Navigation system but it is bundled with Eyesight.  There are so many features in the 2.0XT Touring trim level with Eyesight  that I would insist on having in any future vehicle  - adaptive cruise control, lane sway warning, lane keep assist, pre-collision braking/throttle management, adaptive LED headlamps, reverse automatic braking, X-mode...the list is extensive.   If you are fortunate enough to get the Touring with turbo, add optional Eyesight and are willing to wait for a custom order (in my case, 3 months), you will not be disappointed!  To top it off,  Subaru was offering very competitive financing (0% at 36 mos or .9% at 48 - 63 months) and deals at or below invoice are common.",pos
This car is living up to its potetntials.,pos
"Versatile, reliable & reasonable in every respect. It will get you there in safety & comfort if not necessarily in style.",pos
"it is a small SUV, but it has plenty of room not the inside.  I love it so far, only having a bit of an issue with the USB plug-in not connecting correctly or resetting in the middle of my music.  Otherwise I LOVE IT!",pos
"My 2017 Forester gave me exactly what I was looking for - good visibility out of windows, logical controls, rear cross traffic alert and blind spot.   Acceleration and power have been good.",pos
I’ve only owned the vehicle for 2 weeks so reliability is excellent! Lane keep assist is not great but having Eyesight operating in the background is a reassurance. The ride is firm but comfortable and quiet. The Harman Kardon audio with SiriusXM is awesome. Probably not the fastest car but plenty fast for me.,pos
I have missed driving a sports car but love the ability to sit up a bit higher in a SUV.  The Subaru Forester combines both for me.  It handles like a sports car but has the advantages of an SUV.  LOVE IT!,pos
"The car does not lock itself when parked or when driving, otherwise it is very practical, with excellent visibility and plenty of passenger and cargo room.  It is very comfortable to ride in and is nicely appointed.",pos
"I have long thought of the Forester as a rather frumpy-looking car with inferior interior materials and ergonomics (my basis for comparison is my beloved 2005 Outback 2.5 XT Limited with a manual transmission). But my 2017 2.0 XT Touring edition of the Forester (with EyeSight) blows away those perceptions. While the exterior design is more purposeful than elegant, I do not find it objectionable, and the interior is a pleasant, rewarding place to pass the miles. In fact, I opted for the Forester over the Outback 3.6R Touring because I prefer the Forester's interior design and ergonomics as well as its performance and handling, which are more responsive and lively (the Outback is nice, but it's comparatively sedate). I find the build quality of the Forester to be excellent and its aesthetics appropriate to its go-anywhere character. Ingress and egress are excellent and outward visibility is superb, in contrast to competitive vehicles that have huge blind spots in the rear quarters. The Harmon Kardon audio system is very pleasing, and EyeSight does what it's designed to do, very well. The front seats are comfortable, but I wish they had a little more lateral support (because the Forester handles so well) and I wish the passenger seat provided adjustability (preferably powered) of height and lumbar support -- significant shortcomings in a vehicle of such overall quality. Also, the tailgate opens and closes rather slowly automatically, but it's quick and easy to do so manually, which I usually do. I initially had serious reservations about going to a CVT, and those reservations were confirmed when test-driving competitive vehicles, but Subaru has implemented this technology extremely well, and I'm very happy with it, in conjunction with SI-Drive. I highly recommend this vehicle for anyone who values function and usability over style, and people of all ages (I'm a ""senior"") who lead active lifestyles and appreciate a vehicle that's versatile, fun to drive, well built and safe. Yes, the price of this vehicle (loaded, with an extended warranty) approaches $40K, which might strike you as a lot to pay for a Forester, but forget your impressions of previous models; a lot of improvements were made for 2017 (sound deadening, torque vectoring, front-fascia design, steerable LED headlights, interior materials and appointments, etc.), and I consider the 2.0 XT Touring edition of the Forester to be a good value in comparison to competitive offerings. Note that I am still quite new to this car, but after some 1,500 miles, I am so enthusiastic about it that I couldn't wait to post a review. I plan to update this review at a later date if anything changes, although I believe these comments are pretty solid.

UPDATE: I now have over 17,000 miles on my Forester and can confirm that the above comments remain accurate. At the same time, I would like to add a few details that might be useful to potential buyers.  I live in the ""flatlands,"" but last year took a 3,600-mile road trip to Colorado, where Subarus seem to be the ""state car,"" since there are so many of them there -- and for good reason. The Forester handled mountain highways and rocky, steep, muddy, unpaved back roads with aplomb. It's no Jeep, so it's wise to take the rough spots gingerly, but the high ground clearance, X-Drive, S# (Sport sharp) mode, short hood (for good visibility), tight turning circle, and generous approach and departure angles worked beautifully and inspired confidence. With 8 (simulated) gear ratios in S# mode, the CVT provides fine control of engine braking going downhill, and is easily adjusted with the paddles (usually with the transmission in Manual mode). While I find S# mode a little fussy in flat country, I've come to be a great fan of it under more demanding driving conditions. While every previous car I've owned had a manual transmission, and it took me a while to adjust to the CVT, I can say now that I've become a great fan of Subaru's implementation of this technology. I've read some criticisms of it, but I have not had any of those concerns with the high-torque version of the CVT that is paired with the 2.0 XT engine. I also found that the 2.0 XT engine, with its twin-scroll turbo and direct injection, has plenty of power for high-altitude (i.e., thin-air) mountain driving. In short, of all the competitive vehicles I've tested, I consider the Touring edition of the Forester 2.0 XT to be the best blend of ""sport"" and ""utility."" It may not have the sexiest exterior styling (it hasn't completely shed its frumpiness), but I find it tasteful enough; its build quality, affordability, performance, handling, ergonomics and versatility carry the day.  I keep looking for excuses to get in and drive it. I wouldn't recommend tackling the Rubicon Trail with a Forester, but this is one great car for anyone who has an active lifestyle and enjoys exploring out-of-the-way places.",pos
Drove all of the competition and nothing performs as well as the Forester XT. We bought a Touring XT with the 2.0 Turbocharged engine. Great acceleration and handling. 30 mpg on the highway. Luxurious interior. Great handling. Priced right.,pos
"I've owned the 2017 Forester XT for about one month now. Here are come quick Pros and Cons:  Pros: I get drove several cars before deciding on this vehicle. Basically, you cant touch a car with a similar size, performance, value, resale value, engine, comfort, with any car in the price of 35K. The only other car I as excited about was the Mercedes GLC (Which was 60K out the door). The gas mileage is roughly 23mpg. Car handles well. It doesn't sit as low to the ground as my 2014 WRX, but I feel good around sharp turns and I have confidence in the car and its suspension (although I would have liked to the suspension to be 15-20% tighter). I like the infotainment system. The screen is big and it's easy to use. I didn't go with the Touring model instead I chose the premium and added a few things. The price point of the Touring for me wasn't worth it. I enjoy how high the car sits, I like it has plenty of room in the back seat and especailly for my  German Shepherd in the Trunk area. Overall, super happy with my purchase.   CONS: Subaru could have done a slightly  better job with the CVT. It's nice to drive when in sport mode but in economy mode the engine/transmission gear change lags big time. My biggest pet peeve though are the corn seats. I feel they could have been more ergonomic and better fitting. Im not a big guy, 5'8 and 160 lbs. But i feel the seat could do a better job keeping my in place instead of moving side to side around sharp turns. Other people I ride with say it's comfortable, so maybe I'm being picky. I really hope this review helps and Gluck hunting!",pos
"First small SUV for me. It runs great and is an easy drive. Nice to adjust the seat higher as well for great road visibility. It is comfortable to ride and drive. Negative for me is the cruise control seems to vary the RPMs more, even on flatter highways, than just using the pedal. This has affected overall fuel economy. Drive distances with it and it is very comfortable. Combined MPG: 28.9 in winter time, had been around 35 in fall.",pos
I knew I was going to buy a Forrester.  I got the eyesight package by mistake and am very glad I got it.  It cost an extra $1200 and worth every bit.  The insurance on the new car was a little cheaper than my six year old trade in.  The car is much better than expected for the price.,pos
"I like the car. It was between this or Honda's new HRV.  The 2017 Forester won hands down.  In fact, it works far better than this site (which won't let you paragraph).


[PRO’s]

Other than the cons, I am happy with our purchase of a 2017 Subaru Forester.   I like the various features.

The CVT transmission seems to get the job done just fine. I’m told it may even contribute to the decent milage we are experiencing.

On mileage, we seem to be doing well over twenty-five, which is several miles to a gallon better than our 01 six cylinder Accord.

One of the first things I noticed was how nice and sharp the Forester turns.  I haven’t tested its limits, but it feels you could nearly turn around on an old two lane road.

I like that I don’t have to grope around under the car for the oil filter.

Acceleration with the four cylinder is impressive.  My formerly owned, five speed, four cylinder, 98 Accord hopped right along.  Even with four adults in it and running up a mountain pass.  The Forester feels as if it could compete, for the most part.

The car seems to do pretty well grabbing what traction it can on ice or compact snow.  When my little pickup wants to take a block to get up to steam, the Subaru just squats down and goes on the same roadway, though it does it’s share of slipping too.  Something other than factory provided tires, true winter tires, would go a long ways to changing that.


[CON’s]

The cons are the not so well thought out details, such as the spare tire and the USB access to the radio.

First, the USB port.  Who thinks it was a good idea to put the USB port to the radio inside and at the bottom of the six by six square, ten inch deep console?  Needless to say, trying to plug a flash drive into the port and drive the car is not a good combination.

Second, there is the matter of AWD, a pretend spare tire and no choice in the matter.  Obviously, it’s a good practice to keep all four tires the same size.  This keeps the front from turning at a different speed than the back, which can not just trash milage, but can also trash transmissions.

A good tire rotation pattern includes the spare.  That way, all tires are the same diameter.  If you have a blow out, you can go to the spare.  As it is, you may have to consider purchasing at least two, if not four tires, when one goes.

I didn’t pay total attention to the details and didn’t catch that the radio lacks rear speakers.  I WILL remedy that, because the sound quality from the current system is what it is - barely stereo.  This is not to say the system is not quality for what it is.

As others pointed out, the warranty could be better.

[JUST FOR REFERENCE]

Our previous ride, an 01 Accord, had a lot of trunk space.  In fact, until we put the Forester’s seats down, we could get about three times as much in its trunk.",pos

"this is a great car,  I have 1 complain so far very miner and it is the front cup holder. I use a 30 oz. s.s. tumbler with a handle on it , turns over in cup holder, but if that all I have got to complain then this is a great car.

Year after owning this car it is still a great car.  It may have 8700 miles on it.",pos
"I'm 6'6"", more room than my Cadillac! Easy to get in and out of,  love the adaptive cruise control, and visibility.",pos
"I've had the '17 Forester XT Touring for around 5 months and averaged 1k miles for each of those months--mostly commuting to/from work, but I've also taken the Forester on a road trip through the Appalachian mountains. The twin turbo in the XT adds a lot of pep and the suspension and AWD handle corners with confidence. As far as complaints go, the thicker glass and increased insulation around the doors helps cut down on road/wind noise that many complained about in prior year models, but it's still fairly noticeable on the highway. Not a major issue for me, especially not with the radio on. All-in-all the car has been comfortable, reliable, and fun to drive.
—————————-
20k mile update: I’m still enjoying the car. No mechanical or reliability issues whatsoever. It’s taken me through winter snowstorms in PA and VA and through plenty of stop-and-go traffic in the city. Sad to see there won’t be any official CarPlay/AA retrofitting options, but that’s probably my biggest gripe. Now that Subaru dropped the XT from their lineup, I’ll be holding onto this one for a long time.",pos
had car 3 weeks - car appears very good -  how can anybody give honest evaluation is this period of time,pos
"It may be an ideal SUV for a small family, but it also fits well for us senior citizens. Easy to park; great visibility; easy to enter and exit - just the right height for that. Very quiet and smooth riding for a small vehicle. Engine and CVT transmission seem perfectly mated for this vehicle. Oh, the best part is amazing gas mileage for an AWD - got 30 mpg out of my first tank for city/hwy combined! What' s not to love!",pos
"Do your due diligence.  You can save much. Shop very carefully..  Not a review, just a practical observation. By the way, the Forester is just great! Totally useful, fun and well designed. Does3 everything well.",pos
"Mostly my review is positive. I have one of the higher-end trim packages of the Subaru Forester, and, it is my first SUV as well as first Subaru. I'd love to see better climate control for the back seat people (they must rely on the front seat AC/heat vents to eventually reach them). There are limited amounts of cupholders, and the front two in the middle console are ok, but they are front to back with each other and the back one requires moving the armrest backward to a position where it's not really much use. I suppose the mileage is good for a car this size (I've only had it a month, and I'm averaging 25 MPG). But, coming from a Prius C prior to this, and having 50-54 MPG regularly, this is a bit hard to take. (Deep breaths, it will be ok). The safety features at this point in my life are more important than MPG. I am loving the ""Eyesight Technology""! I love sitting up high and feeling a larger presence on the road. Love the steering responsive headlights, and the backup camera is awesome. It's a smooth ride, and a good looking car. It did have a complicated electrical/computer problem the 2nd day that I owned it, so back it went to the dealer for three days. All seems to be well now, after a special technician was called to make an appearance to come to the computer's rescue. It's only been a month, so I cannot speak to the repair cost issue, nor to the reliability of the car, which I will know as time goes on.",pos
"the climate feature is wonderful  never knew how much I was fiddling  with it to be comfortable,  visibility very good, drives  and rides really really nice,",pos
the dealer adjusted the head rest. Car is still problem free with great mileage,pos
"Only have for two weeks but car rides a lot smoother and quieter than expected. Great pickup. Fit and finish very good. Expected simple and utilitarian controls and info system and have it. Meets all my needs. Cons so far are few; wipers/lights not synchronized, doors don't lock automatically when car gets going, no glovebox light, needs room to put in 3 car seats. Very good overall SUV.",pos
"I've driven the wheels off this car in the last month, 2 semi-long road trips for family events. I thought about keeping it parked but it's such a nice drive on the highway, I couldn't imagine leaving it in the driveway. This is my first SUV or crossover, I'm coming from a 2011 Mazda 3 5-speed, so I was a bit nervous about the transition to CVT. The shifting is taking time to get used to, but she will get up and go when I need it. The RPMs are usually low when I look, ~2k cruising but up to 6k if pushing it extra hard. The take-off is lacking but I knew that when I weighed the cost of ownership for the turbo; that said, she'll do what you need her to do. The noise is very low this year and it's noticeably so. I listen to audio books which can sometimes be difficult when doing 70mph. The interior is relaxing overall. The visibility makes me less nervous about driving such a big thing and the controls are easy. The navigation is absolutely fantastic and the bluetooth has worked flawlessly. The headlights that turn with the steering wheel are AMAZING for country driving and has helped me see deer in the road. The automatic cruise control and break assist is equally as fantastic. I can honestly say that the break assist may have saved me from rear ending someone already! Within the first week! The car behind me pulled to the side it happened so very quickly! The ONLY con I have really is the automatic headlights. These things make no sense and basically do whatever the heck they want. If you have automatic headlights turned on, you cant override and turn on the brights without holding the stick back. Seriously, WTH!? When I'm coming down by suburban street late at night, I like to watch for my neighbors cats and such but can't turn the brights on without either turning the headlights to manual or holding the stick.",pos
"This is the best car for the money, safety, features, fuel economy, and price.",pos
"I have about 10,500 miles on my 2017 Subaru Forester. No, I do not drive a lot but love this vehicle every time I am behind the wheel! After 18 months, the car maintains a high mark (from me) overall. My fuel mileage has never hit the high Subaru claims but I am happy with an average of 29 mpg overall. I live in FL and use the a/c most of the time and I have been told I am an aggressive driver.  The car is great and within the price range is a winner hands down. Eyesight is awesome and I will never own another car without this feature. There is cabin noise; mainly some transmission sounds; not distracting but it does exist. The seats are firm. If one thing could be changed I would ask for 'cushier' front seats. The usb ports are handy but will not charge my phone. I chose Subaru because of safety ratings and the excellent performance of the 'eyesight' option. I changed from a sport sedan to a SUV for comfort and a higher ride with better visibility. This car has provided everything I thought I wanted plus more for this size vehicle and price range.",pos
"Overall, l love the car. The handling, the active driving safety features, the gas mileage, the ride, ...   Would be nice if there are more pocket/compartment for storage. And the car come with so many control/info features, it would take sometime to get to know and use.",pos
"Let me start with saying that I’m a Mazda guy. I owned 8 Mazda in 15 year period. My wife drives 2016 CX-5 GT model and we love that car. I had 2011 CX-9 GT with to many miles, so it was a time to get a new car. Went to Mazda to see what I can get for cheap, like $250-$300 per month lease. Liked the new 2017 CX-9, but it was to expensive. Then my brother told me that Subaru has cheap lease specials. Same day went to see what will I like. I liked the Outback but it was to slow with 2.5i engine option. Outback is much heavier then Forester. So I end it up leasing 2017 Forester because the cheap lease special ($250 per month tax included.  $400 down) and the way it drives. This is my second Subaru. The first was 2007 Impresa 2.5i. I loved that car. Drove 95K miles with zero problems, that’s why I decided to get Forester. So far I’m very satisfied. Good acceleration, good MPG for AWD, very comfortable seats. AWD is a big plus. Good handling, very nice and quiet ride.  I love all the safety futures, lane assistance, blind spot monitor and break assist. New entertainment system is awesome; 7” touch screen is very easy to use. Backup camera is OK, low quality when it’s dark. The only concern I have is the towing capacity only 1500lb. I have a trailer with 3 dirt bikes on it. Total weight is 1400lb, so I should be OK I hope))) I drove both 2016 and 2017 Forester. 2017 has a better CVT transition (more responsive), less road/wind noise, better interior and looks meaner))). Over all I enjoy driving this car.",pos
"I bought a 2017 Forester to replace my 2006 model.  The new one is a pleasure to drive.  The driver's seat and steering wheel can be adjusted in more ways, the interior is quieter, and the sound system is better.  My only complaint is that the right-rear blind spot is bad.  The rear-seat headrest on that side blocks the  view out of that corner.  Overall, I love the car.",pos
"It was an exhaustive search.  It boiled down to a Forester, Jeep Cherokee, or Mazda CX-5.  All wheel drive is an extra option on both the Mazda and the Jeep. The jeep was out first based on cost with options and the extremely poor reliability rating at Consumer Reports.  The Mazda drove like a sports car, but the cost added up fast with options and I didn't like not being able to get heated mirrors unless you stepped up to the top of the line trim level which put you in the low 30k cost area and added options I didn't want.  The Mazda had a lot of great electronics, but lets face it, in 5 years they are all going to be like like in-dash VCRs.  The Mazda's reliability rating was way below the Subaru, the Mazda was harder to see out of, and since the only traction tests I saw on line were Mazda productions and the only thing they highlighted on was acceleration on a snowy hill from a dead stop and the wheels always turned to the right, I was skeptic about the drive system as well.  That and in the test the Subaru driver always seem to be pushing the accelerator hard to make a slip.  The only test I would believe is if they chained them both together on a snowy field and did a tug-of-war.  I went with the Subaru since I wasn't in the market for a sports car and needed something that would deal well with a Minnesota winter.  I got what I wanted for 26k, a time proven all wheel drive system, heated seats, heated mirrors, rear defrost and wiper, and easy to see out of when snow clouds your view and it comes standard with a nice power moonroof which was an extra option on the Mazda.  I still have bluetooth, sat radio, and a bunch of entertainment features I don't even care about.",pos
"This is the first Subaru that I have owned.  I was looking for a small SUV and I had done a lot of research on them and I was impressed with the Forester.  I have had the Forester for almost a month and her are of my observations:  Ride: Smooth, quiet and stable;  Acceleration: Quick, better than expected;  Instrumentation:  Excellent;  Interior quality:  Excellent;  Visibility:  Excellent with huge windshield and large windows all around;  Sunroof:  Largest I've ever seen;  Car quality:  solid as a rock;  Safety:  There isn't a safer car on the road;  Seating comfort and space:  Excellent;  Cargo capacity:  Copious;  Gas   Mileage:  I averaged 33MPG for the first 1000 miles.  The Forester is not as swoopy looking as some of its competition but is still a handsome well built compact wagon like utility vehicle.",pos
"I purchased a 2016 Forester Limited 2.5i new last year, but upgraded to the 2017 with eyesight, and what a difference!  The 2017 Forester is noticeably quieter, there are now lights on the vanity mirrors...it's a girl thing!  The eyesight package is amazing, I just love having all that safety technology, especially with all the distracted drivers on the roads.  The peace of mind of the SOS button and road side assistance is a blessing.  The steering wheel tracking headlights are so cool!  There is a redesigned rear view mirror that is easier to use, with a larger viewing area, love that!  The upgraded stereo system is noticeably superior!  The trade in process was easy and fair.  Love love love it!!!",pos
"Great driver 360 visibility, but it is improved when removing rear headrests when not in use.",pos
"Everything within easy reach from drivers seat, very logically designed,  intuitive, but the throttle is too sensitive.  It accelerates faster than I would like when I depress the gas pedal.  It is especially disconcerting at low speeds.",pos
"After much research I determined that the 2017 Forester was going to be the SUV for me.  And I haven't been disappointed...granted I've only had it 2 and half days.  The stories, reviews and forum posts were more than enough to help me make my choice.  This is not only my first Subaru but is also my first new vehicle.  I have to say that the package I picked (2.0XT Touring in Sepia Bronze Metallic w/Saddle Brown leather interior) is stunning!...inside and out.  The LED headlights are beautifully done.  It is gorgeous!  You WILL get noticed.  It took about 30 minutes for the guy at the dealership to show me all the features.  Acceleration is fantastic for an SUV...and I haven't even been able to test out the turbo yet.  First impressions with how it handles on the open road and curvy hills were I live were impressive...for an SUV.  I read reviews on earlier models about comfort issues in the front seats.  I feel that they are more than adequate in the comfort department on the 2017...remember, this not a sports car.  The leather really helps with the comfort factor, IMO.  One of my favorite features is the visual display you receive with the large, over-sized sun roof coupled with the large windows.  Interior controls don't include anything fancy, but again are more than adequate and reasonable.  The 7"" touch-screen display seems easy to use and is user friendly.  I have not had any problems with Bluetooth with the few calls I've made so far.  I could go on with this review but the bottom line is I'm very please with my purchase.  And I don't mind the looks I get when driving down the highway either.",pos
"I have been in the market for a small SUV for a while now.  I have driven all of the major players - CR-V, CX-5 and the Forester. I am a long-time Honda person.  I liked the CX-5 but it was a bit more cramped inside and the visibility was not as good.  The CR-V drove well and had the best CVT behavior but just left me a bit uninspired due to its bland nature.  I drove the 2016 Forester and liked it - I have two other family members with Foresters who love them.  I found out the 2017 model with a mild refresh was on its way so I waited until they took the first one off the truck at my local dealership (Cannon Subaru in Lakeland is great!).  I test drove the 2017 back to back with a 2016 they still had on the lot and the difference was significant as far as solidity, smooth ride and much quieter ride.  The new infotainment system was intuitive and easy to use with volume and tuning KNOBS along with a touch screen - compared to the the CR-V's system (a disaster of confusing touch screen with no knob controls!) and the CX-5 which had the frustrating center toggle knob - the Subaru system is much better. The sound quality of the non-upgraded stereo is adequate - meets or exceeds the others in this category.  The Forester drives very smoothly and has a solid, quality feel inside and out.  The AWD system provides an extra level of stability to the handling.  The only small issue is the CVT.  Subaru has tweaked the CVT for the 2017 model to attempt to smooth its operation and it is better but still takes some adjustment - this is my first CVT equipped automobile - it is just a different feel and takes adjusting how you drive to a more easy application of the accelerator which gives smooth, linear acceleration (and surprisingly fast!) but driving aggressively with lots of slamming the pedal down - like I was used to doing with the normal automatic equipped small Honda engine automobiles - results in a much worse driving experience with the CVT - I am adjusting and think I'll enjoy the smoothness once I drive a while.  If you have never owned a CVT vehicle, I suggest a good test drive to see if you like it - although, your choices are becoming slimmer as most of the major manufacturers are switching to the CVT for its MPG advantages as they attempt to meet the new government requirements.  Overall, I would highly suggest you put the 2017 Subaru Forester on your list if you are looking for a solid, reliable, safe small SUV.

***UPDATE...been driving my Forester now for about 6 months...overall the car is good but one glaring thing has come to light....the powertrain is dismal after a while...the CVT shudders and hesitates at odd times and just is not smooth no matter what you do.  I have not been able to adjust to it to drive smoothly....there is a surge when you begin acceleration and then the ""fake"" shift points kick in...they are not well timed.  And the incredibly ANNOYING shudder that happens as if the CVT belt is slipping...it happens at different speeds and even when cruising on the highway.  I've mentioned it to my dealer and they say others have complained with the 2017 but not really any explanation.  My advice, take this car on a long test drive and really pay attention to the CVT behavior - especially in low speed driving conditions - it will only get worse once you buy it and drive it....other than that, the car handles well and is comfortable and practical but if you are picky about smooth driving, skip this one.

***Update 2:  After much research and chats on online forums for the Forester, I finally spotted a post about the shuddering CVT issue and the fix that one owner got at his dealership - It was a recently released TSB software update from Subaru - I printed a copy with the TSB number and took it to my dealer and asked to have the update done to my Forester - they did it and the shuddering is GONE - simple fix.  I test drove a 2018 out of curiosity and it did not shudder so it appears Subaru has fixed the issue but if you have a 2017 model that shudders, demand to have the software update #11-175-17",pos
"I'm pushing 70 and have owned many, many vehicles in my life.  I have another SUV and a nice sports car, but I wanted something for snowy days that didn't cost much to own and operate and was reliable.  I have about 20k miles on this 2016 now and am very happy with the purchase.  It was the best value available.   I was a little concerned about the oil burning issues of the previous three years, but this one doesn't use a drop of oil.  Likewise, I didn't know what to expect from the CVT, but it is just fine.  It just doesn't sound like other cars when accelerating.  Also, when we first test drove the vehicle, I thought the seats were too bouncy, but I've come to like them, and I find they are very comfortable on long trips.  The back has plenty of cargo space and the windows are like driving around in a greenhouse.  The visibility is something you need to experience to know what you are missing in other vehicles.  You will need to get them tinted, especially if you live in a sunny location.  There are just a very few things I don't care for or that could be improved.  The sheet metal is really thin, but so were all of the competitors.  The paint shows a few chips, but the vehicle is white and the touch up paint blends in well.  I wish the doors would automatically lock.  I can't figure out why the Subaru engineers don't do this.  It wouldn't cost a thing and it would improve safety.  The accelerator is a little sensitive.  I suspect the engineers wanted to give the illusion of being peppy.  It is not needed.  The radio is OK, but I don't use any of the tech.  Lastly, I don't care for the Subaru dog commercials.  I know they sell cars, but I wish they would just focus on letting people know what a good value these vehicles are.  I intend to keep this one a long time, so I installed some of the plastic door protectors and a rear bumper guard.  The only other extras this vehicle has are alloy wheels and the roof rack.  The vehicle is just perfect for us.",pos
"It is a little early to rate this Forester but it is a huge upgrade from my 2004 model. I am hoping that the interior is more durable than my other one. The cloth/vinyl combo may split. I will see if they improved. I also looked at the Nissan Rogue and Toyota Rav4. If visibility matters, the Forester has it all over these other SUVs. However, I like the material of the seats in the Rogue more. The back up camera in the 2016 Forester is much better than the 15's. It has a larger area for hauling than the other models too without getting into a bigger sized SUV.",pos
"Well to base my past experience, I have owned a 1992 pontiac grand prix from 2000-2002, a 1999 caviler from 2002-2006, a 2004 mitsibishi outlander from 2006-2007, and a 2007 Nissan Sentra from 2007 to currently. And this Forester, which I bought new in Feb. 2016.. I always felt unsatisfied by my vehicles, and I always had buyers remorse. The Nissan was a good car, great gas mileage, affordable but this Forester gets as good or better gas mileage but has 250 HP to really ZOOM through traffic! I just drove 4 hours each way to Minneapolis from Fargo, ND going 78-95 and got 32 mpg average, but the car is rated 23-28. How cool is that? That happens all the time. I consistently get over thirty MPG in this car. The visibility on the 2016 forester is just amazing, the windows are so big and getting into anything like a kia sportage or a ford edge makes me feel claustrophobic now. The car is very easy and smooth to handle. If you want a mid-line SUV, i agree some interiors look a little better, some exteriors look better (the 2016 Mazda looks way better than the forester and I would even say steering is better) but if you get a Turbo Forester it is just kicking! Some things I do not like about the car are that the seats are uncomfortable on drives past 3 hours, the rear seats are not perfectly flush with 'trunk' space when folded down, so you lose some loading ability with that and it seems like something they should have been able to solve easily, the brakes are OK but my sentra's were much better, the steering is almost too smooth and sensitive, there is no play and no feedback so that can be dangerous at high speeds or fast turning, the interior materials are OK - seats and dash are good, paneling on doors is total crap. Speakers were so [non-permissible content removed] it was unbelievable - I swapped speakers and the ones they hid behind the door furnishings were cardboard pieces of junk! No wonder they hid them, and they are super small. Plus radio that comes with has only 30 watt output... pathetic. Last, the rear light is the size of a zippo lighter. Why? Hondas have ten lights on each side going all the way up. I often come home after dark and you can't see anything back there - the light is only 8"" from the floor too so its easily obstructed. Thank goodness for the lights on phones now. Oh well. Every time I get in this thing I feel like i floating along the road bc the visibility and smooth ride is so nice, and unless a camero or porche pulls up you can probably zoom right past whoever is next to you! And get 32 mpg doing it! WOW!",pos
"We bought the 2016 Forester base model with 6 speed for the great vision out of the interior, interior space and manual trans. No other small SUV offers all that. We went to the San Francisco car show and sat in every single offering in this segment. They all were very nice vehicles but it came clear real quickly that many were lacking for what we wanted. neither my wife or I like sitting in a ""pod"" with a tall and full length console beside us. It feels inhibiting and makes the interior seem much smaller than it is. The Subaru was the clear winner here as it is very welcoming and plenty of room with a much lower console area. Their is a significant larger amount of glass and the view out the rear is superior. The CRV and Escape were awful for the rear/side view. The RAV has an odd stadium seating setup which combined with the sunroof makes for inhibited view from the rear. We also enjoyed that the base model Forester did NOT have a sunroof....which takes away headroom and again tightens interior dimensions. Last we wanted a manual trans. We both enjoy them and believe we are more engaged as drivers when using one. Indeed the Forster is the only one offering a manual save Mazda (If I remember correctly). After over a year of owning the Forster it has lived up to all our needs and it was less expensive when comparing like for like AWD small SUV's. Update: 2 years in its still the perfect choice for us!",pos
Have the XT and it is worth the money. Plenty of power and the driving settings are very fun. Have been in really deep snow and never got stuck. Lots of cabin space and leg room front and back. Love the CVT transmission. It's as smooth as can be. Eyesight works well and is very nice in traffic. Heated seats are great. Sunroof is huge. The navigation system needs to be improved. I also don't understand why the rear does not get its own set of air vents. Highly recommend​ this car.,pos
"We bought our 2016 Crystal Black Silica Forester LTD in January of 2016.   We had not looked at a Forester as we deemed it too much of a ""Family"" car.  One that Men don't usually drive!  (Sorry!)    But having reached the end of our ropes with other makes and models with one short-coming or another, we decided, OK, the Forester is EVERYWHERE, there MUST be a reason.  Well yeah there is! It is one great car and so much like my old 2003 Jeep Wrangler with utilitarian ways but OH SO stylish and elegant as well and the Harmon-Kardon 440a sound system rocks!      This ride is one great ride and the quality (at every glance and every turn I find another little special detail!)  is totally off the map. They didn't miss anything.   We love it and we'll probably buy another.   It's so much better than my 1984 Subaru 4x4 Turbo wagon!  That thing was a story in itself!  It was awful.  But, 32 years is a long time to hold a grudge.   The testament to Subaru is that we went back for more!   This car is one great car.   The moon-roof is one of the biggest in the business.  HUGE!    :)",pos

"I've been driving my Subaru Forester for almost a year now.          Pros: Safety is huge - my work responds to accident scenes and I've seen a survival in this vehicle I wouldn't expect in others.  I loved the way it drove in the snow last winter, it gripped the road while others were skidding out all around me.  I was able to drive through a foot of unplowed snow uphill! The back seat has enough leg room for my babies (who are each 6 feet tall).  The gas mileage is great, visibility is great and I love the huge sunroof.     Cons: The new touch screen has issues.  Once in a while it won't work unless I turn the car off and turn it back on.  Sometimes my phone isn't recognized by the bluetooth.  I wish there was moor light in the rear cargo area.  There's a strange pause when I shift gears.  It feels questionable when I take corners faster than I should.  Overall, I'm happy.",pos
"It would be nice if reviewers stated what kind of driver they are and what expectations they had going into this.  For these purposes, I'm a fairly laid back driver.  I drive about 5mph over the speed limit, under limit when conditions are poor, and just like to enjoy the ride.  I'm short (5'6"").  I'm not a road warrior, don't  weave in and out and use my directional.   In terms of expectations it's how I get from one place to another.  No expectations about style or performance.  I'm an advocate from a ""keep it simple stupid"" school.  I do expect to be able to drive capably and safely on the highways, about 80% of the time.  I need it to be my ""go to"" car for my passions , hiking and skiing.   It must be competent on forest roads, logging roads, unmaintained roads, generally what I call ""soft roading"".  It must be capable of handling deep snow, icy, slushy and cruddy roads in the depths of the winter.  It must be capable of hauling all my trail maintenance tools (I volunteer with the US Forest Service).  It must be capable of jamming my skis and gear into it.  It must be comfortable to drive in the depth of the winter colds.  That means heated seats and a good defroster.  It must be able to navigate through heavy snow, which means fog lights.  It must be able to drive through 8"" of mud on dirt roads in the spring.   It must have enough driver's visibility to peer over the heights of land on old forest roads.  It must be ""maximum man, minimum machine"".  It means being close to nature, with great visibility and terrific sun roof, all year.    It means great fuel economy and lower maintenance costs.  It means the longevity of 200K miles or 10 years.   I came from an Audi Quattro with far too many gadgets and features.  Very capable in the winter, with AWD and snow tires.  Problem is, something is always breaking and each repair is costly.  Problem is too low a ground clearance, too great fuel (and oil) consumption.   My first and last  Subaru was a 1981 GL with real 4WD, up/low.   I've taken the Forester down the forest roads, used the Xmode and been quite pleased with how it handles the steeps.   I love being able to put the seat up as high as I can and seeing great distances.  This is very helpful not just on dirt roads, but in seeing wildlife and anticipating the terrain ahead.  I'm no longer fearful of road construction portrudences.  I'm quite fine with CVT.  It's worked quite well under all conditions.   I can't wait to get it in the snow in three months.   It's a car I don't mind getting dirty.   I'm an empty nester, usually hauling only myself around with my gear.  Sometimes one other person.  I would not consider this as a family car.  I'd be looking at an Outback or something else.  While I love Jeeps, I have no need for a larger engine or towing capacity or lower reliability.   Didn't care for the RAV4, CR5 or other competitors for one reason or another.  For me, the non negotiables were sun roof, heated seats.   I don't understand the whining about the rubber mats is all about.  I put dirt-laden picks, axes, saws and other tools in back.  I'm always tracking gravel, dirt, mud and snow into the car.  They are just fine.   If you want a city car with lots of luxury, there are plenty of choices for you.  Just go for the LandRover if that's your style.  I could care less about passenger seat adjustments or a lighted vanity mirror.   What don't Iike?  Mostly small things like more storage compartments, a better stereo (I wil change that out some day), more trunk lighting (I can fix that myself) and a full size spare tire.)  I'm glad it has the roof racks for hauling things like a canoe.  I like the rear spoiler, but it makes putting a bike rack on the back near impossible.    I love the ground clearance.    I love that it's pretty narrow, which makes city driving and parking a breeze.  BTW , I disabled all those beeps and light flashes when the car is locked and unlocked.  No need to draw attention to myself.  I've noticed that trying to stream music via bluetooth in the car results in poor audio fidelity.  Connecting it by wire give much better sound.  For the record, I get 34mpg on trips if I keep it at 60mph.  At 70mph, the mileage gets down to 28, which is about my city driving average.  I've got my snow tires and am ready to rock.  Until then, I'll be on forest roads and highways.",pos
"We have had this Forester for 20 months and have driven it about 18,500 miles. We have the base model with a 6 speed manual transmission.  Adequate acceleration.  Decent gas mileage in the city and highway.  We are averaging about 27-29 mpg. Comfortable and smooth ride.  Very good visibility - much better than the Hyundai Tucson we previously owned.  It is great in the snow - we survived our first winter with it in Edmonton, Canada (we moved here from Colorado Springs, CO). The only very minor complaints we have are the dim lights in the storage area behind the back seats (seems to be a common problem with SUV's), the climate control knobs need to have better contrast to know which setting you are on and the bluetooth when paired with our Android and Apply phones is sometimes a bit spotty.  But these are minor irritants at most. We love this SUV.  It is our first Subaru.  We will definitely look for another Subaru when the time comes to purchase another vehicle.",pos
"Although this car spends over 90% of the time on well-maintained roads, I got it for its ability to handle dirt roads, so-so trails, and times I need decent ground clearance (like our annual trips to the snow). What brought me to the Subaru Forester from the Nissan XTerra and other vehicles with better off-road competence were its 1) lower price, 2) better fuel economy, 3) better seating comfort, and 4) better handing on regular streets and highways. Outward visibility is excellent. I can drive through traffic without having to lean from side to side to check my blind spots. On highway trips I get around 34 mpg with a full load, and on my daily drive of 80% highway and 20% regular streets by myself I get about 30 mpg. I used at have a 2009 Subaru Outback but did not keep it because my then 11-year old daughter found the rear seat legroom insufficient, but on our recent road trip she and her now 10-year old sister had plenty of leg room in the Forester. Both are about 5'4"" tall, and I'm 6'2"". Cargo room is decent for the vehicle size. The biggest compromise I had to make to enjoy all these benefits is the slow acceleration. When passing slower vehicles on our recent road trip, the vehicle was less than inspiring (especially when going uphill). The engine revved loudly but the CVT didn't give me much confidence I was going to get enough oomph to pass quickly enough to avoid oncoming traffic. Needless to say, we survived. Subaru gave $250 to the National Parks Foundation when we leased our car, and that was a nice touch (as was the microfiber Subaru pullover shirt they sent us a couple months later).",pos
"We wound up getting the special edition 2017 Subaru Forester XT turbo. We LOVE the vehicle. Its fast, reliable, looks great and my wife is in  love with her new truck. I have the 2006 WRX which I love. We are happy to be a Subaru family!!",pos
"I have wanted a Subaru Forester since they first came out. But every time we went looking for a new car, a different dealer was willing to give us a better price, or different make of car came with more bells and whistles or better fuel economy. But this time we got the Forester and are very pleased that we did. We have an excellent view or the road, we feel safe, the car corners and handles quite well -- albeit not like a roadster -- the trim level has the features we wanted but not features we didn't want, and at least so far, fuel economy is better than advertised. Be warned, however, that you will find what you are looking for in the owner's manual only by accident.",pos
"We've owned the car now for 18 months, have put 30,000 miles on it, and are very satisfied overall. It is comfortable, with 1 exception... the seat belt tends to be too tight around the shoulder/neck area. I've  dealt with that by placing a small clip that works like a clothespin on the upper part of the belt (above my shoulder). This prevents the belt from being retracted so tight at the shoulder that it is uncomfortable. The car has nice features and an almost reasonable price compared to other new vehicles in its class... of course, they're all overpriced. Sure would like to see a warranty that matches the claims of reliability, like a 5 year 60,000 mile bumper to bumper. Our warranty will be finished by the time we've owned the car for 2 years because of the mileage. So far we like the car, its features, and the way it handled in snow over 2 winters.",pos

"This is my first Subaru purchase which was encouraged by rave reviews of other Subaru owners. I love my Forester and look forward to many safe, comfortable, eco-friendly miles ahead.",pos
"Did tons of research before buying a new car.  Since cars are so expensive wanted one that would last long and was reliable. In the end it came down to Toyota, Honda and Subaru.  All are very reliable. Subaru has the best resale value. Was set on a crosstrek when I decided to test drive a Forester. Three things made my choice.  The incredible vision, no other car I drove came close, the added power, and the ample room to carry cargo.  Also the back seats are roomy and actually recline a bit. I'm 6' and feel comfortable in the back seats.  I like prefer the styling on the forester because similar cars that look sportier have roofs that slope down cutting down on storage and visibility. I down do rock crawling but I like to drive into the mountains to take photos, this car can go almost anywhere. Service roads and trails are no problem. I opted for the turbo for the added power for freeway driving, also comes with almost everything, only option is eyesight.  Subarus trailer hitch is great but expensive. I didn't buy a forester to race around I bought because of practicality and reliability, that being said I love driving it. While many cars corner better, this car can handle swerves and avoidance maneuvers better than anything I have test driven or owned, the AWD is amazing.",pos
"We are recent empty nesters, and my wife wanted to downsize from her Honda Odyssey.   We really liked the Odyssey, but at 170,000 miles and 14 years, my wife started to doubt its durability.  I think it was more perception than reality, but if you feel nervous driving your ride and you can afford a new one, its time to upgrade.  We test ""sitted"" many of the competitors in the small SUV/CUV segment, and my wife was attracted to the Forester for its 1) outward visibility, 2) Subaru Eyesight, 3) practicability, 4) no-nonsense styling, 5) durability, and 6) ruggedness.  What is up with other brands using tiny windows?  I guess Gen X and Gen Y likes to hide under hoodies and baseball caps.  Maybe they should just cover their eyes with their hands.  The Forester was the only vehicle that she didn't feel as though she was looking out of a cave.  My wife is a blue jeans/track shoes type of gal (she doesn't buy or use makeup!), and the Subaru brand image fits her perfectly.   Subaru Eyesight clinched the deal for us.  It is driver assistance technology that includes lane departure, forward collision warning, emergency braking, and adaptive cruse control.  Its pricing was very reasonable and did not require expensive and unwanted upgrades.  Because we are entering our senior years, we felt that these driver aids will come in handy over the coming years.  We wish that it also had blind spot monitoring.  However, the windows on the Forester are really large, so you don't really need it.   I'm a mild car enthusiast and had my doubts about the CVT transmission, but it works pretty well with the engine.  There is a little lag with hard acceleration from a stop, and you may think twice about passing a car at 50 mph, but it really is not noticeable in puttering around town or shleping along the interstate.  After all, you don't buy a Forester to drag race.   We have only owned it for 2,000 miles, but so far so good: no discernible defects or issues.  How about me?  Well, being ancient, I wanted really comfortable seats, like the zero gravity seats in the Nissan Murano.  They are a dream.  The Forester seats are comfortable, but not stellar. I would pay more for better seats.  Also, the ride could be more compliant.  The suspension is a little stiff.  Maybe it will soften a bit with more miles. When driving over expansion joints on the highway, there can be a bucking motion that is particularly noticeable for back seat passengers.  How about technology?   The infotainment screen could be better, but it is acceptable, unless you get your undies in a knot over anything less than iPod ease of use.    Come on people.  You have a really blessed life if your biggest complaint is hitting the correct station on your touch screen.  In summary, we love our Subaru.  I hope we don't become those tedious Subaru zombies who rattle on about how great their car is, but I may have gotten the virus.  With a little luck, my Subaru will see me out!",pos
"This is a great car. I looked at all the competitors. CRV, Rav4, etc. Chose the Forester. Glad I did. Love the handling, in wet and especially snow. Did a lot of haggling and got a great deal. Mileage in town is about 26, in semi rural areas where the speed is slow but there are few stops, mileage is 34-37. Highway is 31. (I drive fairly economically) Passing is good on the highway. The mirror-link for your phone is a real pain in the ass. Love the visibility around the car. Love the cargo capacity. Roof rack is kind of noisy, but use it often. Liking the CVT trans. LOVE the pushbutton start.

Update 8/117. Pretty much the same.  The 4wd is awesome on the winter . The car has developed a rattle under the dash that the dealer can't find (I suspect a loose wiring harness, but who knows) that is irritating on a bumpy road. Mileage is about the same.  Car has so far been reliable. I'd buy another one.",pos

"I am very pleased so far with my 2016 Forester with eyesight, leather, moonroof, navigation and bluetooth. The price was great at $20500 before taxes and fees. The car is comfortable.

I expect it to last me 10 years or more.",pos
The acceleration and handling is excellent. When I drive it it feels very stable and sure around obstacles. It is also surprisingly roomy inside.,pos
"Have had my 2016 Forester for three weeks and about 800 miles. The CVT takes some getting used to , however, the gas mileage is impressive for all wheel drive, given this motor is not broken in yet and I'm getting 27.5 mpg in mixed driving. No rattles, issues or negative  impressions. Considered this vehicle because my wife has the 2012 model and loves it and no issues with her vehicle either. The Subaru dealership was great to work with and I feel I got a very good deal. Time will tell but so far this Forester is proving this was the right choice !!!

Have owned this Forester for six months now and here is my update. Still no issues with anything. Changed the oil at 2000 miles, my choice, and no excessive consumption. Given this is a new vehicle and the motor is  just braking in I'm very happy with it. Highway mileage is around 33 mpg. if I keep the speed under 70 mph. Over 70 and the mpg. drops quickly. At this point I would buy this vehicle again.

Have now owned this vehicle for 13 months and over 7000 miles. No oil consumption issues. In fact, no issues of any kind. Have driven in all weather conditions and the Subaru has been great. Am enjoying the Forester very much and would purchase again.",pos
I was very happily surprised at the enduring quality of this vehicle.,pos
"Great car to drive, very user friendly. Simple, all wheel drive is second to none. I purchased a car from East Hills Subaru my salesman name was James Hoppe, very helpful and understanding. Took the time to show me the car.",pos
"First, please understand I was driving a 2008 KIA Sportage manual shift and was very happy with it, when my wife told me it was time to get a new vehicle. Hey, I don't have to be told twice.

I did a lot of research, and a lot of looking, and the new KIA's did not suit my purposes. I do a lot of kayaking and other outdoor activities. The new KIA's roof rack design was not conducive to carrying sea kayaks, plus they haven't been highly rated.  I also looked at the Toyota RAV-4's, and have experience with the Honda CRV since my wife has one- none seems to be the package I was looking for. 

The more I read, the more I thought the Forester was just what I needed. Not the sportiest vehicle out there, but reputed to be reliable, good gas mileage, good traction, and roomy without being overly big. 

The Forester turns out to be beyond my expectations. The kayaks fit easily, and I haven't noticed any decrease in the MPG with them on top. I have been averaging about 29 MPG on non-highway driving. I love the moon-roof, and the entertainment system is great.  All the usual driving controls are very intuitive. I've heard complaints about acceleration, but I find it peppier than my old Kia- not a problem merging onto the interstate. The car handles nicely on our winding back country roads, and the high clearance was perfect for the dirt ""roads"" in the Adirondacks that I frequent.  It is quieter than my Kia, and the CVT seems to work much smoother than a traditional auto transmission. There is good visibility while driving.

I also read extensively about the oil burning problem reported on older models- this gave me some pause, but after grilling the sales person and service manager, I was assured the problem had been fixed. And so far I haven't used a drop of oil in over 2500 miles. I'll keep an eye on it, all the same.

There are only a few things I would like to see improved. The dashboard material is very hard to keep clean- the pollen and dust stick readily to it. The instrument panel display (speedometer, etc.) are the nice red backlighting (protects your night vision)  when the lights are on, but the sound system is an LED screen, which I find excessively bright at night. Unfortunately there is only one dimmer switch, and when I decrease the brightness to suitable level, I can barely see the speedometer panel.

Another minor annoyance is the design of the door trim. I have long legs, and tend to sit splay legged when I drive, therefore my knee rests against this protruding trim. After an 8 hour drive across the state, I found I had pressure marks.Another adjustment I've had to make is the delay when moving from reverse to drive. Seems to lag a little. It may just be my transition to an automatic from a manual, but I do have to be aware of the change in timing for when I back out onto the road- I need more lead time to keep others from getting perturbed.

 The ""all weather"" mats that come as part of the ""upgrade"" package are quite cheap and ineffective. Subaru should be embarrassed. They would be better off contracting with Weather Tech to make some decent mats- particularly at the sticker price they put on these crappy things.  
The only other ""regret"" I have is the interior color. I got the blue exterior, which is really snazzy, but I didn't pay much attention to the seat color, which is a very light shade. I can see that down the road these are going to get grimed up. I guess you can argue the light color seats will be cooler in the summer- but living in the north, that is not a great benefit. I can't fault Subaru for my choice- just be aware.

Overall, I am very happy with my new Forester, and I expect to be driving it for years to come.",pos
"this is the third subaru in our fam (2nd forester; there was also an impreza).  great gripping, reliability, resale value.  we hope to keep it for the next 15 years.",pos
It's my first Subaru and it's my first brand new car. So far I have driven 1200 miles and its a joy to drive. I am loving this car as I get a better understanding of its various functions. I have not tested it yet in snow or other rough terrain so I can't speak of it. I hope my relationship with my Subaru will go on like this in coming years to come. But overall it's a nice car to drive.,pos
Just drove 230 miles and it was a pleasure.  Very tall family and we all fit very comfortably.,pos
"Great power. Good sound systems. Sleek look. Solid feel. Road hugging. Plenty of storage. Bright head headlights. Good looking wheels. Easy read and sophiscated cluster. 

I am going to sell my BMW and keep this Subaru Forester XT. But this is a well built vehicle. I drove Audi Allroad, BMW X1 and X3 and x4, Toyota Rav 4, Scion Xb, Honda CRV. This is by far, the most well balanced, value and well built vehicle. Don't blindly loyal to Honda and Toyota, imho they just make average vehicle. Anyway want to challenge me, please go to drive the cars yourself and compare, you will know what I am talking about. 

2.5 NA is decent but 2.0XT is great.

Please don't blindly buy Toyota and Honda, their car overrated. Period.",pos
I like everything about this car except that the drivers power seat does not have enough adjustments.,pos
Have seen the adds and after a test drive leased the vehicle. First time leasing will find out if this was a good choice in 36 months. Vehicle has crash avoidance system. I love it. With cruise control activated vehicle will automatically slow when you approach the vehicle on front of you and maintain a safe distance until the vehicle moves and then will accelerate to pre-set speed. No more tapping the brake and re-engaging. Vehicle handles well and has a great sound system. Controls and features are very intuitive.,pos
seems to be a great car for the price - only had it 3 weeks,pos
"The Forester is larger, that is, taller and more spacious feeling up front in the driving area than is the Outback. It also rides higher and feels more like an SUV than does the Outback, which rides more like a station wagon to me. So, it depends on your personal preference. Both cars increase in cost as you go up the TRIM scale. I got the basic model of the Forester. It feels solid, reliable, and safe. Just the kind of vehicle I was looking for and know that I can rely upon for years to come. Very happy with my purchase.",pos
"5k and just like I brought it home, no issues. Was concerned from a lot of blogs on oil use....none in 4k miles until first oil change.",pos
"We finally bought a new Forrester. This was the time, the price was right, and the Forrester has grown up in to a beautiful, functional, and sized-right car perfect for young or old. We love it so far, my wife barely lets me drive it. She is very happy and calls it ""her dream machine"". The visibility is great, the ride comfortable (although the seats could use a little more cushiness), and my only problem is driving in high winds. You feel the weight and excellent traction beneath you, but the car is subject to some windage due to its height. We love the car and our only reservation is that the gas mileage is not as advertised.",pos
"It's very difficult to find another Subaru car/suv on the road or parking lots.  Since we bought the Forester in mid-March, we have counted less than 10 Subaru in the last 3 weeks (not counting the cars in the dealer lots).",pos
With the tall window glass and front door triangle glass  the visibility is unlimited. No more blind spot compare with other competitor  feel safer when driving down the road,pos
"Update: I still do love the car, however the A/C system leaves much to be desired. I often have to crank it up to 3 or 4 in the summer to cool down which is LOUD and still isn’t even that great. If you have it on head / feet mood, it tends to be inadequate. Would be tough for someone living in a really hot or cold climate. 

I absolutely love my new Subaru Forester. I will be driving this car until I just can't drive it anymore. I've been shopping for a crossover SUV for about a month now. I bought my Forester two days ago after much hesitancy. EVERYONE in the state of Oregon drives a Subaru and I didn't want to be just another Subaru driver. Sometimes it's fun to stand out! But now that I've owned one, I totally get the hype. The car handles well, it's fun to drive and so far it has been good on gas. I've done mainly city driving and it's been between 25 - 30 mpg. There are a lot of choices in the world of crossover SUVs, and I feel as though I drove most of them. This one (for me) had the best driving experience and the best value by far. The mid-trim level (Premium) gets you a lot (heated seats, a beautiful moonroof) and I'm happy that I stepped up to it. 

If you're in the throes of crossover suv car selection like I was for a month, give the Forester a try. Some like it, some don't but the quality, value and driving experience are really top notch.

Update: 3/31/17:  The air-conditioning system leaves a bit to be desired. Even if you have it going on full blast it's not really that adequate, especially on a very hot day. The same goes for the heat. I often need to turn on my heated seats, and the heat to stay warm when it's cold out.",pos
"I traded in my 2010 Lexus IS 250 AWD sedan for the sporty 2.0XT Touring Forester and really like it. I did a ton of research on it prior to buying via Internet reviews and YouTube videos. We are mostly Toyota people only because I have never had issues with their vehicles and reliability is hugely important to me. We have a great local dealer in Parker Subaru so I knew I would have a great dealer experience just as I always had at Parker Toyota. The car drives really nicely and I chose the turbo motor because i liked the overall look vs the other trim models and like the zip when I need it- my Lexus had a v6 so this engine is more zippy like my Lexus was. I elected not to add eyesight only because I didn't want to spend anymore on my Forester and decided to get that option on my next Subie as the technology continues to get refined but I got all the other options on my new ride and love the Harmon Kardon stereo upgrade. My wife has a 2015 RAV4 but I have never cared for those even though I'm a big Toyota guy. I still think my new car looks, drives, and just feels more solid than the RAV. I am adding chip repair and also added oil changes to my deal so i won't have to shell out $80 on synthetic oil changes every 5-6k miles on my lease. I chose the Quartz Blue Pearl and absolutely love the color along with the 18"" rims and more aggressive front grill on my trim. I initially was going with a new Honda CRV Touring but glad  I went with the Subaru- it seems like a more stout vehicle for the Northwest roads and weather here in North Idaho. I have a buddy with a 2014 Forester he bought new and it has the Eyesight and he sure loves that feature. He just started selling Subarus over in Seattle and speaks highly of the feature although he is in a bigger city with lots of traffic and I'm not which is also why it wasn't as important to me but wanted to mention it for other shoppers considering adding Eyesight. He couldn't say enough good stuff about why it's a cool feature to have.",pos
"I moved from a 2014 Crosstrek Hybrid to this car.  The MPG is comparable, but it is much roomier.  The head unit and audio is way way better in this model than in my previous Subaru, and the cabin is pretty quiet.  I do have a couple of small complaints:
1.  You cannot mute the audio in the NAV system, and it breaks into the music versus talking over the music.  For me, this makes the NAV system too annoying to be used, and I end up using Google Maps instead.  According to Subaru customer service, this is not something that they are planning on fixing.
2.  The Bluetooth microphone seems to pickup a lot of noise, especially during highway driving.  People on the other end say it is quite annoying to listen to.  I have tried adjusting the mic volume, and it doesn't seem to help much.
3.  The EyeSight cameras remove the area where you can store sunglasses, and make the rear view mirror a little challenging to adjust.  They also should have blind spot available in this like it is in the Outback/Legacy.  
This is our 4th Subaru, and the reliability of the prior 3 has been exceptional.  I expect this will be the same.
All in all, I would definitely recommend this car.  It is our 4th Subaru, and",pos
"Do your homework; both Consumer's Reports annual car review edition and Car and Driver research was helpful.  Also, test drive the competition's products as well;  for us, the Subaru Forester beat all the others when it came to visibility, ease of getting in and out, value, amenities and dealership relations...
Initially thought the CVT transmission might take some getting used to, but, in fact, its so seamless neither my wife or I give it a second thought.  My only pick is that I wish the fuel cap was on the left (driver's side) instead of the right.
Okay, now, after having owned the car for a little over a year, we still think we made the right choice; other then routine oil changes, we have had no issues with the vehicle or the servicing dealership (Hodges Subaru).  In our opinion, the Forester is still a strong recommendation.
We now have about 22,000 miles on the Subi and we are still very happy; the vehicle is still tight and, for its size, the handling is excellent.  However, a small pick... the air bag indicator light on the upper console stays on all the time to show (I guess) that it is functioning;  it's distracting and unnecessary (especially at night)...",pos
Very good car for the money.,pos
"This is my fourth Subaru Forester purchase as I am a devoted Subaru fan.  This purchase I decided to upgrade from the basic Forester model to the next level up and got the Premium model.  After a few weeks of owning it I love all of the safety items such as side air bags, lane departure warning, and obstacle ahead warning.  Wish it had the blind spot sensor, but not a huge deal for me.  The models is definitely quieter  than my 2011 model, and the gas mileage is much improved.  Comfort, handling, and acceleration are still great.  Love this car",pos
"I have spent nearly 100 hours over the past several months reading/watching everything I can about midsize suv's and trucks.    I test drove a number as well. 

I had shyed away from Subaru mostly because I was never a fan of their appearance which is why it took me so long to start researching them and eventually test driving.  

I was blown away at how much you get for the price.  The quality is obvious the minute you see one in person and take it for a drive.  The standard AWD is unbeatable.   

It feels heavy yet has this velvety smooth acceleration that makes you feel one with the pavement.  

The outward appearance is deceiving.  It doesn't look huge but when you step inside its like an entirely different vehicle.  It's extremely roomy inside and the oversized windows open it up even more.    

I test drove a RAV4 with comparable features and it felt like a large Corolla and was way pricier. 

If you're even thinking about a vehicle in this class you need to test drive the Forester.   It'll sell itself.",pos
"I came from a 2007 Honda Civic LX, I looked, and test drove most of the main players.  I tried the CRV, Rogue, Tiguan, CX-5, and the Outlander.  I had it narrowed down to these.  I had previously owned Ford, KIA, and Hyundai products..never down that road again.   They all had their strong points, but after you take all those and combine them, you end up with the Forester.  I love the styling, and the ride.  The only downside is the poor OEM tires.  The Yokohama Geolanders, well they just suck.  Besides the tires, I love the layout and the functionality inside.  I find the seats are comfortable (I've had back surgery).  No excess noises or rattles.  The stereo is nice with the bluetooth connectivity, and the USB ports inside the center console.  If you are looking for a comfortable CUV with a can do attitude, check out the Forester.

**8 month update.  I have 14k miles on it now, loving it even more.

***A year later and no complaints.  Just passed 25k miles.",pos
"Alright guys, I am not one to sugar coat my opinions on vehicles, I'm coming out of a 2006 Pontiac Torrent (wrote a review for that no better than scrap metal vehicle!) let me address the controls first: those that get new vehicles frequently and are up on the newest and hottest in vehicle entertainment systems may find Subaru's some what simplistic design lacking, I have always upgraded my vehicles with touch screen radios etc and the transition wasn't bad coming in to the forester. My advice is to sit and play with the controls for awhile if you're having trouble, once you figure it out I think you will appreciate how easy it is to use while driving. The controls on the wheel did intimidate me for a minute but having the accessibility at my fingertips is nice! And when it comes to setting the clock (saw some frustration on a couple reviews) it's not really that difficult, again, play with your controls while you're sitting in park and you'll figure it out. The manual did suck when explaining these features so I do not recommend trying to figure it out with that. Interior materials: I've seen a few complaints about the interior feeling cheap due to the use of hard plastic materials, to me this makes perfect sense. I am new to the Subaru family but plastic is long lasting and easy to clean, when thinking about Subaru and how their consumers love the off road capabilities it makes sense as to why they used the materials they did. This is not an Audi or a Mercedes, they pretty much think you're going to be rough with it and planned ahead with the materials used. The seats are a bit firm, but they're also new and firmness can be adjusted! I recommend the all weather package if you live anywhere that gets cold, heated seats are an awesome option and since I prefer cloth, not many companies cater to that desire. I saw some mild dissapointment when it comes to the placement of the USB and AUX ports, as I said previously, I usually install new radios on my vehicles so the ports are on the radio, Subaru places theirs in the center console and I actually LOVE that placement as you don't have wires coming out of the front of the vehicle getting tangled in the shifter etc, there are 2 cut outs for the wires so you can safely close the arm rest and still have your phone plugged in. I absolutely love that, but personal preference I suppose. Some reviewers mentioned the fact that the doors do not lock when you put the vehicle in drive, this is not an issue for me as I do not have children and typically only have people over 21 in my vehicle, they should know at that age not to open the doors while the vehicle is in motion but I can see how that could become a mild annoyance to those that have to remember to lock the vehicle every time they drive it so just make note of that if you have children. I have only had this vehicle 24 hours so I cannot comment on reliability, once I've broken it in I will update on that. My package included the first 2 years of scheduled maintenance, which I would recommend as they take synthetic oil and I am told the air filters can also become extremely costly. If you can swing it in your deal, try to get this included. The CVT transmission did take about 10 minutes to get used to and when the vehicle cold starts it is a bit noisey for a vehicle that has a hundred miles on it. Not a deal breaker though. I'm not a big fan of the Aha radio that comes installed on the radio, it seems to take too long to load but then again, I have only played with it once so that opinion may change. So far it drives over potholes, bumps, and other annoying road obstacles like cream cheese on a bagle. I opted to not get the eye sight technology as I thought it may become annoying, the back up camera and (huge) moon roof that come standard are both nice surprises. I'm still figuring out little quirks and haven't yet had the chance to test it in bad weather conditions (although it's snowing now!) and I do plan to take it in to some mild off road conditions so these are all things I will review later in time. I opted for a lease and plan to switch it once my credit is built up a bit, but so far, I do not see any major complaints in the foreseeable future. They also have roadside assistance at no cost to you, which is also a nice feature! Can't wait to update for you guys!",pos
I bought a Premium but it has navigation and alerts for driving over the lanes or too close to the car ahead...Has come in very handy. I don't need leather seats and I don't want he button for the rear lift.,pos
"It is too soon to answer some of these questions such as fuel economy, but my experience so far is good.  I especially like the visibility with full Windows all around and the driver's seat raised.  I wish the passenger seat was also electrically controlled  it is comfortable as is.  I especially liked dealing with the people at Matin CA Suburu/Mazda dealership p.  Straight forward, reasonable price.  No need for dickering.  They didn't push extras .  I drove my car off the showroom floor the first daY went in.
I have returned a few times for more operating instructions  which they gladly give.  I got the security feature Eye Sight.  That and other features made a lot to remember. The price below includes registration, license, tax, $1400 for 3 year maintenance at Suburu, and gap insurance recommended for first few months to insure replacement if my coverage falls a bit short.    ( I have a comprehensive insurance.). Update.  I am not thrilled with mpg, but I am told the reading is not totally accurate the first few months and I am primarily a short distance driver.  Example I drove 11 miles mostly freeway but also in town with three or four stop lights.  The mpg at end of 11 miles was 23.5.  All city driving it is quite a lot lower.  One long freeway drive it got up to 29 mpg.",pos
I was really impressed with the turbo speed and fuel economy,pos
"If you are not into all the new technology that is in cars now you may not be as happy as you thought you would be in a new car. Personally, I enjoyed having things simple and reliable. Turn a knob or flip a switch and it always works the same way. Not so with wi-fi and bluetooth. This ""new stuff"" is not what I wanted, but since I wanted a Forester I had to settle for all their so-called improvements. I guess if keep this one for at least 12 years also I'll get use to these new-fangled features, eventually!",pos
"First of all, I am writing this review keeping in mind its for a CUV and not a sports car.

A traded a 2010 Honda CR-V for my 2016 Forester 2.5i. I also test drove a Honda CR-V, HR-V, and many Subaru models and trims

Since I already own a sporty car, my purpose for buying the Forester was practicality.

My reasons for picking and loving the Forester over other choices:
- Quality of material are superior. The seat fabric feels better and more durable than on the CR-V. The plastic trim feels really nice and is soft-touch in most places. The switch gear (knobs) are very solid. The doors, door panels and seat frame are solid.
- The 2.5 boxer engine and CVT provide much better acceleration than my old CR-V. Its on par with the new CR-V but it handles better.
- Visibility is outstanding. I feel much safer being able to see around me so well 360 degrees. Most CUVs have poorer visibility.
- Subaru AWD is best in class. The OEM tires are mediocre, but that is true of most OEM tires.
- Storage space is excellent - on par with the CR-V.
- Cabin tech is much better than I was used to. I paired both my wife's and my iPhones. You can set it up to automatically connect to either phone when do so manually when the car starts. I use Apple Music and have steering wheel control of Apple Radio, playlists, albums, etc. Pandora integration is also excellent. It all works over BT or over USB - your choice.
- Handling is better than I expected. I drive a very rough, windy road for a few miles each day. The suspension tracks very well and inspires confidence.
- MPG is very good. I used to average 24.5 mpg with my 2010 CR-V. In the first 1000 miles I average 28.5 mpg with the Forester. I expect that to get better after break-in, with warmer weather and summer gas.
- My dealer was great. I asked them if I could get heated seats added to the base model. They took care of getting them installed (after-market). Considering the Subaru's TMV and my trade, they didn't charge me anything for the upgrade.

And a few cons:
- With the base Forester I got manual seats. I wish they were more adjustable.
- Subaru could have provided more storage nooks in the dash

Considering the passenger volume, cargo volume, great CUV mileage, and quality, the Forester is a steal.",pos
"Great price forthe features. Eyesight is a great feature to have. Went for a test drive at Subaru Santa Monica, immediately decided this is the right SUV for my family. My wife and my kids approved it!",pos
"I believe this car is for the person who is focused on having a reliable, functional, simple yet user friendly, safe SUV. If you want a car that will change and powder you, this isn't it. This a car for someone who wants some of the luxuries of what is expected in modern cars but not really super fancy. When I set out to find a new vehicle, I looked for, reliability, power, all terrain capabilities, handling, decent looks, space, economy, and comfort. All of these have been met and surpassed. 
<br><br>
The car looks well built and symmetrical. No weird chattering or shaking, no cheap plastics, no seemingly loose parts, and according to my research on engine and trans, they are bullet proof (figuratively speaking). That's to be expected from Subaru though. 5th on the best quality cars in 2015.
<br><br>
 I was afraid that the 170hp 2.5 Boxer would not be enough for an suv but I have never been more wrong. It has ample power and moves briskly. Its not the turbo version by any means but definitely gets out of its own way and, not that I recommend it but, it has enough power and torque for spirited driving, off-roading, and hills. I've never liked a car that cant react quickly to the throttle, and the throttle response is great. I believe Having power is just as important as good breaks and handling to get out of dangerous situations and the forester has it all. I'm also a manual transmission kind of guy and I went with the CVT because of my Girlfriend and the economy. I'm blown away by the performance of this thing. Die hard, traditionalist, Manual trans folks, it ok to trust the CVT its nothing like the laggy ATX's of the past. 
<br><br>
I have not done much off-road driving but what little I have done, I can hardly tell the difference between tarmac and gravel. This car likes to grip the road and not let go. Im newish to AWD and the level of command this car has on less-that-desirable road conditions is outstanding. Compared to something like the RAV4 this is true AWD and behaves as such.
<br><br>
As stated above the handling is great, you point the steering wheel and there it goes. At first I was a little turned off by the lack of steering feedback but the comfort it provides when driving down bad roads is a blessing. You don't have to fight this car, it is under your command and will do your bidding. The body roll is minimal. It has less body roll than many sports cars I have driven, coupled with the symmetrical AWD, its fun on the twisties, for an SUV that is. The braking is also very responsive and I have already had experiences with people cutting me off and it just digs in to the ground but doesn't take away your control. If you want to test a cars brakes, come to Florida during season. This car is Florida season approved, if there was such a thing.
<br><br>
Looks are great, much preferred over the past models Subaru has put out, but then again that's a matter of opinion. The forester doesn't brandish fake scoops or anything to augment its looks and thats how I like it. I like simple and it looks great while being simple.
<br><br>
The space is ample inside. I traded my crew cab chevy 3500 for this and I am happy with the space. Nowhere near a large SUV but I keep thinking its larger on the inside. Might have to name it Tardis but its not blue. 
<br><br>
For the power and space the 2016 Forester offers is really economic. It has enough get-up-and-go but also has superb gas millage and if you find the sweet spot and hit the cruise control you can easily surpass the EPA rating.
<br><br>
The way I define comfort is that the car does what it needs to do when it needs to do it while making the experience a positive one. It doesn't have temperpedic seats with butt warmer and a coffee maker, but as previously stated this is not what Subaru had in mind with this car, or so I think. This does not mean its uncomfortable, I like the seats (great lumbar suport), tilt and telescopic steering wheel is really nice to get that perfect ""in control"" feel. The leg room is ample and the storage is great. Getting in feels like a large car, and looking out of the windshield feels like an suv. The windows are big and there is virtually no blind spot to speak off. a quick glance to the side, after looking out of the mirrors, is more than suited for merging. Batman could drive this and not worry about raising his insurance premiums due to his limited neck rotation. 
<br><br>
Overall, I couldn't be happier with the car, Its what I wanted, something nice, comfortable, reliable, strong, with excellent off-road capability and economy that matches that of cars. Very well rounded vehicle.",pos
"It takes premium gas.
The paint chips easily.
There is no light in the back hatch area, very hard to see at night.",pos
"If you are looking for peppy acceleration (we recommend the XT model) and quite cabin interior (wind noise is constant during freeways driving) ... Then, you need to look elsewhere. But, we love Subaru for its functionality and peace of mind it give us knowing that the car will take care of us through our journey - pavement jungle or the real jungle.  This is our 5th Subaru and it won't be the last one for certainty.  Although, the Forester is a great vehicle,  when we make a long distance trip,  we preferred the more comfortable Outback our 4th Subaru (it feels heavier,  more planted and better fuel mpg).  It would be great if the diesel engine option was available since it gives better fuel economy and torque for a bit more towing capacity.  We want to test drive the 2018 model since most of the models have the X-mode.",pos
Test drove multiple cars in this class. Several of which were rated higher..very happy with my decision to pick Subaru.,pos
Still the best car I have ever owned...,pos
"Solid car, not a sports car, but acceleration is ok.  Took a 1100 mile trip, drove in hard rain and winds for 2/3 of the distance and handled both well.  Traded in a 2011 Avalon, so had to adjust to stiffer ride and a little more noise. 
Still happy with the car, had a tire blow out at 75 on the right rear, hit some construction trash, but was able to pull off on shoulder with no problems.  Only problem, in remote Texas late at night,  road service is severely limited, had to drive on donut spare for about 150 miles at very slow speed.
01/08/17  I traded for a RX 350, I missed the better ride, noise and comfort.",pos
"I believe you're either a Subaru person or you're not. If you appreciate their engineering bias (over styling), great safety reputation and aren't concerned with the hottest gimmics (like LED light accents), you could be a Subaru person... . This is our 6th Subaru product, and we've driven nearly every one of them  over 150,000 mi., on average. The one that didn't make it to the prime of life ended up the basis for a commercial (Outback totaled when it left highway). 

Despite being Subaru loyalists, have to admit there are a few warts to mention. Details that Subaru could do better - get rid of ugly wheels, nicer color choices (like a nice dark blue), fix high oil consumption and reduce engine noise (esp when starting from cold) are personal gripes.

UPDATE: Looks liked Subaru was reading my mind when they updated the 2017 Forester.. . LED lighting accents, new rim choices and added noise isolation - still some rather bland color choices, and no idea what they might have done about oil consumption.

Our '16 Forester has a modest 9000 miles on it, and as expected, has had zero issues with it. Our only complaint about how vehicle was delivered was that dealer ran it through a car wash which slathered ""hot wax"" over windows - which took several attempts to remove. 

The biggest gripe (which may have been resolved since our model) is the infotainment screen and instrument panel. Would LOVE to have a digital speedometer read out (analog unit hard to read), and would appreciate having individual read out for low tire pressure (vs. idiot light). The center screen is a hot mess, with stray hand movements causing it to go into unwanted choices. In addition to being hard to tune/select, have found it impossible to directly tune stations on radio - even contacted Subaru to see if we were missing something... . It's a pain to have to scan for specific station when driving (esp. with Sirius) when it would be relatively easy to enter station numbers.",pos
We have only had our forester for a month and we already have 1500 miles on it. We have driven Hondas and toyotas and feel you can't beat them but loved the features of the forester. So far we are very impressed with the quality of our new Subaru and with Byers Subaru dealership. The salesperson told us to bring our car in as much as we wanted for a car wash. I was pleasantly surprised when they even sprayed off the all weather mats and swept the interior!,pos
"It's a pretty great car if you're realistic. I traded my wife my C250 Mercedes for the new Forester XT (FXT), at first several things felt very cheap compared to the Benzo. After spending three months and 6k mi in it, I realized why the engineers did what they did and why this is a popular selling car. The car is comfortable and has great visibility, the Premium trim has everything you NEED plus some extras (i.e. pano roof and seat heaters). The turbo engine pulls strongly and the CVT transmission is not as obtrusive as many car enthusiasts say it is, I believe Subaru has very well executed their Lineartronic transmission for this application. The interior isn't as luxurious as a Benz but frankly, it shouldn't be... it's a practical car. If you're realistic on what you want your Subaru to do and why you're buying it, it is pretty ideal. I wanted something to go off road on the weekends and commute to work during the week. The FXT serves its purpose well providing a very large back seat and great cargo room in the back. The turbo requires synthetic oil and premium fuel (as do most other modern turbocharged, direct injected engines) and there hasn't been any oil consumption or other engine issue to note. When cold starting, the engine shimmies just barely, but this is normal so ignore other peoples claims of a rough idle, they're seriously over exaggerating it. The Subaru Starlink system is nice but pretty gimmicky, I do like the remote locking and tracking features but frankly could have done without.  What I absolutely love about the vehicle is the go anywhere prowess.... I live in dry, Southern California where I go hunting for snow and dirt trails. I've taken the FXT off roading in moderate and medium trails and have been very impressed with the capabilities with it's AWD system (by the looks of the 4Runner and Jeep owners, they were too). I will say that on a moderate or medium trail, you're really pushing the car to it's limits... in retrospect I don't know what I was thinking. Either way, it's a great car and highly recommended.

Update... I've got almost 25,000 miles on it in just over a year and a half. Still zero oil consumption, zero problems and 24.5 lifetime mpg. That figure comes from a lot of commuting and long highway miles. I'm pleased with almost every aspect of the vehicle, here's where i'm still left wanting:
     -OEM tires are truly awful. Terrible wear, terribly feeling, loud and awful grip. I've never had a terrible Bridgestone product but i'm so disenfranchised that i'll be going to Michelin shortly. 
      - The only replacement tires are passenger car tires unless you special order or take really subpar off road tires. Unfortunately you're caught between a rock and a hard place.. pun intended.",pos
my scores say it all. This is a well-engineered car engineered with the driver in mind. It consistently delights me.,pos
"This is my second Subaru Forester.  My first one was a 2005 fully equipped 2.5xt.  I LOVED the way my car handled in all weather conditions and the pick-up of the turbo engine was a big selling factor for me.  When it came time to trade in my 2005 I test drove a Honda CRV, Toyota Rav, Nissan Rouge, Ford Escape, Ford Explorer, Subaru Forester touring and premium, Subaru Crosstrex and a Subaru Outback.  After spending hours looking at reviews and test driving vehicles I ended up right back at the Subaru Forester, but I wanted the turbo charged engine.  I found the Forester 2.5i did not have enough kick for me, so I special ordered a 2.0 XT premium.  I’ve had my car for a couple of weeks now and LOVE IT.  I have found the cabin noise I hated in my 2005 has been resolved with a new body style.  It’s great to hit the highway and be able to talk to someone without shouting.  I love where the new intakes are in the front of the car.  We had an ice storm last week and it handled beautifully on the ice.  There were people sliding all over the road and mine stuck to the road like glue.  It has far more room with the new body style then my 2005.  The performance has greatly improved along with my gas mileage.  I used to average 18 miles/gallon in town and now I’m getting 21 miles/gallon.  (Would get even better if I didn’t have a lead foot.)  My only complaint is I have found the seats to be a bit uncomfortable, but I will get used to that.  It’s more like sitting on a log now then a nice soft bed.  I had a 148,000 miles on my 2005 before trading it in and hopefully I will be able to get this in my new Forester.",pos
"I had been looking to buy an SUV for awhile and looked at several. I hadn't really thought about a Subaru, always thought they got lousy gas mileage. But after reading reviews on them I realized they were up there with the other SUV's and beat most of them. I am hoping mine gets a little better but I have been averaging 26 miles in town driving so it's not bad. Haven't really had it on the highway enough to know how it will do on trips. Only had the car about a month now so it should get better. I love how big the doors swing out for easy entering or exiting. Believe me, I researched a lot before I decided to buy this car and so far it meets my expectations. Love the bluetooth and my grandkids love having a USB port so they can play their own music when they are with me.  I hope to get many years of use out of my Forester which is a base model with a few options added.  So far no complaints! I really like how I can see out of all the big windows. For the money, I don't think any of the other small SUV's can beat them. 

Update, almost 2 years later: Getting better gas mileage overall. Lots better on highway (about 35 or 36 sometimes) Sometimes it sounds like the 4 cylinder is really struggling when you step down hard on the gas but it gets me where I need to be and still happy with my Forester! Would definitely buy again!",pos
"Drove everything in this class. Subaru clearly has the advantage. This car currently has 23,000 miles and combined city and highway I am averaging almost 29 MPG!
This car will grow on you the longer you have it. Well done Subaru!",pos
"I'm thrilled I choose the Subaru Forester! I love how it rides! The additional features (dimming mirrors, back camera, etc.) are great. I'm a bit concerned how low the low gear will work inclement weather, as it doesn't seem to slow the vehicle as much as I'd like. Navigating through the musical list selections can be a bit cumbersome as well. The rear seat area has a great deal of space and leg room, perfect for my growing kids. Plenty of cargo space as well, enough for a weekend's worth of soccer gear and a grocery run. Overall, I am very pleased with my new Forester. I also have received exceptional service from the dealership, both during the sale and after the purchase as well.",pos
"This car has probably got the greatest turning radius of any vehicle I've ever been in...it practically turns on it's hind wheels!  Very easy to park...parallel parking is a snap with the turning ability and the backup camera.  It's solid on the road - although I haven't tried it in snow...I have taken it on rutted dirt roads and it drives like a dream.  The pickup is smooth and instantaneous (which is what I wanted...I wanted those ponies to race getting onto a freeway....and they do :)  )  For a 4 cylinder engine...it's got some moves.  Mileage is a little less than I'd hoped, but not too bad.  It's a heavier vehicle (obviously) than my Honda civic so I'm putting gas in it about a third more often than before (most of my weekly driving is in town) but it takes regular so the cost isn't outrageous.  The interior design is stellar...there are almost NO blind spots in this car!  The entertainment center and the climate control are my biggest disappointments.  I got the basic package...and the sound system is less than wonderful.  It's ok but...could be better.  The climate control is a little difficult to maneuver while driving and I would have preferred something other than dials.  A better design would have been to place that portion of the dash at an angle to make it more available to the driver.  The control keys on the steering wheel take a little getting used to....and the Bluetooth can be a little frustratingly slow and cumbersome.  Outside of those tweaks...I'd still buy this car.  I'm enjoying every minute I drive it.",pos
I love my new car,pos
"Ok, I am shopping for a new vehicle and my list is the 2016 models of the Ford Escape, Mazda CX5, and the Subaru Forester.  I added the Forester recently because it looked great on paper.  I've test driven it twice now with the second time with the family.  I thought it felt great, but my wife hated the feel as a passenger.  She felt nauseous because the vehicle swayed and bounced like a ship on turbulent waves.  We own a Nissan Frontier and a Mitsubishi Outlander.  She has no issues with either of those vehicles.  So I put the Forester back down to #3 on my list and will have her test drive my #1 pick before I purchase.  It does us no good if she's queasy as a passenger.  Something to think about if you purchase this vehicle.",pos
"Subaru has hit a home run with its Forester 2016. This is a very optimal vehicle, refined design, excellent safety rating. Really love the drive and handling. Visibility is the best I found in any vehicle. Very roomy interior. After using Hondas for more than 20 years this is the first Subaru we bought. So far very pleased with it. Drive mostly local with occasional highway driving. Very impressed with fuel economy, given this is an AWD.",pos
"Tried the honda crv which has engine vibration at idle. Tried the rav 4 which was more expensive, cheap paper thin leather seats, and an annoying lip on the lower side of front passenger side.
Rav 4 did have a super smooth transmission.   The Forester had a quiet engine, a semi smooth transmission,  and superior cabin noise insulating properties in which road sounds were muted and you can have a conversation inside without raising your voice.   They are priced below competition,  so not too much price reduction due to high demand and low supply.",pos
"I think this is a great smaller SUV. Plenty of room in the cargo area for various activities. I have enough room for groceries, packing up for long camping trips and even moving wood and materials for home projects. Seats and ride are extremely comfortable even with the sport tuned suspension. Great power and I love the option for S#/S/I modes. It'd be nice to have a digital speed readout like on my husbands WRX but you can read the speedometer just fine. The steering is responsive and hugs the road well around corners. I wish it had a higher tow rating but 1500lbs is enough to tow a trailer with a atv and few dirt bikes so it fits my needs. I'm happy with the gas mileage. I really enjoy the upgraded infotainment system, Bluetooth connection is great and the touch screen is really responsive. I love the look of this vehicle, it's aggressive looking with a very comfortable ride. I actually got my mother in law to buy one as well. I would recommend the forester to anyone looking for a smaller SUV with a good amount of power, comfortable ride and reliability and reputation of Subaru.",pos
Best bang for the buck!,pos
"It runs fun I love it. If the fuel efficiency can be improved, that's the best!",pos
"2+ years and about 42k miles later, and no real problems. Great on gas for SUV, best visibility I've ever had in an automobile, and phenomenal AWD. Can't tell from outside but it has a ton of cargo space. I've used every inch of it multiple times. Fit my daughters dresser in it! Plain entertainment and comfort but I don't care for the bells and whistles. I want practical, safe, and fuel efficient. This car has it. Only ding on it would be that it burns oil. Fuel changes are every 6k with full synthetic, but I usually need to add about a quart around 4k.",pos
It seems to have more room for storage in back than many of the SUVs we drove. It has zip and feels like it really hugs the road. We have had some pretty icy conditions on and off this winter and this car feels so secure.   No issues in the year and a half I’ve had it. I have to say that I still think it was a great buy. I love my car!,pos
"Great little SUV, good on gas and very reliable. Was looking at CX-5 and RAV 4 but decided to go with Forester because the best all wheel drive system.",pos
Still love my Subaru Forester especially during the winter months. It is the best vehicle that I have owned.,pos
When our 2001 Forester final wore out my wife said get me another red one.  She feels safe and in control even in the heart of Minnesota winter.  I did buy one with turbo and radar cruise control for me. Great decision still love the car.,pos
"This is the best vehicle that I have owned!  Do you want awd for rainy weather, snow, mud, etc? you got it.  Do you want safety features?  eye sight that helps to stop your vehicle before it crashes into something.  if your sleepy it beeps when you start to cross your lane.  Do you want easy of driving?  I love cruise control but don't like getting close to slower cars.  Mine has adaptive cruise control which automatically slows down and keeps a safe distance from the vehicle in front and speeds up when has the distance.  5 people fit in it but 4 is better for a long trip. took my 2015 forester from south Texas to the grand canyon.  there were 5 and it was a bit tight.  Sometime I take it awd in the mud and have a great time.  Have driven on the beach of South Padre Island and it is great.  Don't expect great gas mileage (I average 28) when in the mud and sand.  Carefully drove up a steep mountain road in New Mexico when it was icy raining.  I was happy to have my Forester.",pos
"Try it out , you will like it, insurance rates are likely to be lower too,",pos
"My wife and I test drove the; Mazda CX-5, Honda CR-V, Toyota Rav4, Nissan Rogue, and Ford Escape. In honesty the smoothness of the ride is probably tied for second with the Rogue losing to the Rav4. Does that mean its a bad ride? No! The Forester has a stiffer ""sporty"" suspension system but it was much better than the Escape and CR-V. The interior of the Forester is really great with materials and comfort of the seats front and rear. The outside noise isn't too bad to be honest, but I would say it could be a little quieter. There is plenty of space for all individuals. The sound system really is pretty nice especially since it wasn't upgraded or anything. The Forester has a lot of pep for a four cylinder engine with decent power to accelerate when you need and takes hills really well. When it comes to space within the Forester there is plenty for cargo and seems like tons with the back seats folded down. Whats super great is the minimal blind spots! You have such a wide back window and side windows with almost no obstruction to your vision and the side mirrors are located on the door to enhance viability of your surrounding. Subaru did a really good job on the Forester with safety (Look up the crash tests on YouTube if you don't believe me) compared to all other CUV's. Standard AWD is a great feature especially for those with crazy winters. My biggest ""gripe"" If we want to even call it that is the infotainment system. Talk about a pain having to put each contact from your phone in one at a time, yeesh. Most cars sync with your phone once your in the vehicle. Overall, the Subaru Forester is comfortable especially on long drives. Has great get up when its needed. Gas mileage is good! HWY from Southern California to Phoenix got me 32.9 mpg and back was 33.4 mpg (don't hear me complaining about that. Also we love how in the Forester there isn't an ""ECO"" button that chokes and compromises the car like the Nissan Rogue, Subaru just made a fuel efficient vehicle with decent power. If you haven't at least test drivin' it to expand your options, you should as my recommendation. Yes we're at 22k mileage with a ways to go, but hey reliability right? EVERY company has a lemon once in a while, but I have talked to a LOT of longtime Subaru owners and they have all stayed Loyal and loved their cars, so far we do too.",pos
"In five months I have put over 11,000 miles.  It is a limited demo model  had 5000 mile when bought.  The main reason I bought the forester and not the rav 4 or the crv was the seats, especially the driver's seat.  It is very comfortable yet firm.  I hope I am not jinxing my car but so far the vehicle runs great.",pos
"This car is well thought out size & space wise. The ride& handling is quite good. Interior is well thought out both size & layout of controls. I drove this car for several hundred miles & the seats are very good. The engine had enough power for the flat terrain I live in, the test will be in the very hilly & snowy area my son lives in.",pos
"Not normally a ""review"" gal but I had to defend the Forester. My prior car was a Hyundai,  relatively new,  that felt like a bucket of bolts compared to the Forester. If you are looking for glitz go somewhere else.  If you want a smooth ride with fantastic driver field of vision and feeling SAFE in your car, you should take the time to drive it. I have had mine for 5 months and love it. I have been consistently beating the predicted gas mileage. My very tall husband fits with room to spare.  Actually,  he leaves his E350 home for my Forester every chance he gets.  If that isn't an endorsement not sure what is.",pos
"We have owned ours for 2.5 years and have put 17,000 miles on the clock. Its reliable - no problems at all so far, everything still works. We average about 300 plus miles on a tank - city/highway combined. The features that truly stand out - amazing visibility from the driver seat, lots of headroom, love the standard rear view camera. Comfortable ride but with a fair amount of road noise but not terrible. Rear seat room adequate for car seats however front seats cannot be pushed all the way back if you are tall and have a rear facing car seat behind you. Adequate rear storage space although cheap plastic used over wheel arches - broke when I pushed in a stroller. Overall we are very happy with this purchase and plan to keep for at least 5-7 years.",pos
"Purchased this car new in July 2015. I driven this car to Yellowstone, The Badlands and North Carolina this summer and fall. Averaged over 30 mpg on all three trips. Car drives great on the highway and I have been receiving 29-30 mpg around town. Despite some reviews I read about this car using oil, my car has not used a drop in between 2 oil changes. Highly recommend this car. Just turned 36,000 miles this September 2016. Car still getting 29/31 miles per gallon in the city. Have not had a problem so far. Now have 43,000 miles and have not had one problem. Still getting great gas mileage.",pos
"I previously had a Ford pickup which I really loved except the gas mileage and my son needed a vehicle. So, as I just went over 200k miles on that - I passed it off to him.
For me, I wanted something that got at least 30 mpg overall, and preferably had a higher ride profile.  So, the smaller SUVs or a Crosstrek. I don't really care about fancy and I don't need navigation, 12 speakers, or a sunroof (not in Florida). I really didn't want anything with a turbo in it - a potential future maintenance issue (which knocked off the Escape from my list). So, I was looking for basic. I test drove several vehicles; last one being a Toyota Rav 4 - which was a nice vehicle but had too many blind spots. Plus, it had lots of bells and whistles I did not need (3 day weather forecast button and 32 station programming . . . what and why?).  So, I went to my local Subaru dealer and jumped in the base model Forester and within the first mile test driving knew this was it for me. So, pulling out various papers; TrueCar pricing, Edmunds and others, we settled on a price. Unfortunately, they did not have one in the color I wanted and I had to order it - no worries though, 2 weeks later and I had it - my first Subaru.
After 14 months of driving, what I really like about the vehicle are the following; the visibility is very good and that was important to me, The handling on very wet roads is excellent (the AWD was not something I was looking for in a vehicle - it is a pleasant bonus), the acceleration is plenty good, the room/storage inside is very good (my dog enjoys it), the maintenance is covered by the dealer for 2 years . . . nice !, the gas mileage is great !! I have actually averaged 35.5 mpg on a trip (all highway). So, lots of good things !
I am a very happy owner. I am averaging 31.2 mpg and my driving is approx. 40% highway, 30% city and the other 30% is country driving (not highway and not city, steady 45 mph stuff, not many lights/stop signs). I have 15k miles on it after 14 months.
The only negative thing I can say about the vehicle is that the paint is too thin!  We have many dump trucks in Florida and they are suppose to be tarped/covered but many tarps are nothing but rags and if you get stuck behind one . . . . and I have, and I now have several little chips on the hood and fenders where the small stones have chipped the paint to the metal . . . yikes. I have waxed it several times and hoping that will keep rust at bay. But the paint is thin. The only other minor issue, living here in the heat, is the overhead storage for the sunglasses gets pretty hot and I now have a ritual to hold the sunglasses in front of the AC vent to cool before putting on (very minor thing as I could put them in a case before putting in storage hold).
Overall, I think the Forester is an excellent vehicle. Gas mileage, visibility, peppy engine, handling is all very good. And it has a very high safety rating. I definitely would buy again and recommend to others. Paint issue, while I think it should be improved by Subaru, is not that big a deal. But, given that it is advertised as a adventurous-type vehicle; camping, nature, pet-friendly, etc. You would think the paint could handle roughing it some.",pos
"I've had my 2015 Forester for almost an entire year now and I'm at 17,000 miles. When I was shopping for a new vehicle, I didn't even consider Subaru. The day I went test driving all of the vehicles that were on my list, I was highly unsatisfied with everything that had happened at other dealerships, and on a whim, my parents were like ""WELL LETS CHECK OUT SUBARU!!!"" 

The knowledgeable sales people, warm environment, and the ""quality you could feel"" with the Forester is what sold me. The giant glass sunroof is also an extra perk. During the winter months, I made it EVERYWHERE with complete confidence. And I even tested out X-Mode on my friends extremely snow-covered driveway.....it works flawlessly. Highway MPG is also fantastic. I average 32-35. I highly recommend this vehicle or any Subaru. They have a feeling like non other. So far, no complaints.




Updated Review: I ended up trading my Forester for a 2017 Subaru Outback 3.6R. Nothing against the Forester....They fulfill their intented purpose flawlessly. However, I wanted a vehicle with a better ride, handling, and more powerful engine.",pos
"Purchased car in Auburn, Washington, and had the best customer experience ever in over 40 years of car buying.  Took a road trip to Yellowstone and was very satisfied with performance, handling, standard radio system.  Averaged over 32 mpg on a trip that was mostly highway driving, but, included mountains and a few days of backroad touring on paved roads.  Around town mileage is somewhat lower, but, averaging better than 24 mpg in suburban driving. Only disappointment so far is air conditioning effectiveness - cooling is marginal in direct sun when over 90 degrees (perhaps due to untinted windows on base model).  

Not a single mechanical problem has surfaced so far.  Very satisfied with the car and ownership experience to date.",pos
"First off, I read every single review on every single website I could find about this car, spent hours doing research and watching videos before deciding, the best source is cars101.com! all about subarus!! I am coming from an '04 Nissan Frontier pick up truck, so this is an entirely new feeling/ride for me, both of my parents have Mercedes, so I have comparison on both ends of the spectrum. I test drove the forester 2.5i & 2.0L, cherokee, patriot, cx-5, rogue, rav4. And then I also peaked at the honda cr-v and the kia sportage. The top priorities for me were cargo space, reliability and gas mileage, then I wanted something a little different, with some flare for under 28-30K. The XT package is so rad man, my car came with the gunmetal grill too, its so clean, the rims rock, the front of the car is aggressive, sporty! I don't know why people hate on the styling of this forester, I think its the best looking CUV on the market, I love the boxy look too. All my friends dig it and say it looks like a BMW - but thats the XT. I am a hand drummer and percussionist and I sometimes need to load over 30 drums and percussive items in my car for events, I fit more instruments in this car with the back seats down than I could fit in my entire truck with a tunnel cover on, I was also able to fit my 19"" frame road bike in the back with ease (get the cargo cover and rear seat protectors!). Gas mileage so far is lower than I expected in the city driving (14 - 21 mpg), but higher than expected on freeway drives (27 - 35 mpg). I don't commute to work over the summer, so I'm mostly driving city, I calculated the MPG on my own and I'm avg. 20 MPG... not stoked about it, but man... I got that turbo engine and it rocks my world, so much pull in the S# mode, its such a hoot to drive, makes be care less about filling up the tank as often as I did in my 2004 pick up.

Addressing some of the issues that most unhappy buyers complain about... 

#1 Seats: im 5'11"" 165 lbs. I fit in the seat nicely. yeah the bottom of the seat is a little short, but honestly I wouldn't have noticed if i didn't read all the damn reviews about how uncomfortable the seats were. They are definitely firm and they are lacking some major lateral support, especially for how well the car corners. I don't think the lumbar is obtrusive. Anyways my experience is funky... I hated the ride after I took it on a drive longer than a 10 minute tester drive. I constantly had kinks and tension in my neck and shoulders. I have long legs so i would pull the seat back for leg room but then feel like i couldn't grab the steering wheel without leaning forward. So i read into the reviews, I was so upset, the new car feeling was gone, I tried different seat additions and was looking into custom covers with built in cushion support (I might still do it to get more lateral support) - I think its the cleanest and cheapest way to make the seat comfortable without cutting it open and messing with the warranty and OEM parts. Long story short... I woke up one morning and the pain just stopped. it was so weird, at least thats what it seemed like. the pain when driving just went away... I think I got used to it, take it on a long test drive if you're worried - ill report back after my upcoming road trip!!

#2 Stereo: I worked the kicker speaker set and the tweeter kit into the deal for my vehicle. So they put it in for free. I got to drive around for about a week with the stock system, I am a musician so I feel like I am a little picky about my audio. Stock isn't bad, it distorts a little at high volumes and the sound isn't very clear, the kicker speaker kit does help with the distortion, but the lower end coming from the stereo isn't very clear at all, its very boomy. I would love to change out the head unit, but I am not going to mess with the warranty yet. Have them put the kicker system in, Im sure you will love it. I am just not crazy about the sound coming from the OEM stereo unit. I LOVE the layout though, don't need a nav with the iPhone and don't need the bright lights, the deck and whole interior for that matter is so simple and functional - I'm all for simplicity. 

#3 Bluetooth: I have had ZERO issues at all pairing with my iPhone 6. you don't get your contacts to merge, but so what? hold you siri button and ask her whoever you want to contact. I haven't experience i single dropped connection and the phone connects automatically every time i get in the car and turn it on.

Get the xt touring, you'll love it!!!

Update:
Had the car now for a year and half.... Great ride, stable, safe, don't use turbo as much, but it's nice to have. I wish it was a little bit heavier of a ride. For 30k I could have gotten a Mercedes C class or a Jeep Wrangler. It would serve be better now. Nonetheless this Subaru is sweet man. Such a convenient ride, easy to drive and easy to park throughout LA. Quick and nimble and fun. No issues so far.",pos
"It's been a year and we are still very pleased.  Below is my original review:

All early reviews were great, but later reviews were a little more negative. We traded 2006 BMW X3 and were looking 4 safety and reliability. We are very happy and love how it drives.

Feedback to negatives:
Burning oil: Its a CVT, it requires synthetic oil. Duh 
Red console: While red is the hardest color in the spectrum to read, it is also the easiest on the eyes. It is safer to have red, blue/white= bad. This SUV provides for a very comfortable ride & not as loud as described. Quick Acceleration: Reminds me to slow down & saves gas. 

I'm slowly becoming a Subaru dude. I don't know what that means, but my friend says I will start eating granola.

We love the car!",pos
"Not much has changed in my overall opinion over that past 5000 miles.  Still a hoot to drive, lots of pull with the turbo engine.  I installed an aftermarket tow hitch to carry my mountain bike, still have plenty of ground clearance.  Gas mileage has been fine at around 22mpg, with mostly city driving.  Have seen over 30mpg on slower highways(65mph).
Will be installing snow tires next winter, had it up in the mountains in some pretty deep snow and slick roads, it made it up no problem with the OEM tires, but I do like the extra grip of snow tires on slick roads.

"I've had my Forester xt for 7 Mos. now and have enjoyed driving it a lot. It has a roomy interior and comfortable seats. Excellent  visibility and driving position. Acceleration is brisk and smooth. Handling is adequate  based on how I drive and what I expect from a mid-sized SUV. Haven't driven it on dirt forest/logging roads yet, but I am confident it will do well over the rougher sections  with the sophisticated x-mode AWD system and good ground clearance. Gas mileage is 25-28mpg, which I consider good considering it's size and performance level.",pos
"This is our second Forester, and we are very pleased.  It is everything we wanted and expected it to be. We are getting about 22 MPG for real stop and go traffic, and about 31 or 32 for hops to the store or shopping - this is in-city, but not heavy, stop & go.",pos
"Just purchased the 2015 Forester XT Turbo.  Great speed as this Forester likes to run!  I bought the XT Touring loaded.  Mfg. Sugg price was $36,640 and payed $33,000 with .9% financing with money down.  Love the Forester!  Very well built with the reliability it's a real value, and sharp looking.  The only complaints I have are the original tires (which I traded in for Michelin Premier's that were a bit wider which helped the steering response and improved the ride and noise level.  The Forester has a stiffer ride so you'll feel the road, but that's fine with me as I love everything else about the vehicle.  Subaru really came through with this one.  It's my 1st and I can see why they sell!!",pos
"The Forester XT has been a solid and reliable vehicle for the past two years. It has performed its duty well as a outdoor activity vehicle that has included almost daily trips in the winter to ski, carrying my mountain bike on the tow hitch carrier, and several 500+ mile trips with my family.  The turbo power is greatly appreciated for merging into traffic and passing on two lane highways.  The handling is much better with the addition of a 19mm rear sway bar, and v rated summer tires.  I run winter tires and wheels during the winter months and consider those mandatory for the snow and ice conditions. Overall gas mileage is good, averaging 22mpg lifetime, mostly in mixed driving. I have seen as high as 30mpg on extended highway trips with the speed in the 65-75mph range. Here with the 80mph highway limits, 25-27mpg can be expected.
I changed out the turbo clamps shortly after purchase because the OEM clamps were notorious for loosening up and causing power loss and drivability issues. I check the clamps during the 6000 mile oil change intervals.  No unscheduled maintenance issues over the past two years, just oil and filter changes.  The OEM tires lasted 16k miles with 6000 miles rotation and correct tire pressure, but I do drive on curvy and steep roads so that may have shortened tire life.  I just purchased some V rated performance tires and have really come to appreciate the big improvement in steering feel and overall grip.
Overall, I am very pleased with the Forester XT.",pos
"This is a very good car.  Easy to drive, comfortable, roomy, and feels solid and well made. Mileage has been 29mpg combined road, mountain, and town driving. The CVT responds quickly and works very well (the engine is a little too peaky for a manual). The car turns in and transitions well on curvy mountain roads. It is actually fun to drive being taunt and predictable. Long highway trips are no problem, and neither are washed out, muddy, and rutted farm and mountain roads with the high ground clearance and real 4wd. I would buy a Forester again in a heartbeat as it has been a better all around car than I thought possible, certainly in its price range. 
It has been over a year and 30,000 miles since I wrote the above and I would not change a thing in my review. I have owned a lot of different cars in my life, but have never been loyal to a brand. My Forester may change that. It has done everything I have asked it to do, and done it well.  This is a very good car.

I have owned the car a little more than two years now, but it was totaled last week when a deer ran in front of me at night. No hitting the brake, no chance to do anything, as fast as you can say [non-permissible content removed], it was over with.  Hit it at a full 60mph. I was uninjured and no passengers were with me. Damage to the car was itself was relatively minor, but all the air bags deployed, which totaled it out. The air bags and the safety systems worked like they were supposed to, but let me tell you, it was as traumatic as hitting the deer! After it happened, it took about 20 seconds for me to regain my orientation and figure out that I was at a stop in the road. Luckily, no car was around to hit me, because I could not see out of the car well enough to get it to the side of the road (still running). All the interior lights had come on and with the smoke from the air bags, I could not see beyond the wind shield.  The  disagreeable odor discharged by the air bags was also distracting. The seat belt had pulled me  tightly into the seat so I was not hit with the steering wheel bag when it went off, but the bag under the steering wheel smacked my shins pretty good. The side air bags, running the length of the car, were the last to deflate and hung down so far that I could not see out of the sides of the car anyway. I guess the point of all this is just to say that air bags going off are no small thing, but, boy, I am GLAD they are there.
This Forester has been so satisfactory, I am going to get another one.

Got another one, 2017 model, after driving just about everything in this class of car. Best all round car out there for the money. I have about 25k on the new one and have not regretted my choice. Really good car!",pos
"We've had this car for 8 weeks, bought to replace our 2004 XT. It's astounding how far technology and design has improved. The car is so much more comfortable than the 2004 , especially
for 4 passengers. The Forester greenhouse has been preserved, which makes it one of the easiest cars to drive. The Eyesight system , with adaptive cruise control, object detection and automatic speed reduction works extremely well and very smoothly. The ride is a bit hard, not unexpected in a AWD small SUV with lots of ground clearance and sport rims and tires. The touchscreen MMI is simply awful...I cant believe Subaru fell short on this while doing so well on everything else. 

UPDATE: After 2 years plus of ownership, we are still very happy with this car. Great for city, road trips, hauling dogs and kayaks, kids to college. So far no mechanical or electric issues or repairs. MMI is still  frustrating.",pos
"This is my 4th Subaru. I also had a 2009 Forester and it was a great car.
The 2015 is quite a step-up.
The CVT is an excellent transmission and I regulary get 34 mpg on the highway and 25 mpg around town.


The Subaru Forester is unstoppable in the mountains of western Washington.
The 8.7"" of ground clearance allows the car to be driven almost anywhere.


The Premium package is simply amazing for comfort and quality.
The Forester is quiet and easy to drive.
Passengers in rear find ample leg room.
The storage is quite good for hauling things.

The trailer towing capabilities are limited but that's why I have Toyota Tundra. Long road trips are easy on the back with adjustable lum",pos
"In my opinion it’s worth the extra $$$ for the limited trim level! Before buying I drove Q5,XC60 & RX350 thought the highlander was the best bang for the buck.",pos
"Before buying a car, especially in this price range, a little research goes a long way. My choice was between the Toyota Highlander and the Honda Pilot, both top of the line models. The Pilot had an edge because I already own one. After test driving both vehicles at least a couple of times, I found that the safety features on the Toyota Highlander were better than those on the Honda Pilot. With the Pilot, I found that I had to purchase features such as a video system in order to get the lane shift feature I really wanted. I love the Highlander, which surprised me since I've really enjoyed my 2012 Pilot. The Highlander rides like a luxury vehicle. In comparing both 2018 models, the Highlander was a more luxurious, comfortable, feature laden car. ",pos
"Experts and customers agree, Highlander is the BEST midsized SUV for 2018.",pos
"Doesn't have all the bells and whistles for price compared to competitors as I compared the Nissan Pathfinder and VW Atlas as my final 3 SUVs. Nissan has to many transmission problems and the Atlas is just to new for me to trust. This is my 4th toyota so I know the reliability isn't an issue. Engine is strong, s mode even stronger. I am a little disappointed there is no digital mph like it was in my '15 camry. Upgraded to this for size as I've always been in a sedan or coupe I test drove a 4 runner and compared to the highlander it was rough. Meaning the highlander wasn't a hard adjustment from sitting low in a sedan or coupe my whole driving life.",pos
Test drive Pilot-very comparable,pos
This vehicle is far better in every way than a previously owned Mercedes SUV.,pos
Very smooth,pos
"So far a great car, believe it's comparable to a Lexus.",pos
"I had an '08 Highlander Sport for 5 years, then thought it was too big for just myself. I owned two AWD wagons for a while; they are great cars, but I missed the quiet, powerful ride of the Highlander. My local dealer was offering great incentives, so I went shopping. The '18 Highlanders have retained what I had loved in my '08, and naturally, improved on them as well. Now I can ride interstates and large highways for hours at 65-70 and hear my own radio, and not get fatigued. I'm back, and it's great! The XLE trim is the lowest you should go, but get the Limited if you can. The Highlander rides large, but it's quiet and powerful. It does not accelerate in a punchy manner, but you'll be going 55, thinking you're going 35. It's that smooth. Nice interior! Gone are buttons: it's all touch now. Wow. Exclusively, the Highlander has a shelf underneath the dash: once you've seen it, you're spoiled forever. Nice ambient, blue lighting. Great stereo in the upgrade to JBL's many speakers: you can hear the radio at low volumes! Do you know how much that means to me? Wonderful!",pos
"This 2018 is almost identical to our 2014, which we passed on to our daughter and family. We are very happy with both.",pos
"If you are in to speed or like the sports car ‘feel’ this car is not for you. If you want a smooth, reliable and SOLID ride, buy this car!!!",pos
"Fair warning, this review is long, intended to provide the kind of consumer details that professional reviewers won’t notice in their few hours with a car.  I generally agree with the professional reviews, and if only looking for a 30 second summary, my review is not for you.  We’ve owned our 2018 Highlander Hybrid AWD Limited Platinum about a month now.  Other contenders included a Lexus RXL, Audi Q7, Acura MDX and Honda Pilot.  While never unimportant, price was not the top concern and we bought which one we like the best.  That was the Highlander, including over the luxury brands listed.  Because we were comparing to and shopping the luxury brands, we ended up at the very top trim level possible.  Comments:  We’ve been getting about 25 mpg.  While not the EPA rating, the EPA doesn’t drive 75 mph either.  For a 4500 pound vehicle with over 300 hp, I’m hugely satisfied with the mpg.  While many reviews single out the infotainment center as a “con”, it was a huge plus and primary selling point for us.  I hate anything that looks like a tablet was stuck to the dash or involves a mouse, joystick, wheel or any other weird input method.  The Highlander uses a touch screen, flush mounted in dash, as it should be.  Regarding device connectivity, you can connect both a phone and another device for music (like another phone) at the same time if you want.  Convenient to have the kids DJ from the back seat, while still keeping my phone connected.  The system downloads all contacts, can directly control device music, reads your incoming texts aloud, streams Pandora or other content from a device.  OK, it’s not CarPlay……but I think it’s better.  Takes about a day to learn, but awesome after that.  Toyota, don’t change a thing.

The 5 USB power ports (2 in front, 3 in back) are a big deal and a “must have” for our family.  Not all competitors had this.  The 110 AC household plug is nice too….already used it to keep the crockpot plugged in and warm enroute a Super Bowl party.

At the higher trim levels, the interior is luxury level.  On par with the Lexus RX, better than the Acura MDX in our opinion.  As professional reviewers have noted, the seat comfort is world-class.  By far the best of any comparable vehicle we looked at.

While I can’t disagree with the professional reviews that XLE is the “value” trim level, it’s not ridiculously more to move up.  Limited adds $3K, then Limited Platinum adds another $3K. For perspective, each is well less than 10% of the vehicle price, or collectively, about 15%.   For that, you get the following - upgraded wheels, upgraded audio, panoramic moonroof, surround view cameras, front and rear parking sonar, 2 person memory driver’s seat, power passenger seat, LED daytime running lights, heated 2nd row seats, heated steering wheel, heated mirrors, air conditioned front seats, rain sensing wipers, cargo cover.

To us, it seemed very worth it, especially if comparing to and considering luxury brands.  On the luxury brands, the option packages cost more than that and often don’t even deliver nearly as much.  While not “required”, many of these options are a big deal to us and certainly worth paying for.  We use them all the time.  Heated second 2nd row seats…. our teenagers love ‘em.  Surround view cameras and parking sonar, tremendously helpful.  Driver memory seats – needed for a family vehicle where more than one person drives.  Panoramic moonroof that extends all the way over the 2nd row – kids love that too.  These are great family vehicle options, which is exactly what the Highlander is.

Drivewise, the ride is mini-van-esque, which is a good thing (doesn’t drive like a truck).  Nothing exciting, but pretty much what you want in a family hauler.  While I wouldn’t call it an everyday 3rd row, the 3rd row is very serviceable for occasional use and more than met our expectations.  When folded, it also looks neat and flush.  Some of the competitors didn’t.  

In summary, the family features are what make this car.  Specifically, all the USB power ports, the panoramic moonroof, the heated seats for everybody, the adequate 3rd row, the driver memory seat, passenger power seat, the ability to connect multiple Bluetooth devices simultaneously.  Most vehicles just focus on the driver.  The Highlander focuses on the whole family, especially at the higher trim levels, which is exactly why we bought it.  A month later, we’re still loving it and are 100% convinced we bought the right vehicle.",pos
"This car is a step up from my old Honda Accord in terms of comfort, safety, noise, and handling. Very good construction & interior quality in addition to numerous safety features. So far, it's everything I expected in a Toyota.",pos
It is the best SUV on the market.,pos
Test drive other SUVs and do your homework.  Find a dealer you like.  After 9 years with the same dealer we went to another.  Best decision ever.,pos
"Overall a really great vehicle, very comfortable. Interior could be a bit classier but it is still good. This is a family hauler and it does that incredibly well. This is a solid generally pleasing vehicle. I test drove countless competitors comparable models multiple times. It took me 3 months to make this decision. Overall ride quality and standard options combined with Toyota’s undeniable reputation of quality and dependability won me over. I have to admit though that every American made suv in this class was superior in comfort, quality of interior materials, ride comfort and amenities out shown every Asian vehicle we tested. However these tended to be priced higher and there is of course the questionable reliability. We tend to keep our vehicles for a decade or more so dependability was the ultimate deciding factor. There is one large problem with the Hylander, the outdated and outgunned engine infotainment system. This system is difficult to navigate and lacks basic things like smart phone mirroring. I am at a total loss on why Toyota would install such a poor system especially when just about every competitor has a much more advanced and intuitive infotainment product. I will say this though the navigation programming is excellent. It is easy to set, has nice graphics that make sense and are easily readable.",pos
second highlander i have owned. first for 15 years with no problems . now in new mexico with son. if this is as good as first it will last my lifetime,pos
They are a good reliable suv that is great with driving around a group of grandkids,pos
"I am in regional Sales and generally replace my Highlanders every three years or so.  My first was a 2004.   I traded my black 70k mi 2014 XLE AWD for a 2017 gray/black LE Plus AWD.   Why the LE Plus over another XLE?  Well, the LE Plus has the features that I use/like the most on the road- power seat, leather wrapped wheel, upgraded audio (excellent sound quality), power lift gate with flipper window, 3 zone auto climate control.  After negotiating my best deal among 3 dealers, the LE Plus was 4K lessthan the XLE (you recoup some of the XLE cost when you sell, though).  The feature that I missed the most initially was keyless entry and go.  This is my first car in 15 years without a sunroof(which I don't really miss).  Really like my LE Plus - I added bodyside moldings, rear bumper protector and all weather mats.  It came with Michelin tires and the ride quality is superior to the deuhler HLs.  The safety sense is a great system, and the lane keeping feature is really neat.  I also like the auto dimming headlamps.   Overall, this Highlander is very comfortable for my 6'2"" frame and I would not hesitate to recommend it- its very reliable and has consistently high resale value.  The quality of the interior materials feels superior to most of its competitors.  I did look at the 2017 Pilot, which is larger, but the seat mounted armrests were uncomfortable and a deal breaker for me.  The interior of the Highlander is much nicer.",pos
"We have a 2017 Highlander, Limited AWD with the JBL premium sound system.  If you have a choice, DO NOT get the JBL system.  The Bluetooth system is terrible and EVERY phone call has a terrible ECHO making it unbearable to use.  We end up picking up the phone and not using hands free which is a big safety issue and illegal in some states.  I have had it to the dealer 4 times for this, and their final response to me this week was that it was a JBL issue and until JBL fixes it for them, there is nothing they can do.  ""Please be patient with us and we will let you know when it is resolved"".",pos
"Love love this car , I have been driving it for a month and love it!",pos
"From a man's point of view, I wanted to have only one new vehicle for both intown and cross country travel. This 2017 Highlander LXE replaced a 2009 Highlander AWD Sport with 200K on it that only had one part (less than $400) replaced.  Obviously that vehicle was passed down in the family.  We pull a 4300 pound travel trailer and  with wind and elevation gain the 09 got around 9 to 10mpg at 70mph.  With no bike rack or trailer, it averaged 23-24mpg on the highway.  The 2017 gets around 15mpg pulling the trailer and pulls much easier with the additional HP and speeds.  My wife enjoys all the safety features, GPS and phone system.  We have had the vehicle for only 1 month so can not comment on reliability,",pos
"My review us based on the SE model. I love the exterior design and new grill. However, the inside is very comfortable. My wife and I test drove and decided between the Highlander and the Honda Pilot. The Pilot was great also, but my wife(who is a lifelong Honda owner) said after the test drive that she did not want to like the Highlander due to her allegiance to Honda, but she ended up loving it. Very comfortable inside and the extras with the SE(cool rims, ambient lighting, stitch designed leather seats) give her a ""cool mom"" feel.",pos
"First 1700 miles..have been fantstic. Picked the Toyota over the Jeep Grand Cherokee n Ford Explorer! Look at the cheap fiber board wheel wells of Jeep n Ford at least Toyota has plastic in the front n some plastic in the rear,  If going on dirt roads fiber board wheel wells WILL NOT hold up over time.  The Toyota fuel economy is much better than expected. Getting 24.5 in city n 27+ on highway so far. Plus the V6 engine is the same as a Lexus RC 350.  Love having radar weather over navigation maps too. That is free for life. Overall a 10 plus so far...!",pos
"Spent many months researching before buying and ended up with an old favorite.  This is our second highlander and it is even better than before.  We found a 2017 certified used  (Dealer rental) and negotiated a real good deal.  Under $40,000 with 100,000 bumper to bumper warranty.  Only thing less than perfect are the front seat comfort is not quite soft enough for my old back (my wife who is picker than me has no complaints and thinks the ride is better than her Lexus) and the voice activated command is very temperamental.  I think that a little adjustment on my part will bring these up to Toyota standards.",pos
This everything I had hoped for and more. The Highlander is very comfortable and stylish. The safety features are an added reason to pick this great  vehicle.,pos
Shopped it!!  This is the Best in it's Class plus some!!!,pos
Very satisfied with my 2017 Limited Highlander. Like it better than all other SUV'S.Good ooks nice ride.,pos
"I considered many different vehicles including other crossovers as well as large body on frame SUVs (Land Cruiser, Ford Expedition) but settled on the Highlander because it offers great utility and people carrying ability in a platform that is relatively fuel efficient (20.5 mpg mixed/24 mpg highway) but still offers moderate towing capacity.  First the good:  Great fit and finish, solidly built, very high quality interior (many parts would look at home in a Lexus), smooth engine, great acceleration for a 5000+ lbs vehicle, roomy 2nd row seat, drives like a compact SUV, great projected reliability and 5 year residual value.  And the not so good:  3rd row seat is tight for adults (wouldn't plan on adults in the back for a road trip), no LED/HID headlights available at any trim level, no Apple Carplay/Android Auto, Navigation looks somewhat dated, infotainment screen hard to read in the sun or with polarized sunglasses, 8 speed auto has occasional rough upshift.  Overall I am very pleased with the Highlander Limited Platinum.  It has almost every bell and whistle and is a very comfortable and easy to drive vehicle.  I'm hopeful it lives up to its reputation for reliability.",pos
Good value for the price,pos
Great vehicle for pulling small travel trailer or tent trailer.,pos
"Make sure you understand the vehicle before you buy it. New vehicles are complex, as are the options available.",pos
"The Toyota Highlander Limited is a fun car to drive and ride. It has all of the most modern safety features including Blind spot, Lane assist, Lane departure, brake assist, collision avoidance, and radar cruise control. It drives very nicely and the steering wheel feels good and is heated. This SUV drives more like a large four door sedan than a SUV. The front seats are very comfortable with heated and cooled options.  The second row is heated but not cooled. The power lift gate is nice and you can open the back window without opening the gate. The only problem so far is matching the EPA gas mileage expectation.
I am updating my review from last September, 2017 when I first acquired this vehicle. It continues to impress me as I am amazed at the ride and comfort it provides. I did not think that it would satisfy my needs so completely. I have a slight physical impairment and driving this car helps me tremendously with this medical condition. I and my family feel very safe when we are in this vehicle. This is the first vehicle that I have ever owned that my wife will take away from me to go on one of her weekend girlfriend trips. We would definitely recommend this vehicle over any other in its class!",pos

"This is my 3rd Highlander, and they keep getting better every time.  My first Highlander was in 2006 and it was the size of the current RAV4.  This new one has more room in the rear and the back seat legroom.  The from passenger compartment feels like it has a slight bit more width as well.  The controls (radio/camera, etc.) are easier to use and more intuitive than before.  The only wish I had was that they were angled slightly towards the driver.  This is my first vehicle that allows you to shut off the car while in drive and at a stop by simply depressing the brake.  This has increased the gas mileage for me.  My last Highlander was a 2012.  I got about 360 miles to a tank (regular driving) on a 17 gallon tank (21.1 MPG).  The new one, with the same size tank is getting 425 miles to the same 17 gallon tank (25 MPG).  The comfort is better, and not just because it is new.  I chose the LE Plus because of the full 60/40 rear seats.  I did not want the captains rear seats, as it is impossible for someone to lay down on longer trips.  I also did not want the sun/moon roof (hardly used it and one less thing to worry about going wrong).  Plus the price difference for 2 things I didn't want really made my decision easier.",pos
This car is loaded with technology.  Sometimes it seems it is smarter than we are.,pos
"I just recently purchased my Highlander and I absolutely love it! In the past I have owned an Infinity car, a Lexus car and a Cadillac SUV. None of those has even come close to being what the Highlander is. Recommend this for families that are looking for reliable SUV",pos
Just bought it! Love the new design. Technology and safety features unbelievable. Very roomy without being too big.,pos
"My daughter has a 2014 Highlander and after driving it several times, I knew I eventually had to have one. The many included safety features was a big plus for me and there are times the eight seats helps with grandkids. My milage on highway is 28 and I take many long trips. The ride with the big tires is comparable to Lexus and I think it is better looking than the RX. Toyota reliability is legendary, so I plan on keeping it a long time. Update: I like this Toyota so much that I replaced one of our Lexus’ with a 2018 Camry two toned XSE V6.  It is gorgeous and love the power.",pos
"Plenty of space, good tow capacity and very comfortable.",pos
I have owned a toyota before with the V6 engine and the 6 speed automatic. The 6 speed shifted smooth. The new 8 speed automatic is okay but is a bit of a dog compared to the 6 speed. This car would be perfect if Toyota had left it alone with the 6 speed auto. The 8 speed can't seem to decide which gear it should be in.,pos
"Shop around for the best deal.  Just like the last Highlander, this vehicle is excellent.",pos
"The 2017 models are sportier looking and a little lower to the ground than the older models.  Handles like a dream and the safety features are awesome.  Fuel economy for me is better than posted which is wonderful.  Overall, a great vehicle!",pos
I'm happy to get this vehicle. This will be my retirement car.,pos
I have had the car for 8 months and love the car,pos
Great vehicle. Loads of space . Room for 8 with third row. Hugh list of safety features and std features. Very smooth and quiet ride.,pos
"This is a great Crossover with few compromises. We cross shopped the typical competitors; Honda, Mazda, Hyundai, GM, etc. Given we have/had a Mazda CX-5 and 6, thought it was natural we would end up in the CX-9. The CX-9 had too many compromises in practicality and options that didn't over come the driving fun part - this is a family commuter. The fact that Toyota Safety Sense is included is a real bonus. The lane  departure and radar cruise control are features you never knew you  needed before. There are more goodies that add up in terms of practicality and comfort. Items like 2nd row shades, heated front seats, heated mirrors, large 8""UI screen, 5 USB outlets, tri-climate control, leather seating in front rows, full function moon roof, a intercom system, solid V6 / 8spd auto, auto start/stop (could do without), ample small storage-notably the mid-shelf in the dash, navigation, power liftgate, reclining seats in the 2nd and 3rd row too, and a window hatch that opens independent of the rear gate! For us the Captains / bucket seats in the 2nd row was a must because of having supervision for multiple car seat riders that can be tended to without crazy gymanastics. All the above without having to step up to the top expensive trims; like in other brands. The higher trims on the Highlander have nice options but not worth the money for our lifestyle. Worth test driving the competition but currently there is no comparison in our minds in terms of the options, safety, reliability, and over all package performance. Keep the factory add on's to a minimum and you can get a good out the door price; keeping in mind you are in the market for a 3 row cross over. Online price comparisons don't always talk about the dealer fees and sales tax but it adds up. We were out the door for no more than $40K (2017 HL XLE AWD - Silver - Cptn Chairs OPTs - All weather mats, rear bumper protector) Good luck and safe driving.",pos

We were out the door for no more than $40K (2017 HL XLE AWD - Silver - Cptn Chairs  OPTs - All weather mats, rear bumper protector)  Good luck and safe driving.",pos
"I've been impressed so far by my FWD 2017 Highlander XLE. It is comfortable, spacious, gets reasonable gas mileage for a big car, and I love the active safety features and how well laid out the controls are. It is also very smooth and quiet on the highway and is a reasonable size for my garage and parking lots while still fitting lots of stuff. Note that I use it as a two row vehichle. The third row is really more for small kids on trips and adults at no more than short distances and when in use the cargo space goes from great to limited. I really like the blind spot monitoring. Getting about 27.5 mpg on highway and 25 overall so far. One thing I'm not a fan of is the throttle response. Transmission is programmed for economy so the car feels slower than it is and you really have to hit the gas to feel the power. If you floor it you'll find the car really moves quickly but otherwise it feels lethargic. Using the power setting improves this. The controls are very good on the car.",pos
"Bought this car as a downsize.   Traded in my 17 mpg Sequioia.    This car is MUCH smaller, much easier to drive, and much more ""car like"".   This is my second review.   The car is roughly 5 months old & has 3600 miles.   No mechanical problems thus far.   The ride is comfortable.   The front & middle seats are very spacious and comfortable.   The dashboard display is clear & intuitive.    Ride comfort is very good, but to be fair, roads where I live are very smooth.   Those who have criticized this car's acceleration are misguided.   We drive with the car in ""eco"" mode.   Acceleration is MORE THAN ADEQUATE!!!!    Step on the gas, and the car moves.   Overall mileage has been spot on EPA estimates:  roughly 22 mpg, with a bias of 65% to 75% city driving.   As for highway mileage, we took our first ""semi-long"" highway drive the other day, 300 miles round trip, 95% highway driving, set the cruise control at 68 mpg, and realized 28.4 mph upon fill up.   So, a 290 hp 3 row SUV, with full time all wheel drive, with air conditioning running the whole time, returned 28.4 mpg over a 300 mile trip.   Need I say anymore about fuel efficiency?    Pretty impressive, in my opinion.   If this car holds up like previous Toyotas, it's a no brainer, and should be on anyone's short list of 3 row. mid-sized SUVs.     11 months and 9,000 into ownership, we have only grown to appreciate this car more.",pos
"This is my third Toyota Highlander and I'm in love all over again with my new 2017 Highlander!  It is a classy, reliable vehicle that does not disappoint.  The gas mileage is phenomenal.  I love all of the technology.   I have nothing negative to say about it, except for a bit of disappointment in the quality of interior (ie floor mats are not nearly as sturdy as the ones in my 2010).",pos
"Best combination of safety, ride quality, value, and over all look.",pos
"Safety technology is incredible, gas mileage is great, love the look and feel of the car.",pos
"The Toyota HighLander is built in Princeton Indiana (USA). We bought because of the Mid SUV and the mid model XLE has more features at a great price. We have owned lots of autos and for the pricing it is very quiet,smooth ride and has tons of safety features on the mid line model. We choose the Walnut brown color because it is just a pretty color with black leather and second row captain seats. We are both happy we chose the HighLander.",pos
"My second Toyota Highlander Limited. This year's model is even more comfortable, quiet, and well appointed. Only thing I don't like is that they removed the power outlet from the rear cargo area.",pos
"Our third Highlander!  They just keep getting better and better. My only complaint is the complexity of the electronics. We shall probably get used to that, too.",pos
Shop around for best value,pos
"We traded in our beloved 2007 Highlander for the 2017 because we needed the higher tow capacity. Wow, wow, wow!  We feel enveloped in luxury and comfort. The 2017 has a much steadier ride, top quality materials and is more comfortable and roomy. We owned the Sport version previously because I hated the sloppy body roll on the regular 2007 Highlander. The XLE 2017 has a more responsive ride and corners better, it is much smoother and steadier overall and all of the seats are roomier and very comfortable. Love the telescoping steering wheel, front shelf and pop-up hatch window, too. I am struggling with the new technology, but learning to love and appreciate it fast. The Stop Start system works really well once you get the hang of how and when to use it and is almost undetectable in use.  Some of the climate controls are not intuitive (update-after owning this vehicle for one month...I am STILL struggling with the climate controls...only thing I can complain about really) and wondering why MPH not digitally displayed.   Hoping this new Highlander is as reliable as our 2007!  I am 5'6"" husband is 6'5"" and we both find it very comfortable my husband can't stop raving about this vehicle either. Wow!  Look forward to every drive now!  Update: No issues after a summer of driving and towing.  Towing is strong and steady. 1 year update - Vehicle is great, no problems about 10,000 miles.  Handles snow and ice superb, my old Highlander did not.  Also the 4wd button option has been used numerous times and worked perfectly for the situation for us.  EnTune is the only consistent headache for me.  It doesn't always work well with my phone/Pandora accounts and I have to reconnect constantly (no Pandora music if I don't).  Small issue with rear bumper 'melting' in a small spot near exhaust - Toyota is replacing at no charge.  We love the vehicle, it is perfect for our lifestyle of mountain biking, camping, hauling dogs around for hikes and bikes.....",pos
"We decided to upgrade our 2011 Highlander to the 2017 XLE AWD and could not be more happy with the decision. The new model has many safety upgrades and is a perfect family vehicle. Love the push button start, backup camera, and navigation. It is quiet, stylish, and handles very well. Looking forward to many years of driving enjoyment! Toyota makes the very best mid-size SUV that has a ton of features in a reliable package. Very pleased!",pos
"The Highlander is a great SUV. This is my 3rd one and is by far the best. The interior is more roomy and comfortable. I really like the shelf that it has over the charging portal for you phone etc., it is very convenient. It handle great. Although I have only had it 1 month I am sure it will just as reliable as my other 2 were.",pos
"I can't stop raving about my new Highlander! I saw the Pilot and MDX at the dealers and read a lot about the other competitors, Explorer, Traverse, Acadia, etc.  It has more standard features than the base level MDX or even a comparable Pilot - for example, to get the 2nd row Captain's Chairs in the Pilot you have to go to the highest trim level or to get the Honda Sensing safety features you have to pay 1,000, also Navigation is extra (at least on the EX-L). I love all the standard safety features that are included in the Toyota (collision mitigation, lane departure warning, blind spot monitoring, etc.) and it comes with optional Captain's Chairs (which are very comfortable) on the XLE. Yes, the 3rd row seating is smaller than the Pilot but we don't intend to use it that often and when we do it will be mainly for children so that was not a big issue for us. The rear seat cargo room when the 3rd row is up is smaller than the Pilot but again, we don't anticipate that being a big issue and I believe it is bigger than the other cars in this class. The fuel economy is what you would expect for a car of this size and weight. I did not get the AWD on purpose because we don't need it and it just adds expense, but having said that, finding a FWD was very hard - I call my car the ""unicorn"" because it was so hard to find. I look forward to driven this car every time I get into it!",pos
very good first month,pos
"I took delivery of this car just a month ago, so this is a preliminary review.   I can't comment on reliability, maintenance cost, etc.   I haven't owned the car long enough, but my experience with Toyota has always been outstanding.   Currently, we only have 750 miles on the car, so most of the ""review categories"" with respect to reliability & value that I rated ""OK or N/A"" could not be rated because I haven't driven the car enough.   So, disregard those.   This car for me was a downsizing.   We traded in a 2011 Sequoia SR 5 4WD with 54,000 miles.   It had never been back to the dealership after delivery and was trouble free.   We purchased the car in November '11, after the '12s were on sale, and walked out the door with the $40,850 sticker price Sequoia for $35K exactly.   Anyone who disputes Toyota's resale value, I received $22K for this trade 61 months later and 54K miles later.  So the car cost me $213/month.   I couldn't have leased it for that price.    Additionally, Earl Stewart Toyota in Palm Beach, FL discounted my new Highlander by $2700 off the sticker.   No hassle, no haggle.   What a great dealership!!!!    Now for the Highlander.   The XLE for 2017 now comes with blind spot monitoring, radar cruise control & lane departure warning standard.  These were not available on XLE trim in 2016.   It also comes with start/stop technology & Toyota's new 8 speed transmission.   It cost about the same as the 2016 model that didn't have these features.   The Highlander is much smaller than the Sequoia, (193 inches vs. 205, and a little smaller in width) and is much easier to drive.    There is plenty of space in the front & middle rows.     It is the 3rd row and cargo area where most of the space is lost.   Space it tight back there compared to the Sequoia for any adult no matter how much the front two rows are adjusted.   The only 3 row, mid-sized SUV with a roomier 3rd row was the Honda Pilot, but it's interior design paled in comparison to the Toyota & the advanced safety features I mentioned required taking a high trim level Pilot costing $1000s more than the Highlander.    With the third row folder, cargo capacity is generous, though not as large as that of a Honda Pilot.   As far as performance is concerned, even though we keep the Highlander in ""economy mode"", acceleration is plenty brisk, and there is no trouble merging onto a highway.   Those who report this car is underpowered are misguided.    It's not!!!!    It's not a Mustang GT or  Corvette fast, but next to the Pilot, CX-9, Pathfinder & MDX, it is class competitive.    The interior is very well put together, somewhat elegant, with lots of storage and the leather seats that are very comfortable.   The ride is generally supple, especially on smoother roads, but harsher impacts are a little more noticeable than in the Sequoia.   The back up camera & navigation work extremely well.    So far mileage appears to be better than expected.   We drive conservatively, which helps.   Doing mostly stop & start, city driving (75 to 80% of the time), with the air conditioner on, Tank 1 yielded 21.5 mpg and tank # 2 returned 22.5 mpg.   EPA is 20/26.   The start/stop technology works well, but it can be felt.   So far, We are extremely pleased with the Highlander.   It's perfect for a family of four or five, provided the 5 aren't all adult size individuals.   I'll post an updated review in a few months once we have accumulated a few thousand miles.",pos
"It has all the luxury of a luxury car though without a luxury label... with reasonable price. Comfortable and luxurious feeling. My wife loves it.
One improvement suggestion:  Though the vehicle has BSM (blindside management system), the car frame obstructs the view of front sides.  This makes it difficult to glance at obstacles when starting moving forward.",pos
"We love the Highlander but did not love the price. The safety features are the best, comfort is a close second.",pos
"This car is perfect for us.  We like the luxury of a nice car but also want something that can carry 4 golfers with clubs and luggage.  This car is great.  We also want to upgrade our 2009 Avalon (which was a great vehicle also) to some of the new safety features.  This Highlander is loaded with safety features!!!  I love the inside and outside look of the car also!  Perfect for us and I know the Toyota reliability will be there.  The price of a Toyota is high but the resale is also high.  I love the 7 year, 100,000 mile extended warranty for the vehicle also!  What a deal at a cost of $1400!",pos
"I recently purchased a 2017 Highlander XLE while my 2010 Prius (107,000 miles) was getting an oil change.  Call it an ""impulse"" buy, but I had been researching the Toyota Highlander for quite some time and with 0% financing available & a great deal from the local dealership, I left my Prius in the service department and drove home a brand new 2017 Highlander in Celestial Silver Metallic.  I've now had it a little over a week.  Initial impression?  Fantastic vehicle.  Very quiet.  User-friendly. Creature comforts that aren't ""over-the-top"".  Entune system is great.  Of course, I'm putting more gasoline in it than my former Prius, so that will take some getting used to.  My biggest surprise?  I emailed my insurance agent to change coverage over to the Highlander and it is over $100/year CHEAPER to insure the brand new 2017 Highlander than it was to insure a 2010 Prius!!  What does that tell me?  This vehicle is safe on the road.  The sight lines are much better than the Prius (that's not really saying much) and the Blind Spot Monitoring (BSM) is very helpful along with the Lane Departure Alert (LDA).  I am enjoying driving a bigger vehicle and will write another review after the ""newness"" factor wears off a bit.  For now,  very impressed and confident in this purchase.  More to come, later...",pos
"We compared this to the new Honda Pilot before buying.   The Pilot really shined from the 2nd row back where it has more room in the 3rd row and storage space behind.  The Highlander also had similar acceleration and handling.   One of the deciding factors was how horrible the new Pilot looks.   Let me put it this way  if a Civic and an Odyssey had a child it would be the Honda Pilot.   On the other hand, if a Camry and a 4 Runner had a child it would be a Highlander.   The active safety features can be a little overwhelming at first, but they all have sensitivity adjustments.   It really pays to sit and read the manual on this car as there are a ton of customization features from the loudness of the beep when you lock the door to the color of the buttons on the stereo.     I'm amazed by the quietness and smooth ride of this SUV.   The steering is effortless, but there isn't enough feedback.  It feels too much like a computer controller.  I'll add more to the review later as I have more time driving the car.",pos
"This is the only vehicle I've ever owned that I've enjoyed more than my '69 El Camino. The roominess is perfect to those long drives to Florida from Virginia and the suspension seems incredibly smooth. Also, it has 5 USB chargers which judging by the lack of bickering between my grand kids, is a great thing for keeping them pre occupied on their I-Andriods and bluetooth players. The engine is also smooth as silk and has the peppiness I need when pulling out into Florida traffic (people drive like animals)!",pos
"Very comfortable crossover with nice interior. I am 6'4"" and have plenty of room in the drivers seat. The standard safety features include dynamic cruise control, lane departure warning, rear cross traffic warning and pedestrian warning all work well and enhance the safety of the vehicle. Start-stop function is smooth and responsive and can be disabled if the driver does not want the added fuel savings. New 6 cylinder engine with 8 speed transmission proved sufficient power and smooth acceleration. The third row seating is limited and can only be used for adults during short trips or kids. Quality interior and exterior fit and finish.",pos
"The newly redesigned 2017 Toyota Highlander breaks all the rules for standard technology features, while delivering a luxury driving experience with a reasonable price tag. The 2017 Toyota Highlander delivers the best value, luxury, and performance on the market. (TK)",pos
"The 2017 redesigned Highlander is the best SUV on the market. It still retains the luxury SUV feel and comfort, all while bringing in new and improved upgrades! The new upgrades to the transmission makes stressful driving a thing of the past, with its comfortable shifting, cruising when you need it and power when you really need to step on it and put the pedal to the floor! And let me tell you, this baby has 5 USB ports! Who needs 5 USB ports you ask? Any family where the kiddos need to be constantly attached to their devices, thats who! That is genius on Toyota's part, now I dont have to listen to my kids complain and moan while we are all in the car. All I have to do is plug them in and they shut up for hours! I wouldnt consider anything other than the brand new 2017 Highlander, it has comfort, luxury, and power! I dont know what that other guy was talking about, if he really drove a Highlander he would know that everything pales in comparision to this beast of a machine! Plus, its got black tires, and who doesnt love that?",pos
It has a very solid feel and is quiet when compared to other SUVs I have had. I haven’t had it long enough to attest to it’s reliability,pos
The driver's seat is electric.      The passenger seat only works manually.    This was not discovered until 2 days after purchase.,pos
"We've had our 2016 Highlander for just under a year now, and we love it. We traded in our 2013 Corolla when we had our first child and we needed something with much more space for all the new things we had to tote around for baby. We researched 4 different brands of cars; Chevrolet, Jeep, Toyota and Ford. The Chevy and Jeep had poor reviews ranging from the Chevy Traverse catching on fire 2 days after having it and the Jeep Grand Cherokee having issues with also catching on fire and having an issue with it's parking brake not holding and rolling away. It came down to the Ford Explorer and Toyota Highlander or 4-Runner. The Ford was slightly less money but after I read the reviews on the Toyota (and being a previous Toyota owner and loved my old car) my husband and I agreed upon one of the Toyotas. There was even a review from a mom who said that she was t-boned by a drunk driver in her Highlander and the vehicle rolled, she and her two children survived and the drunk driver did not. Sealed my thoughts on what I wanted, but we test drove each one anyway. The 4-Runner drove nicely and was spacious, but it felt extremely bulky and top heavy to me. Probably more well suited for someone who wanted to take it off-roading or out in the mountains rather than drive their kids to school and do family things. Next we drove the Highlander and my husband told me that he was very impressed with how sleek it actually looked in person. He said he was expecting something more of a soccer mom van/wagon style and this didn't strike him that way at all. We had our 10 month old son in the car and he instantly fell asleep on the drive in the highlander. The drive was smooth, the interior wasn't as roomy as the 4-Runner but it had a third row seat which we wanted, back up camera, and touch screen audio and blue tooth controls on the wheel. We took this car to San Diego to stay with my inlaws for a few days and my nephew, husband, son, mother in law, father in law and myself all fit in the car comfortably. When we go out of town to San Diego or somewhere around that distance, we only fuel up once for the trip (assuming it's a few days and not a week or so). I drive this car to work every day, and around town, to the neighboring towns about once a week, and I only have to fuel up every other week or so. And now with baby #2 on the way, I have no doubts that this car will be able to continue safely holding all of my precious cargo without making us cramped for space.",pos
Very nice car.  Rides incredibly smooth.   Quiet,pos
Shop around before buying.  Different dealers have slightly different promotions and pricing.,pos
Only owned this new car for a few weeks but are very pleased with everything this car offers. Will be taking our first long road trip in a few weeks.,pos
"After hours of combing through Consumer Reports, various websites and test driving SUVs, we chose the Toyota Highlander. This is our 2nd Highlander.  It is our main, family of 4, vehicle. We had a base model 2005 Highlander for 12 years & loved it. It was very reliable as we pretty much only had to do routine maintenance. Our 2016, we purchased, was previously a lease vehicle. The safety features are fantastic. The back seat has captain chairs which my 2, 5'10"" tall, teenagers love. The 2nd & 3rd row has more leg room than our previous model. We only use 3rd row seat for short trips. Overall, the 2016 feels roomier than our 2005. I'm not a fan of the plastic cargo cover in the back. I'd rather have carpet to help keep things from sliding around. Also, the storage center between the front seats is awkward/bulky. The tech features are easy figure out & use. The ride feels smoother & is quieter than our previous Highlander. We test drove the 2017 Honda Pilot at least 4 times & liked it too, but the tech had zero knobs & was not as easy as Highlander to figure out. The Pilot seemed to sit lower than the Highlander & the steering felt looser. In the end we purchased the Highlander, because we know it will be reliable for years to come & we wanted a sportier look.
*Update after 6 months. 
Still love our Highlander. However, I wish the automatic hatch would lift higher. I'm 5'5"" & have hit my head on it several times. I do push it higher manually when I remember.",pos
"A great value, safe car. I live on the side of a Mountain. The grade going up my drive is probably 60 degree along with a few curves. The car has amazing down hill assist to negotiate down steep hills and of course my drive. AWD and  4 wheel drive additional feature: just tried in the snow on my steep drive and did not slip once. I would highly recommend this car. I had 2  VW Touareg's, but they were not as reliable on the roads I travel as the 2016 Toyota in snow, ice and mountain terrain. The things I do not like about the car: I am 5'4 and getting positioned in the car means I am constantly moving the seat back and forth. When it rains, the configuration of the door and windows does not shed water when door is initially opened,  steering is so fine tuned you don't feel the roughness of the road consequently ---takes a little getting use to...finally... I would like a more realistic back up camera  (not a fish eye camera )- positioned where the rain drops and snow  do not sit on camera lens distorting the backup view. But as far as safety, I will deal with the insignificant to enjoy the significant safety features.  I need Safety first. The 2016 Highlander  is a great value for the money and the safety features sold me 100%.  .. "" NC Mountains""",pos
This car is way better then my last great ride smooth engine best decision I made in a car,pos
"Great SUV, fantastic to drive, insulates you from the road and traffic noise. Just one concerning trait, heard this strange buzzing noise coming from underneath the rear end about 5 hours after it was turned off and parked in the garage. No idea what it was so Googled it; ""This is the sound of a fuel evaporation leakage check and, it does not indicate a malfunction"" was the answer in several searches. Sure enough it is in the Owner's manual as well. Would have been nice if the dealership would have pointed this out when they were explaining the other features at time of purchase.",pos
This is a nice ride.  I traded in an Avalanche pickup that was deluxe. The Highlander is as comfortable as the Avalanche and has as much interior room.  It has a lower ground clearance so off-roading is not possible but the highway ride is smooth!  I've had the Highlander over one year and it's still a joy to drive.,pos
"We travel to Florida for the winter each year and wanted a vehicle that we could load all our stuff plus two cats and a kayak and drive comfortably.   The Highlander hit the spot.   What I most like about this SUV is simple the way it drives.  It's smooth, quiet and comfortable.  It has a very solid feeling on the highway.   Visibility is not the greatest which is typical of any SUV but the blind side monitors are great for lane changing.  I would not have this vehicle without this feature.   The Toyota Entune tech package with NAV, is fantastic and easy to setup and use.    Only a couple of minor complaints with this SUV.  When you open the glove box door it hits the passenger in the legs.  It needs to be raised.   Also I bought the Limited version believing it had most everything I wanted, and I was a little disappointed to discover that it didn't have automatic high beam/dimming.    Other than that, it has about everything my Cadillac DTS has on it.    I looked at 3 other vehicles, the Pathfinder which was a nice vehicle but was a bit noisy, and the new GMC Acadia which was also quite nice but overpriced - about $8,000 more than a comparatively equipped Pathfinder.  Our local dealer, Capital Toyota in Chattanooga was very hospitality and easy to deal with.  I highly recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for a mid sized SUV.",pos
"I really love the SUV, it handles like a nice sedan rather than a truck. I only wish Toyota would put ""Leather seats"" in more of their models.  I have had those seats in all my vehicles for over 20 yrs and I miss that.",pos
Consider buying LE Plus AWD...especially if there's a chance of moving to snow country.,pos
"The Highlander is big, it has three rows of seats, however it does not feel like a large car when you are driving. The size does make it comfortable for adults, the 2nd row seats have plenty of room even for larger/taller people.  I really enjoy the ""shelf"" located slightly below the dashboard.  It makes a great place to put your phone, glasses, laundry ticket, etc, you get the picture.  It also has a large center console for bigger items.  The onboard tech is OK, the Toyota Entune system has a couple of OK features including notification of txt's and emails - although you cannot read them while driving but you can send a standardized response. You also have apps for Open Table, sports, stocks, movie tickets and a few others.  The stereo, although listed as a premium system is not very powerful and the tone/quality is fair at best.  The NAV is OK to use, the voice activation commands work best for making bluetooth phone calls but using it to NAV or perform other functions is mediocre. The motor sounds fine at most speeds but I do hear a ""whine"" or higher pitched tone from time to time that I do not care for.  Also, the Homelink function is difficult to program.  I have succeeded in getting button 1 programmed but the other buttons are not working.  (I have not contacted Toyota yet on this issue) The pros are the nice size, overall styling and functionality, the cons are a couple of extra noises, avg stereo and mediocre grade leather on the seats. My net opinion, I would buy this car again and would recommend it to you!

Updating the review after 6 months ownership;  I was able to get the Homelink programmed.  Interesting it worked when I tried it and was miles from my garage and used a handheld remote and for no apparent reason the programming took!  The car still gets roughly 20 MPG and have had no ""squeaks or rattles"".  I stick with my earlier recommendation and would buy the car again if given a choice.",pos
I love this model. However I had to replace rear right shock assembly because oil leaking. I noticed that some unuaual banging sound when I cross over some step or safety block. I replaced it and I am happy now. Hopefully no other issues with my brand new car.,pos
"Wow, everytime I get in this vehicle to go anywhere I am blown away by the quiet, the comfort and the amazing ride.  So happy with my decision.",pos
"I'm used to truck-based SUV's having owned 2 Toyota 4Runners, a Mercedes G-500, and a bunch of  first gen FJ-40 Landcruisers, so to drive the Highlander is almost effortless. The one thing I have to worry about is the long length and wheelbase, which is longer than any of the other cars that I have ever owned. On the other hand, if I keep the mindset that I'm driving a truck or bus, like I used to do for a living, I'll be OK. But I have have never driven anything as smooth and comfortable!",pos
"I had a wonderful experience when purchasing my Toyota.   The employees were very professional and experienced.  I traded my 2014 Terrain for the Highlander and the difference is unbelievable.  This is the quietest car I have ever had.  It handles great and the 6 cylinder is really good.  I am still learning all the electronics, but the keyless start is amazing.  Interior is beautiful.  Everything is well made.  There is plenty of leg room for my 6'6"" husband.  He loves to drive the car.  He thinks I made the right decision purchasing the Highlander Limited.  It was a few thousand dollars more than the XL and worth the difference.  We have always bought GM vehicles and this is our first Toyota.  It is much better than the Terrain.",pos
"Very nice vehicle, rides great and comfortable.   looks great",pos
I test drove over ten SUV's and by far thought the Toyota Highlander was the best value of any!,pos
"My last highlander was a 2008 Limited and had 130,000.  The only repairs it ever had were new tires and brakes.  I am hoping this one is the same.  I love the automatic high beams, cruise control that adjusts to traffic, and the bluetooth.  The touch screen is easily navigated and home screen keeps all the important and most used apps at your finger tips.  My sons love the heated back seats and the headrest mounted DVD players (dealer installed but not made by Toyota).  I was hoping for more interior room, the MPG is also not great at 19-20 average (and most of my driving is on country roads, not stop and go traffic).  I thought after 8 years Toyota would have done a little better.  Also DO NOT get Toyota installed remote start!  It only works from about 20 feet from the car.  If you are inside and the car is outside forget about it!  It also shuts the engine off when you get in and you need to restart.  But overall, I LOVE my new Highlander!",pos
"I needed a 8 passenger SUV for my family with growing kids, their friends, sports, activities, etc...  I narrowed it down to the redesigned Honda Pilot and the Toyota Highlander XLE AWD.  I reviewed many customer, and on-line expert reviews, and for me there was no contest... the winner was the Toyota Highlander XLE.  From looks and comfort to performance and safety/technology.  All of my past five SUV's all drove like trucks, but not the Highlander, this one drove like a Lexus!  It is definitely a head turner that I'm proud to drive.  I got the Blizzard White which is not your standard white, it's a more luxurious color for sure.  I'm 6'2' tall and I have plenty of room in the drive seat, which is not the case in a lot of SUV's.  Just to be picky...I wish it had a few more USB ports, and blind side indicators for this model, which is the more popular middle of the road model.  I now have 40,000 miles with no maintenance issues whatsoever. Great vehicle overall, good in snow, and so much fun to drive!  You will not be disappointed with the Toyota Highlander which is rated number one for a reason!!!",pos
I love the quietness of the engine and the cost savings I am experiencing with my hybrid vehicle. The ride is so smooth and it handles well.,pos
Study Consumer Reports testing of the several SUVS and do a test drive of at least 3 makes.  I am sure you will find the Highlander stands out as the best in  performance and comfort.  I would highly recommend this vehicle to any one.,pos
"We love this car! Such a smooth, comfortable ride. The 3rd row seats 3, which is awesome when carting around the kids and their friends. The technology is easy to use and so convenient.",pos
"I've had three Highlanders. And there is absolutely nothing NOT to love. Style, comfort, reliability...all good qualities of a nice SUV. No complaints at all !!!!",pos
"Have been a loyal Honda consumer since 1992 and this is my first Toyota.  Perfect transition from a 2007 Honda Odyssey to the Highlander.  Pros:  Comfort, ride, minimal road noise, interior room, back up camera, blind spot monitoring, audio options, iPhone interface.  Cons:  With 3rd row up, limited cargo space; gas mileage generally 19-20 mpg.   I was so reluctant to give up my van after 16 years' of Honda Odyssey's, but time to move on from the minivans.  Other vehicles we considered were:  Honda Pilot, Acura MDX, Ford Explorer and Infiniti QX60.  Glad we did not spend the extra money for the Acura and Infiniti.",pos
I like my newly purchase Toyota Highlander.  The 6 cylinder is quiet and has excellent pick-up.  The interior is comfortable.  Workmanship is of top notch.  I have not found anything negative on my SUV.,pos
"Have only driven 1,000 miles with our new Highlander, but we love everything about this car.",pos
"We purchased the Highlander XLE and realized after driving it for a couple of weeks that it did not have some of the safety features that we really wanted.  We traded up to the Highlander Limited AWD after 3 weeks of driving the XLE.  And, we love it!  The Limited has blind-spot monitoring, a back-up camera with alarms and several different traction modes. This is a great family vehicle although, the third seat is tight.  I would not recommend the third seat for older kids for any long trips.  The ride is quiet, the interior is comfortable and the exterior is a classy!",pos
"Bought the car 3 weeks ago. Paid 37,400 on a 40,840 sticker XLE white with leather.Car is comfortable AC is cold both front and rear . Have owned toyota before and played a big part in the purchase. Dependable and reliable. Turned off the ECO button feels the car is being pulled with it on. Gas mileage about 22 hwy 18 city could be better.touch screen has many features takes a few days to get used to. Side mirrors seems large and sometimes block view on turns.",pos
"I have had this car for three months. It is the best decision I made. It's road handling, fuel economy, cabin noise are all great. The power is adequate. Excellent storage. Also, it had the best handling and ride quality among all the cars I test drove (Pilot/Mazda CX9).",pos
"Pros: Rock solid look, feel and handling. Calm-instilling, smooth, quiet ride. Sensible, simple, intuitive controls. Luxury car look, feel and performance at a below-luxury price and with lower cost regular fuel! Safe, effective all wheel drive and active safety systems.  Cons: Smaller than ideal cargo space.  Very tight third row -- for young children or emergency, short trips only. Lane departure sensor is a little too sensitive. Navigation slightly less intuitive and useful than other controls and systems in this vehicle and than navigation systems in other vehicles and after-market or cell phone based systems.  Overall: An easy 5 out of 5 stars!  This vehicle should be on anyone's list for a mid-size SUV with a third row seat.  There is a wide variety of option levels with corresponding wide variety in cost so it can fit into many budgets whether you choose the top end to compete with luxury vehicles as we ultimately did or a ""lower"" level which can compete with almost any but the smallest, compact SUVs on price (which we also considered).",pos
Great all around suv.  Check if you like the front seats,pos
"After the first drive and really settling into the car, it is very smooth easy drive.  The navigation system is not that great and I am considering switching it out, but overall I am extremely satisfied with our car.  It doesn't seem to be as heavy as the Honda Pilot that I was test driving and it was the little touches that really won me over on purchasing this car.",pos
"Still love it
One year later still love it. Runs good and not a single issue",pos
"I love my Highlander!!!! It's attractive, quiet, reliable, comfortable. I've had three Highlanders and have kept going back for more!!! The only thing that I don't like are the colors of the new ones. The Silver looks like a tin can silver, and the Pre Dawn Mica is more brown than it appeared online. Other than that there is nothing to complain about.",pos
"The car drives & handles very well, luv it, my first Toyota, thanks for making quality vehicles !!",pos
"This has very excellent road handling, very comfortable ride. so far I am getting around 20mpg combined.",pos
"ride is quiet and smooth, and has an interior that really looks and feel roomy (have 2-row captain chairs).  handsome styling too.  handles good on the road.",pos
My Highlander is the top of the line with every option. It is very lux and actually an easy replacement for my previous SUV a BMW X5. It is lighter by 1000 lbs and has 45 fewer bhp. The performance is comparable and the quality is superior!  I'm looking forward to not having $3000 repair bills to replace an alternator and then an air conditioning compressor.,pos
"I needed enough cargo space for a wheelchair on occasion, and golf bags. The cargo space works perfectly. The air cooled seats are just right for Florida as is the zoned air. I can't say enough good things about this car. Great!",pos
Meets it's write up,pos
"We replaced our 2006 Highlander about a month ago. Actually we kept it also we liked it so much. 
The new Highlander is fabulous. Super comfortable. Great acceleration. Very solid tight ride. Spacious interior. Great for long trips which we take often. CR gives it it's highest rating for a reason.
Some of the items above were given an ok or N/A rating because we haven't had the car long enough, except the navigation which actually is just OK. This seems to be the case on many of the built in systems.",pos
"Extremely comfortable.  Good looking.  Proven reliability.  This SUV is great.  Zero complaints.  I did not like the Honda Pilot interior, nor the past reliability, nor the ""new"" engine, transmission of the Pilot.  Still zero complaints after almost 2 years, 22,000 miles.",pos
"Don't trade in if you can sell to a private party. Find  an enet sales person who wants to make a sale, and not at $450 or 750 below MSR-deal and be ready to walk away if their feet are in concrete. Search the whole state for your car, it could likely be to your interest and let them know if the price is right you'd make the trip. Test drive before you start seriously looking. Be ready for the finical officer he's got a ton of service and extended contracts and remember you have an option under Toyota's warranty and road service to buy any other extended contracts before their's end.",pos
"This is a solid buy. Comfy, adequately powerful, good road manners. Steering is a little vague with too much assistance, but not numb like domestic competitors. This Limited model has virtually all the bells and whistles. Recommended without question.
Update:  Now with 19,000+. The Highlander has performed very well.  It's stable and comfortable on the road. Well mannered and easy to maneuver in town.",pos
"Excellent purchase. Handles like a van, not like a truck, and similar to a sedan. The leather and interior is excellent. Kids love it.",pos
"This is a nicely designed vehicle, howver, the Ipod/MP3 device is visible when connected. It would be great if a device could remain in place and somehow be concealed or out of view. The console cup holders can be annoying at times, because the holding clip is unstable and keeps popping out. They really don't hold small or medium sized cups too well. Platinum models should also have automatic folding mirrors when the vehicle is parked.

I just love the panoramic moon roof and luxurious interior!",pos
I am loving it!,pos
"This is my second Highlander. The first was an 2003 LE. I recently gave it to my daughter with 139000 miles on it. Because I loved my 03 so much, we decided the new car would also be a Highlander. This time we went all out and purchased the Limited Platinum. This car has 4 owners manuals! I've made it through them all. This car has all the bells and whistles! I particularly am enjoying the blind spot warning, lane departure and the cruise control feature that keeps you a safe distance from the car in front of you. I must admit this took a little getting used to, but now I truly appreciate the way the car speeds up or slows down on its own while using the cruise feature. The lift gate is also easy to operate. You must use the operating handle, but you don't need to manually unlock the door first if you are keeping the key in your purse. I do like the easy lock/unlock features on the doors as well. The interior is very attractive, spacious and comfortable. I love that I can fit my tote style handbag safely away in the deep storage unit between the front seat! It's also wide enough for me to fish around for anything I need in my bag, and there is also roo, for me to store all my favorite CDs in there as well. The back seat captains chairs are very comfortable and ride very well. There are retractable window shades for added comfort. This is great for traveling with babies! We haven't even used the third row seats, but they are ready when needed. The cargo area without the third row is very spacious! Four adults could easily travel with all their luggage for at least a week or more including beach chairs and coolers! The entune system is great! It has local weather, traffic,Bluetooth pairing for listening to your favorite music on your phone, or on the apps you can install such as i❤️radio, Pandora, and others. You get a three month subscription to Sirius. The navigation system will not allow you to get lost! It reconfigures if you miss a turn without making you feel bad, it simply and redirects you without that annoying ""recalculating"" you get with other system. I love the sunny interior when you unshaded the cabin with the panoramic moon roof. I just love my new car, and am looking forward to many years of pleasurable driving!",pos
"I just love my Highlander.  Leased a 2105 XLE but after driving it for a few months I found that I longed for the Limited edition.  I found that I prefer the captain chair seating along with all of the safety features that come with the Limited Platinum edition.  Not only do I love the safety features, it is really awesome to have the panoramic sunroof.  I live in Southern California where the weather is beautiful year round so I opted to not get the AWD version.  My only complaints are the price of the vehicle. It is quite pricey but for the features you get it is a WHOLE lot cheaper than the equally equipped luxury vehicles, such as Audi Q7 or the Infinit Qx6 which are  cars that  I was originally considering.  For the price point of this vehicle I also would prefer if the side view mirrors would automatically fold in without me having to fold them in manually.  I love the entune system which works quite well with my LG V10 cellphone which I also LOVE!  Being that I had the standard audio system on the 2015 Highlander XLE, I am able to speak to the quality of the JBL system I now have.  I am strictly a Pandora and bluetooth user and I will say the sound quality is far superior to the system that comes standard on the XLE model.  So, I can say that I like the JBL.  But, then again, I am not a radio listener and my music has HD quality because of the cellphone that I have.  I absolutely love my Highlander and since I am no longer leasing, I will be keeping 2016 Limited Platinum Highlander for many many years to come.",pos
Couldn't be happier with the car! Exceeds expectations!,pos
"I have had the car for over a two years now the car continues to be great, it is great on mileage and the spacing in the car is just what I need for my mom that drives around carrying kids from one event to another.",pos
"I needed an SUV to cart around my three children and all of their friends but didn't want a minivan. The Toyota Highlander is the perfect vehicle for us. I have the AWD version so that gas mileage isn't amazing but it is good and the handling in adverse weather conditions is excellent. I got a great deal on the vehicle at $34,000 and they seem to maintain their value. A big deciding factor for me is the reliability of the car. I wanted a vehicle that I won't constantly have to be bringing to the shop to fix ""wear and tear"" items. I don't have the time or energy to waste on going back and forth to the mechanic. When considering this vehicle I talked to my mechanic (that I love and trust) and he said that if everyone owned Toyotas, he'd be out of a job. He stated that Toyotas regularly come into the shop and leave with only scheduled maintenance. The exterior styling could have been more unique for my tastes but it is classy and pretty sleek so I'll take it. The interior even at the LE Plus trim level is excellent. It is stain resistant cloth through the middle of the seats but trimmed with synthetic leather. After a month of driving it, my kids haven't managed to stain anything yet. I also love that the middle seats slide forward (without having to remove the booster seats) to access the rear seats. You can also slide the middle seats forward or backward in many different positions to allow for more or less leg room in the third row. Having 8 seats is such a blessing. I find that I often keep only two seats up in the third row to give myself plenty of cargo space. I am looking forward to driving this car for many years to come.",pos
Quality throughout entire vehicle. Should maintain value for years to come.,pos
"Comfort, quietness, smooth ride (probably due to being new).  Suitable for us as a family of four.  Great travel vehicle.  Planning to keep this in the family for at least 15 years until the girls go to college.  Only drawback, when your flooring the gas pedal the Highlander has a hard time figuring out when to shift to the next gear.  I noticed that when you floor the car, it will pull hard but the RPM is revving high up to 5000 RPM but the gear doesn't shift to the next fast enough.  I don't know about other owners, but that is weird.  Usually when you floor a vehicle, it should only take a second of so to shift 1-2-3-4-5.  My RPM sits up in the 5000 range for about 2 seconds then drops to the next gear.  Overall, satisfy with purchase.",pos
Compare it's features and price with similar vehicles by other respected manufacturers,pos
I traded in my 2005 Honda CRV which I drove for 11 years and bought a Highlander XLE.  I love this car!  The ride and comfort are wonderful.  I have the two separate seats in the second row which are comfortable and roomy.  The technology is easy to set up and use.  Love how the audio bluetooth works with my music downloads on my I-phone. Toyota has won me back with this quality vehicle.  Great value.  Just a pleasure to drive.   I haven't had it long enough to comment on reliability but I have high expectations for Toyota quality.  I am 65years old and looking forward to driving my new Highlander in my retirement years.,pos
"I bought my Highlander a month ago from Toyota of Wilmington and it was a great experience and vehicles. I love the performance, features, and  style of the highlander.",pos
"I needed to replace my 2007 4Runner Trail with a new vehicle that would get me, passengers, the dog, and goods, through the snow, the mud, and the dust to my camp in central Maine.  I also needed a safe car that I could maneuver on the highways up and down the East Coast, get decent mileage, and have a solid array of safety features.  Unfortunately the new 4Runner does not have adaptive cruise control, blind spot/cross lane warnings, crash avoidance systems, etc. I refused to pay an extra $10,000 for the Lexus.  So I ended up with the AWD Highlander Platinum Limited and its extensive array of safety features.  Obviously, there is a big difference between driving a truck-based and a car based SUV, such as the Highlander.  In this respect, I don't miss the 4Runner Trail.  We'll see when I'm stuck in high snow whether I miss the 4WD.  But for now, I'm thrilled driving the Highlander.  While the interior looks massive, it isn't a big car.  While I thought about the Ford Explorer for a couple of days, as I liked the parking assist and the safety features involving the front of the car, I opted for the Toyota because of quality assurance and the cheaper price.  

I have driven it for two months, including nine-hour trips up and down the East Coast.  I have stopped worrying about changing lanes because of the safety features.  I was able to carry more goods than the 4Runner.  And on the last trip North during a cold winter's day, I averaged over 25 mpg...with only 1500 miles on the odometer.  Who knows what I'll get during the summer after it has been broken in.  My personal list of likes besides all the safety items: a comfortable seat, a decent sounding audio system, a nice interior design, especially the shelf in the front to carry wallets, phones, etc., the flip-up back window, the car handling, the automatic headlights/bright beams, and the automatic windshield wipers.  I only wish they had included front parking radar.  I am one of the last to have a Windows phone, which doesn't quite mesh with the Entune system...but it works.  While I miss the rugged 4Runner capability, but I now have AWD and all types of safety mechanisms that will keep me safe.  So far, it exceeds expectations.",pos
Everything you could imagine you would want or need in a vehicle is here. You don't have to get a Lexus for luxury.,pos
"I traded in my Toyota Sienna for the Highlander XLE AWD. I was concerned about losing too much space, but I didn't.  I do miss the sliding doors.  It was nice not to have doors in the way when you're loading and unloading kids.  If you've had a mini man, you will understand that.  Drives so smooth.  Far less road noise.  With my radio going, I feel like I'm in my own little world.  The broadcast radio doesn't sound super, but when you play from bluetooth or XM, it sounds great!  I opted for the black leather interior.  it's stitched with brown thread and there's also some brown leather accents on the doors and dash.  Super stylish, manly enough for my husband, but still very chic for me.  Love the screen!  Wish I was able to add my own apps to the entune suite (like Spotify) since I already subscribe.  You cannot access any of the entune apps without subscription.  Bummer.  Back up camera is nice has a wide angle. Something very important to me since I've have had two cervical fusions and my neck does not crank around easily to back up.  This is a nice helper and makes me more at ease.  Think we got a decent deal and I love it.  If I were to change things, they'd be very minor.  Happy with my purchase!!",pos
"I was driving a Toyota Sienna so I was used to more cargo space and a different console setup between the front seats. The console in this car is so big and tall that you could put a baby in it. It is hard to get to the seat belt latches next to it, which means wide people should not buy this car because you will find using the seat belt difficult. I am an average size person and I have to get my hand squeezed down beside the console to unlatch the seat belt.
My audio system LCD also seems to have a bug in it when it is cold. It is non-responsive for up to 15 minutes of driving. You can only change the volume until it warms up--nothing else, no radio station changes etc. None of the buttons beside the panel work either. When it does wake it, sometimes it doesn't beep, but most of the time it beeps and often changes the station to the one at the bottom of the list. Then it might decide to go into Search Station mode. It may beep a number of times and you have to try to stop the Search so it won't replace all of your stations.  Of course, it wasn't cold when I took it to the dealer and they couldn't help me. Every morning and evening is different in how it acts when it ""wakes up"".
It drives beautifully and handles well on snow and ice here in Michigan for the month I have owned it. The third seat will do for kids or small people for a short ride. It is a big step up to get back there.",pos
We just bought a new 2016 Toyota Highlander Limited.  The design and technology of the 2016 Highlander are dramatically improved from the 2011 Highlander we traded in.  We love the new look and significant improvements included with the new technology package.  I was also surprised at the great trade in price we received for 2011 Highlander.,pos
"SUV has a bit of torque issues on front wheel drive on wet surface acceleration and tight corners from stopping position,wish I had bought awd...a bit to much body roll,perhaps se model would be better for that problem,but like the SUV easy out and in for hurting back,looks good,nice sound system,not crazy about rear captain chairs a bench seat would be smarter for me as I don’t like groceries sliding through with third row down,other than that probably would buy a awd ,SE.",pos
"Toyota is by far the best at reliability and service cost. I've had this SUV for three years using it solely for long business trips, approximately 35,000 miles per year. I have had very few maintenance issues and have had the vehicle serviced in various states because the service intervals happened when I was away from base. Invariably, I received great care at reasonable prices with out feeling ripped off as I do when I take my wife's Mercedes in or the BME's I've had in the past. Drives great and costs are reasonable.",pos
One of the quietest rides I have ever experienced.  Great road car!,pos
This is a great car.                                      1. I would like to know if anyone knows if I can change the setting for the fob for it to make a noise when I lock the car?          2. How do I change the setting so I can leave my car running but also lock it? [contact information removed],pos
"Nothing, it's a Toyota!!!!😉",pos
Not cheap but well made still a good value a 20year car,pos
"I really love this vehicle and will consider buying or leasing another one when my current lease is up. Some concerns I have is the third row seating will not accommodate an adult, I would like to see Toyota extend the length of the vehicle by 6"" to make the third row of seating comfortable for an adult. It would also be nice if the captain chairs in the second row were ventilated like the front seats. Also the headlights need to be converted to  halogen bulbs because current lights aren't bright enough.",pos
"No way would I let this car go but, I leased it and want to came out under the lease, Great Great car nothing wrong with it,",pos
Great all around car.  Very pleased.  Only wish would be for the sunroof to be a little larger,pos
"We bought our 2015 LE V6 AWD over two years ago. The reliability, comfort and looks all have been great. My wife loves this vehicle and she uses it for her daycare & our family. I just wish that the cloth material inside didn't get dirty so easily. Some other interior materials are a bit cheap too. I drive a LS430 so I guess I'm a bit spoiled but the materials inside my work Ford Fusion are better.  Great SUV overall.",pos
"We've had this car for two years.  We have two kids under 5 years old.  We have loved this car, its styling, its comfort, and its reliability.  Pros: Very comfortable, great drive, good handling, first 20k maintenance included, reliable, very solid all the way around in every category, awesome tray under dashboard.  Cons:  Toyota still seems to be struggling a little with inside aesthetics, mixing colors that don't match, etc.  The third row seat is difficult to get to and very uncomfortable - Probably only viable for kids 7-13 age range, with even a small booster seat in the car it takes up more width than allotted for the seat so you can not take advantage of the 60/40 split with two in the car, you pay a premium price for features where you can get much more for the same money on a car like a Nissan Pathfinder (but this car handles better *Toyota that is*), small issue with blind spots as found in many cross overs in this category, gas millage much worse on highway and city than listed.       Overall great vehicle and we would buy it again.",pos
"I purchased a 2015 Highlander Limited on September 30, 2015-I absolutely loved the vehicle.  This vehicle was a replacement for my 2003 Highlander in which I logged over 180,000 satisfied miles.  It was amazing how far this vehicle has come since then with regards to design and features.  The new vehicle was extremely luxurious and had exceptional driving ability. 
On October 20, 2015 I was taking my three boys to soccer practice (ages 6,7 and 11) when I was hit head-on by a drunk driver in a 25 mph zone five minutes from our home.  The driver of the other vehicle, who was travelling at 87 mph and managed to slow to 70 mph before striking me in the front driver side, was killed instantly.  Me and my three children were able to exit the vehicle and walk away!  This is true and real -world testament to the Toyota Highlander's quality and safety.  The Glassboro Police Department (assigned to investigate the crash,was impressed with the construction of the vehicle and how it held up under such extreme conditions and force.  It is my understanding that the Chief of Police actually wrote a letter to Toyota as a testimonial to the vehicles safety features.  He actually had a small quote in one of the numerous articles attesting to how well the vehicle withstood the collision.  
Needless to say that as soon as I was able to, I walked into Toyota of Turnersville and purchased the exact same vehicle, only a different color-slight superstition.  My children love our Highlander and refer to it as the ""safe car.""  This car is definitely top of the line in its' segment across the board.  Please keep in mind, the price is relatively high (comparable to some ""luxury"" SUVs) and there is comparatively less wiggle room with the price; however, you get what you pay for with this vehicle.  Luxury level amenities and comfort, high level of performance and reliability and top of the line safety.",pos
Look for used market- heavy new price to pay- worth getting a year old,pos
"Because the SUV is in such high demand , there is not a lot of room for haggling on price.  Excellent vehicle , looks great, & handles nicely.  Definitely glad I purchased this vehicle.",pos
The 2015 Toyota Highlander Limited is great. The only thing I would change is the external driver and passenger mirrors. They are very large and create a blind spot. Everything seems great so far-had the SUV about one month.,pos
Always owned a 4 cylinder vehicle... this is just a dream come true.,pos
No issues after 1 year of ownership. However getting in and out of the 3rd row seat is very bad. 3rd row usage limited but then again this is no mini van.,pos
"The Highlander is a great mix of size, comfort and performance. It's a smart value and easily competes with other similar sized vehicles.",pos
"Great vehicle! My only complaint on interior is passenger side seat does not go very far back and the seat is really high. Electric controls are great but seat does not go low enough. My dad is 6'2"" and it's very uncomfortable for him to sit in passenger seat. He said it's a short persons car! Also, no incentives or any breaks on price because they said they know these sell regardless. Said it's their best seller so basically too bad. Gas mileage is comparable for this size vehicle. I love this vehicle more than my Acura I had!!",pos
"Quiet, smooth and well made/mannered. Eats up miles with little fatigue on the driver.

Interior seems a bit more cheaply made than either the Honda Pilot or the Buick Enclave that I have owned prior. Buick CXL cost close to $50k and Honda had so much road noise on the freeway you almost had to scream to have a conversation. Unless you have Mercedes money Quit looking and go buy the Highlander. 22k no issues. I have towed a few trailers and the vehicle did the job OK, however expect  a mpg penalty.",pos
"My greatest complaint is the Manuals for the Highlander and the Navigation with aids are not updated to current models.  My Highlander Manual referred me to a page in which the compass was located in rear view mirror.  After an exhausting search of the Manuals I emailed Toyota Customer Service and two days later I get info that there is not a compass in the rear view mirror.  I am sure there are other shortcomings in the over 1100 pages of manual, however, updates should be done when the year changes on the vehicle.  
On the positive side, the suspension is great, the cabin in quite, and vehicle as a whole far exceeds any criticism I read before purchasing this vehicle.
I remain overwhelmed with the volume of info with manuals.  So many things I have simply given up on as I don't need them for the operation of the vehicle",pos
"Favorite things: 
Fully Loaded with options seen with luxury brands but much lower in cost.
Top Safety Plus pick with the pre-collision safety system (only available on the limited platinum)
Every one loves the panoramic sunroof!
Easy to drive, great turning radius for its size.
Kids love the space in the rear seats.

Things that could be better:
Fuel efficiency has been worse than I expected, running about 17 MPG in mixed use.
Not too fond of the Entune/Navigation system.  We still end up using our favorite map app on our phone instead of Toyota's version.",pos
"We purchased a 2015 Platinum back in March to replace an an Enclave with over 140K miles. Loved the Enclave, but my wife just wanted a change so we settled on the Highlander. The car performed flawlessly for 7K miles until it was involved in a front-to-side collision. The entire front end was taken out. This occurred at approximately 40 mph and there were no injuries. The car was repaired and once again performed flawlessly until my wife was hit by a drunk-driver last week. She swerved to avoid a head-on crash and the entire left side was taken out. Both vehicles were traveling at approximately 40 mph, and once again, no injuries. We don't know if this will be repaired or totaled, but either way we will be headed back to the dealer to get a new Highlander as soon as the dust settles.

We can't say thank you enough to the folks at Toyota for protecting our family during both of these unfortunate incidents.

I know there are a lot of choices out there in this class and price category, but if the Highlander is on your list, safety is a concern, and everything else adds up for you don't think twice.",pos
"I have been driving the Highlander for 2 weeks after my 2008 CR-V was totaled. 
I personally love it and I am enjoying every second in it. 
I am now getting ready to purchase one of my own but I decided to read the reviews first.
Well, there are all sorts of crazy reviews here and on other sites, things they write but which I know from first hand experience that are not accurate. 
Such as poor breaking, or sluggish acceleration, or this and that.
My point is that you not only need to take it out for a test drive, but rent one for a few days and see for yourself.
Has I not rented one I would have been put off by the reviews.",pos
"We are owners of a 2001 Sequoia. Since we don't need a vehicle that large any longer we decided to downsize to the Highlander. 
We obviously got a smaller vehicle but we still have the great Toyota design and quality. 
We purchased the car about 3 weeks ago and just took a road trip in it. Highway driving was a breeze. The quiet smooth ride was wonderful. 
The interior of the car is beautiful and comfortable. Obviously the 2015 Highlander has many more options than a 2001 Sequoia did. 
Bluetooth, controls on the wheel and the lane alert is great. There are plenty of USB ports and outlets for your electronics. 
All and all we are pleased with our decision to stay with Toyota. The 2001 Sequoia is still ours too! You can't beat Toyota for quality. 
Absolutely no complaints about this vehicle.",pos
"I was in a 3 car accident i was in the front of the accident and the car behind me was a toyota corolla my highlander and hardly any damage. The corolla on the other hand was totaled it was pretty bad. Honestly when they hit me it felt like someone backed up into me in a parking lot i hardly felt it. So, would i recommend this to anyone yes to everyone especially if you have a family. We are just a small family of 3 but, we have a dog so we wanted something big enough to separate the baby and the dog. So, we put a large dog cage where the 3rd row seating is we still are able to fit luggage. So if i were you i'd buy this vehicle!!!",pos
"I bought a new XLE AWD 4 months ago to replace my Sienna mini-van. The Highlander is more comfortable and handles well. However I find it disturbing that no matter how I drive the mileage varies less than 1 mpg. It does not matter if I drive 55 or 75 mph, run the AC or not, or drive in the city or on the highway. My mileage stays at 21.1 to 21.5 mpg. I do not have a lead foot when accelerating, There should be more variation in my mileage.",pos
"I'm a car owner that keeps my cars for years so when it was time to start shopping for my next car my first consideration was a car with a reputation for longevity, ease of ownership and quality. I'd honestly never thought of Toyota because it's so soccer mom-ish but I began to love the new styling every time I saw the new body style. I had heard that buying a Toyota would keep me in the car for at least 5 years headache free.
I've got almost 5000 miles on the car now and loved every minute I've spent in the car! My few less than positive comments follow:

1. The braking is almost too soft. I find myself pressing on the brake and startled when I'm coming too close to the car in front of me and then quickly pressing much harder to actually stop the car. I've done this several times now and can see it's a problem in the event I have to react to split second stopping. I feel like I need to take it to a empty parking lot and practice emergency stops so I can adjust to the really soft brake pedal.
2. I find the car has that lag when you stomp on the gas to accelerate into traffic from the on ramp. It almost feels like it LOSES energy when I step on the pedal then doesn't follow up with rapid acceleration but slogs into traffic which is frustrating. I don't know about torque and rpms and such but a V6 should have more power than this at a low speed to rapid acceleration, I thought.

I live in Colorado. When driving into the mountains it has plenty of power to climb the hills and the transmission is smooth and perfectly silent. I love the ability to take it out of auto D and switch the gears to slow my descent which is a necessity here.

I bought it in May so hope that this car is solid on snowy roads, that's why I went back into an SUV from a sedan. Last winter, I'd rent a AWD/4WD when driving to the mountains because I had a FWD sedan so when I needed a winter car I'd rent one. So, I compared the Nissan Pathfinder, the Buick Enclave and the Ford Explorer in true winter conditions. The Buick is a tank and grippy. I actually relaxed during a tricky winter drive in the Buick. Next in line was the Explorer which has the control to switch to ""snow"" and when I put that into play, it felt solid and reliable on slick, snow packed roads but still had a ""tinny"" feel, the opposite of a tank. The Nissan would hit a patch of snow pack and slide sideways making for a sickening experience among other really questionable build issues that convinced me this car is a non starter. Bottom line, I hope my Highlander feels solid like the Buick this winter.

The Buick has a pretty interior, lots of accent lighting and finishes in the cabin to make you feel like you're in a very expensive high end vehicle. The Highlander has a utilitarian interior cabin with just a few details to make it feel more like a car than a truck but it stills looks utilitarian. The center compartment is huge and I find I access it a lot like my purse...the tray has the things I need daily, and the ""bottomless"" part catches all the stuff that I leave in the car so I reach deep into it and rake through stuff to find what I'm looking for. It literally can conceal a large purse or your laptop case (and probably an airline carry on!) so it's useful for concealing things left in the car.

The sound system is just adequate, the range of sound is in the middle range and a narrow range at that, just adequate. 

The road noise is noticeable but acceptable.

The doors have a hollow sound when you shut them which is surprising.

The bluetooth speaker system tied to my phone is a muffled sound and coupled with road noise, it's underwhelming.

I chose the Highlander over the Buick because I felt like the Highlander is going to take me much further down the road with fewer repair/maintenance headaches but it was a close call between the two. The Toyota care program tilted my decision in it's favor. I'm all for someone else taking care of and paying for the regular maintenance for the first two years.

In town driving on mostly 35mph streets gets around 22; getting into stop and go drive time on interstate roads gets 24 and all out interstate driving at 75mph gets over 30. This is almost the same as my little 4cyl FWD sedan!

Bottom line, I'm hoping the car doesn't disappoint in true winter driving and I'm prepared to switch to winter tires to get the performance I need but I hope I don't have to spend the money and the time to switch tires twice a year. Everything else I'm overall content with and happy with my purchase.",pos
"Shiny, sculptured wheel covers are PLASTIC.  Installed in a manner that makes them easily damaged in minor curb encounter.  Cannot be repaired.  Cannot be bought alone as replacement.  Must buy $650 wheel and cover combo.  Unacceptable for a $40,000 car.

Wheel covers less important as time passes.  I dont know if 2017-18 uses different wheels?  Only one minor scrape since major wheel cover scrape in first year.

Navigation system voice recognition is still unreliable after a Toyota software upgrade about a year ago.  You can say 'black' and it recognizes 'white'.  Siri on my iPhone is super reliable.  Why cant Toyota do the same.  Voice recognition on my 2016 Ford F-150 is great.

Best thing about Toyota is longevity and reliability.  Much better resale value in later years.  Very seldom is there ever a reason to even visit the dealer.",pos
"I bought the base model LE Highlander and I am impressed with it, especially the suspension and drivetrain.  It is very smooth, quiet, and fuel efficient.  The four cylinder model has all the power you need, as I have never had a lead foot. I got great mileage above the EPA 20 -25 mpg advertised.  I averaged 26.2 mpg on a 3600 mile trip.  By keeping your foot out of the gas, you can achieve good results and still do 70-80mph on the Interstate.  It handles well and has good control in rain and mountains.  The climate control system is superior and I liked everything about this vehicle, except the cloth seats could be better quality.  My wife complained that the side mirrors are too big, but I like them as is.  As an old geezer I don't really care about the new computer technology gizmos and this base model suits my needs admirably.  After comparing numerous mid sized SUV models, I chose this vehicle because I have had good luck with Toyotas.  This is my fourth.
1/23/17  update: Had car for One and a half years.  12,600 on odometer.  Still impressed.  Only complaint is 4 cylinder on cruise control can't hold top gear on slight inclines at freeway speed.  It constantly power downshifts at 75-80mph, which keeps me honest and ticketless.  The comfort of the suspension is still awesome.  It is mainly my wifes car and she gets 18-22 mpg around the city 'cause she likes to juice it more than me.  Very satisfied owner.
1/26/18  update: Vehicle is still going strong.  24K on odometer.  Moved to the Rockies, car handles high altitude and snow very well.  No problems at all.  Still, it's a mom bomb that rides like a cadillac so I'm happy with it.  Starts right up in cold weather (-5 degrees), warms up quickly, and the snow feature keeps you from slipping on packed snow on the road.  I think front wheel drive is 90 percent as good as all wheel drive if you don't get too crazy with dirt roads, mud, and snow.  Overall, the vehicle is holding up very well with the limited abuse I subject it to.  It is a good value for a base model.",pos
"I've had my 2014 Higkander for 1 year, 8000 miles in, and I must say, it's near perfect. Not a single problem. Super smooth ride   Beautiful interior. Great acceleration, fantastic gas mileage. 
I have 2 caveats. My biggest issue is the second row. While  it is very roomy, and fits 3 across, the middle seat is not comfortable or practical. I have 3 kids, and liked it because I could fit 3 across in the second row, and load up the back with the third seat folded down for vacation and trips to the beach    However, the middle seat is not very comfortable. Because if the console, it protrudes out, is very hard, and is not practical for long trips. So I have to put my youngest in half the the third seat, and jam in luggage or beach stuff next to her. 
Besides that, this is a luxury vehicle for a very affordable price. 
Perhaps a bit more room behind the third seat would be nice too. 
Besides that, if your looking for a 3 row SUV that's classy, super smooth, and problem free, don't even think about getting anything else. 
I had a 2001 navigator before this.  While I loved the size, it was fraught with constant problems.   Expensive problems.",pos
"I bought my  15 highlander 3 days ago and I love it.   I got the XLE model . love the nav  ,smart key  and the sun roof. wife is happy so i'm happy.",pos
"Is it LEXUS or Toyota ? I bought the 2015 Highlander XLE AWD 3 weeks ago and have 600 miles. This is one fabulous vehicle and equals to my prior Mercedes ML 320 in ride comfort and increased leg room for adults in the first two rows along with room for 5 large 30 inch suitcases. It is difficult to find vehicles for 5 adults and large suitcases to go to airport.  My old Armada will not go into city parking garages. Pathfinder, Pilot, Acura MDX all have less leg room even for 5' 11"" drivers and seats are low,short and narrow. Enclave, Acadia - middle seat does not recline. Highlander quality is better than MDX and Thanks to Toyota for NOT BECOMING CHEAP. But third row is for muppets only. ",pos
"We got the 2015 Toyota Highlander Limited Platinum All-Wheel Drive. Of the 14 vehicles I've owned in my lifetime, this is the first one that we bought brand new, 0 miles. And we love it. There's a reason why the Toyota brand (despite the recalls from 2 years ago) keeps its image positively high.",pos
"We bought a 2015 and for the most part my husband and I really like it. It handles great and is easy to park. The interior is very nice looking and I like the shelf for cell phones and iPods. The issue we have is that while the driver's seat is very comfortable because it has so many adjustments the front passenger seat bothers both of our backs on long drives. It is fine for short trips. My husband is just under 6' and I am 5'5"". Even if we would have purchased the 4 way power passenger seat it still wouldn't support the lower back. My advice is if you make frequent trips over a couple hours long and your the passenger, you may want to look elsewhere for your next vehicle.",pos
"I just traded in my 2013 limited for a 2015 limited. Nice re-design Toyota! The drive is substantially better with a tighter turning radius, much less body roll when cornering and traction control along with a new 6 speed automatic transmission. The new styling also improved. The outside is much more stylish. The interior space has improved with more rear space for storage when the third row is in use. Seating improved offering more support along with ventilated front seats. Toyota has added 'one touch' windows to four instead of just the driver. Memory driver seats make me comfortable knowing I can get my exact setting after my wife drives the car.  ",pos
"I am 5ft 3 in tall, this car is way too big for me.
I feel like a mini kid, the seats are very large, controls are too far away, the seat will not go high enough for me.
the *biggest* problem is I need the seat forward and then to look out the front side windows, the side mirrors are very large and take up some viewing space..... making it very difficult to see if someone is about to cross in front of the car.
I have the 2105 Limited. I suggest you test drive this car in a lot of different areas/roads, check all forward blind spots.... no problem with rear or back side blind spots because it has the blind spot indicator
Radio is static, no mute button.
Navigation is very slow.
USB port is so far under & back, it's hard to insert.",pos
Cargo storage little small,pos
"Purchased the 2018 Elite after much research.  Very happy with our decision.  We were between the Pilot, Highlander, and Atlas.  The Highlander was smaller and didn’t have Apple CarPlay.  The Atlas, although nice, doesn’t have the track record the Highlander and Pilot have.  Although many reviews complain about the 9-speed transmission, we have been happy.  It does behave differently than a traditional transmission but it just takes time to get used to.  Very happy with how quiet the interior is at highway speed and the ride is great.  Very happy with the mileage we are getting so far.  We only have a few dislikes…the infotainment system is a little slow and not quite as intuitive as it could be.  I wish the auto start/stop feature could be disabled permanently instead of having to do it at each start-up.  Although it has the premium sound system, the bass is lacking but is sufficient for a family hauler.  I wish the Honda Link app would allow you to remotely start the car.  Rear entertainment system is great for trips with the kids.  I can use the HDMI input and use my phone to stream movies.  Overall very satisfied with our purchase.",pos
"We considered the cheaper and more tricked out Kia Sedona, but AWD and a more solid build won us over. This is a car worth holding for a long time (which helps with depreciation costs). Also considered the VW Atlas, but we just didn’t have confidence that it would last as long as the Honda. It’s also bigger than a Ford Explorer or a Toyota Highlander, but still feels very maneuverable. We love that it’s really not a fancy car, it’s solid and reliable and safe.",pos
"Great drivers aids except blind spot monitoring should be on all models, not just the Elite. Apple CarPlay is great, no costly upgrades for onboard GPS.  Also captains chairs should be an option for all models, not just elite. I didn’t want to pay $8000 more for most items I don’t want or need like 2nd row entertainment, on board GPS etc. It has the space of an Odessey, but not the soccer mom look.",pos
"Just traded in my 2005 Pilot for the new 2018 Pilot Elite.  There is definitely a learning curve to get used to the new technology.  The lane keeping assist and interactive cruise control take some getting used to, but after a week or so you get used to the alarm for steering required and automatic breaking.  Now I am used to the new tech and miss it when I drive my other car.  I am definitely much safer in the new Pilot.",pos
"An awesome SUV! It's comfortable and drives very smoothly. There is no reason to choose an European SUV over this amazing machine. I like everything about this car. If I were to change something on this SUV, the headlights should be more brighter and not that yellowish color. The lighting of these bulbs are on the low side and at night I would prefer to have better visibility. Other than that, it's superb!",pos
"I traded in my 17 Mazda 3 GT hatchback manual a few days ago for an 18 Honda Pilot EX-L with RES.  This is our 5th Honda(03 Pilot EX, 13 Honda Fit Sport, 13 Honda CRV EX-L, 17 CRV Touring).  I chose the EX-L trim because it was the closest match to my daily needs. I felt the ZF 9speed would drive me crazy with the auto shut off and all the nannies trying to assist me.  The 6 speed shifts smoothly and always is ready to drop a gear. Acceleration is plentiful, especially when merging onto the freeway.  The visibility is superb with low window sight lines and lots of glass.  The seating is awesome with plenty of room in the 3rd row.  The RES will get it use by my son and his friends on road trips.  The driving dynamics are pretty good but the steering is vague and the brakes don't give much feedback, but again this is a passenger hauler not a sports car.  I have had good experiences in the past with Honda's and this one should be the same. I perform all the maintenance on my vehicles and have never had any issues in the past 30 years.  Oil changes, filter changes, and tire rotations are about all I need to do with Honda vehicles.  The maintenance packages offered by our local Honda dealer are very expensive($3000+) and are essentially glorified oil changes.  If we decide to keep this more than 3 years, then I may buy a Honda Car extended warranty. Great job Honda!",pos
"The Car is ""great"". We are still learning all the technology in the car. The only downside is the auto engine shut off. The auto shutoff is really weird. We don't like the roughness in the - on/ off - function. The system can be shut off but will come on with each engine start.",pos
We bought a Civic Hatch and a Pilot and love them both. We gave our 2013 Honda Civic to our daughter and traded in our leased 2015 Toyota Highlander. Hands down the Pilot blows the Highlander away. It's so smooth and a dream to drive. We have always purchased our Honda's from Lindsay Honda. Their customer service is hands down the best. They make sure you are totally satisfied throughout the life of the car. Mike was great to work with. We took many hours trying to make our decision regarding which vehiclies were right for us. He is very knowledgable and answered all our questions. He also took time with us after the vehicles were purchased to go over all the features and connect our phones. We are 100% satisfied with our experience and would highly recommend buying a Honda from Mike at Lindsay Honda.,pos
Purchased the car September 2017 and have used in harsh winter weather. The car is excellent inside and out. Would recommend to anyone.,pos
Love the vehicle. A great choice.,pos
"Proud new owners of a 2017 Honda Pilot Touring. We got a GREAT deal on this vehicle because they had a bunch of 2018s on the lot and wanted to clear out the few 2017s that were left. Brand new for thousands less? Yes please! We traded in a 2012 Ford Explorer Limited. I liked my Explorer ... I LOVE my Honda. The 9 speed transmission doesn't bother me like it bothers some other reviewers; and I actually really like the side view camera. I originally had my heart set on a Toyota Highlander, but when we actually drove one I was very underwhelmed by it. Driving the Highlander I thought ""meh. It's nice, but I don't HAVE to have it."" It felt small inside, the third row was tiny, and it just didn't wow me like I thought it would. On a whim we decided to stop at the local Honda dealership on our way home just to take a look at the Pilots and maybe test drive one. I ended up falling in love with it as soon as I sat inside and we bought it that afternoon. It handles exceptionally well in snow and ice, even on our steep and often cumbersome driveway. I love the adaptive cruise, and I don't find the forward collision warning system overly sensitive as some other reviews have suggested. The Pilot is much roomier inside than both my Explorer and the Highlander we drove. I thought I wanted the Elite to get the middle row captain's chairs but then our salesman showed me the one-touch sliding seats and that sealed the deal. Our biggest issue was third row accessibility and the one-touch seat makes that so easy without sacrificing a seat. It even works with a car seat in place. Driving it is a dream; it feels very solid and sturdy. It corners very well and feels more like a car to me than a three row SUV. I love that it sits up a bit higher; this makes visibility better and also makes it handle better in the snow than my Explorer did. I was a loyal Honda and Acura owner for years before buying a Ford, and now that I am back in a Honda I wonder why I ever left. We are very happy with our choice and plan to keep this vehicle for many years!",pos

"This is a great vehicle.  I don't see what the fuss is about the radio not having ""buttons"", just use the steering wheel controls.  I bought a close out 2017 EXL as Edmunds recommended.  I passed on the sensing but went for the AWD.  No need to Nav or RES.  I was able to get 0.9% financing along with $1,500 below invoice using Costco pricing and haggling with 2 different dealers.  I looked at the Highlander and Acadia.  No contest.  Highlander is way to small and the GMC/Chevy don't hold their value.  Traded in our 2013 Toyota Sienna, which I thought was a pretty good vehcile, until I drove the Pilot.  After the test drive, I was hooked and had to have one.  Besides the ride and fit and finish, I really enjoy the apple car play and the how you can customize a lot of the settings in the radio.  That said, I have 2 gripes.  1. no 3rd row floormat AND you can't buy one from Honda unless you buy all the floormats?  So, I bought one from Lloyds mats ($34).  It is just really odd that this isn't included in the EXL.   2. No 12V acc plug in the 2nd row.  My 2005 has one, why not my 2017?   So, I bought a 6ft plug to put in the front and stretch back to the second row.  Again, really odd.  You get one with the RES but not in the base EXL.  Other than that, you will love this car.",pos
Upgraded from the EX-L to the Touring AWD and love it.  Purchased during Black Friday and got a great deal.  Insurance premiums dropped considerably due to all the safety features.  My wife loves the heated seats and remote start features.  I like the roomy interior  for taking my golf buddies and equipment on golf outings.  The newer model has a classier body style compared to the older box style.,pos
"We've had our Pilot for about 2 months and have enjoyed it. Seats are comfortable for long rides and the interior is very spacious. With the 3rd row down we have plenty of space for our 2 dogs. The technology package is nice, although on curvy roads the collision avoidance system warns ""Brake"" when a car is in the curve with you. Steering assist and adaptive cruise control are very handy. AWD is nice, we've driven up a steep snowy driveway and along snow and ice covered roads and its always felt very stable.",pos
roomy and 3rd row fits 2 teenage sons with long legs,pos
Awesome car! I drove all the rest in this class and this is the best!,pos
"Researched Pilot, Explorer and Highlander.  Pilot 3rd row more spacious than Highlander.  Explorer rode more “truck like”.  Had blind spot monitoring on prior - didn’t want to give it up so had to go to Elite model to get it.  Honda should have it in other levels / as option.  Push button gears in Elite - bit different - takes getting used to.  Many well thought out design elements - impressive.  LED headlights are great - very bright - good for those with difficulty seeing at night.",pos
"Absolutely love the car. No issues with the 9 speed transmission as mentioned in some comments/forums, shifts just as smooth as a Lexus. Very nice interior, impresses anyone who sees it. Wish it came with Michelin tires.",pos
perfect car for the whole family,pos
Really pleased. Very spacious. Very comfortable. Really happy with the purchase.,pos
"We purchased the Elite trim to have the best of Honda's safety technology.  Our guests will enjoy the panoramic sun roof, but I don't anticipate the video ever being used. Wish that the engine shut off at stop lights could be disabled. Great, comfortable ride, we look forward to roadtripping, soon!",pos
"On the whole, excellent. We love this car. Only real downsides are that the radio/display is sluggish. Plan on a full second delay before response. The cruise control lane assist is a bit aggressive for my liking. I tend to use the full width of the lane not just the center.",pos
I got the Pilot because i wanted comfortable room to hold mu grand children. Its safe and has a “TV” as my kids say.,pos
"Extremely quiet and comfortable.  I got 32 MPG on a new tank over a 4+ hour drive to New York.  I drove every SUV out there before deciding on the Pilot.  I had a CRV for 11 years and wanted another but, even though the CRV gets all of the rave reviews, I wasn't overly impressed by the drive.  I'm 64 and really wanted quiet comfort.  The step up to the 6 cyl in the Pilot was what I needed.",pos
"Great value when selecting trim levels.  Almost all or nothing.  I can only imagine what you get with Touring and Elite trims.  Wife wanted more bells and whistles from what we had in a 2012 Pilot LX.  EX interior was rough like denim and looked like it would be too hard to remove stains.  EX-L adds luxury with leather, sunroof, power front row seating, and a host of other little overlooked conveniences.  I read complaints on the infotainment limits, but we love it and haven't seen what all the fuss is about.  We have to master the steering wheel buttons to keep our eyes on driving.  The Android Auto app integration is amazing.  I'm sketchy on the privacy tradeoff though.  But beats 1-2k for built in his.  The touchscreen is responsive to our liking.  Went with 2wd because I didn't like the 12' and due to sluggish acceleration and roughness.  The ride quality is great.  Nix the nitrogen option if you can, mixed opinion if it does anything.  Eco mode is noticeable because it throttles ac, acceleration and such.  Very nimble from takeoff without eco mode.  I'd use on highway more.  Shifting is almost unnoticeable with 6 speed transmission.  Still contemplating extended warranty since there is a lot of electronics involved.  Lane assist is useful, again maybe more in a highway scenario.  Looked at Toyota Highlander and 4runner, both couldn't beat the Pilot's 3rd row capacity without pushing 2nd all the way foward.  Didn't see the need for Honda-sensing, I'd like a to retain some decision making while driving.  I've had 5 Hondas before this, and the 2017 exl is a winner in my mind.  Only reason for some 4 stars is I just bought and don't know.",pos
"I have only had my new Pilot for 2 weeks but love it so far. The handling and motor is very good for an SUV. I am still learning all the new gadgets but really like the lane assist feature. Wish there was a CD player, but knew it wasn't there when I purchased it. Sound system is good not great. The only real complaint I have is the arm rest ergonomics for the drivers seat. The adjustment for the right arm of the drivers seat is poor, otherwise the seats are very comfortable for trips. Overall great vehicle and would purchase it again. Plus a shout-out to the team at Rivertown Honda - Great to deal with again",pos
"I love this vehicle!  I have owned 12+/- Hondas, with all of which I have been very pleased. I was going to buy a Cadillac XT5, but then I saw the Pilot Elite. Wow! My past experience with Honda and the fact a comparably equipped XT5 would have cost me $15,000 more than the Elite, made my purchase a no-brainer.  The ride, quietness,and safety features are superb!",pos
This is the best Honda I have had and it is my fifth.  I really enjoy the ride and appearance.,pos
"Traded in 2015 MDX, better value and utility, though drives more like a truck then a sporty MDX. Good for kids and dogs and teenage drivers. Best midsize SUV all around.",pos
"All models should have the blind spot monitoring system, not just a camera in the right side mirror. Everything is great so far. Maintaining 21 mpg around town.  Ride is great. The 9  speed transmission does hunt at lower speeds but I use my cruise control and that stops some of the hunting. A lot of gadgets to distract you, so be disciplined while driving and use the voice command. Well build and very functional vehicle.",pos
Loving my Pilot so far.  It's spacious and comfortable but still easy to maneuver and fit into parking spaces and my garage. Love all the safety and other convenience features as well. Have also been pleasantly surprised by MPG considering I drive a combo of city and highway (with lots of traffic).  I have no complaints yet!,pos
"The 2017 Pilot EX-L is overall an excellent 7-seat SUV. We researched several ones including Pathfinder, Explorer, Highlander, Traverse. One of our main needs was the third row seating. Overall the value of the Pilot is excellent. The performance is excellent, the quality is well known, and it has everything a family may need; from extra USB ports, to three-way climate control, to blind spot monitoring, to many other features that are all standard in the Pilot.",pos
the 2017 Elite is the 4th pilot I've purchased.  I've loved all the others & I think this will follow right in line.,pos
"This is my 2nd Pilot. Had 2005 (bought Dec.'04, 174K mi.) so it was a 'no brainer' to purchase another Pilot.  I've driven several mid-size SUV's; Buick, Nissan Rogue, Jeep, etc., and found myself not considering anything but a Honda; its sleek, stylish from  boxy style of years past.  I'm still reading my owners manual & learning what this mid-priced model is equipped with!",pos
So far I have 1100 miles on it. I am really enjoying the smooth ride. I traded in my 2016 Toyota Highlander for the pilot. I do miss my Highlander but the pilot has so much more options. I don't need the DVD player that you automatically get with this version but it will add value later. The car appleplay is okay. I don't like having to plug in my phone each time to use it. It could be improved. This vehicle has a auto engine idle. The navigation is neat. It shows you exactly where you are as if you are looking from the sky. It even has pictures of exit signs. The sensing is not as sensitive as people have stated. Its doing what is it suppose to do. Lots of interior storage. Leg room is good. The car seems so much bigger from the inside. Overall I am very happy with the purchase,pos
"I was in the market for a mid-sized SUV and shopped online for either a Toyota Highlander or a Honda Pilot.  I had purchased my Honda CR-V EX from Carbone Honda of Bennington, VT the last time I shopped for a vehicle and after a lot of online comparisons from multiple dealerships, I decided to try Carbone Honda in Bennington once again because I knew they were also a Toyota dealership so I could make side-by-side comparisons of the two vehicles.  My salesperson, Rob Albreada was superb in describing the pros and cons of both vehicles.  Because the Pilot's interior was slightly larger than the Highlander (Rob actually measured both interiors with the rear seats folded down), I knew the reliability of Honda products, and the overall look and feel of the vehicle, I decided to purchase the Pilot.  I have had two lengthy trips in the Pilot since buying it and have been extremely happy to have made the choice I did.  The Pilot boasts of 18-26 with an average of 21 mpg but on each trip with the ECO Boost engaged I actually got 28.9 mpg.  The Honda Lane Watch (passenger side camera) when passing vehicles makes it much safer to know it's ok to pull back into the main traffic lane.  The same goes for backing up in reverse with the rear camera.  Overall, this was the right choice for me.",pos
"Very roomy inside, third row seating was the best we found when compared to other SUV's in the same class (except maybe the VW Atlas, that was very good too).   Even the EX trim model came with a lot of nice features.  Gives a super smooth ride!  Opted not to step up to a higher trim and get the sunroof because it was noisy anyway.  We wanted an AWD but found that is hard to get in So Cal because manufacturers do not think divers in So Cal need that, so not many are sent there.\, had to settle for a 2WD.",pos
"I LOVE my new Pilot!  It is comfortable, quiet, and a nice ride.   There is plenty of interior room, and head/leg room, even in the 2nd and 3rd rows.  Good storage between two front seats.  With the 60/40 3rd row split you can put different size cargo in and only give up minimal seating.  The rear 'trunk' space is very limited, so I would suggest installing roof rack bars and investing in a sturdy storage container.  The climate control and entertainment options keep all rows of travelers happy too.  Plenty of cupholders too. One of the issues I have experienced is a seriously over-sensitive front impact safety sense.  It 'screams' BRAKE at you and shakes the steering wheel even when there is no chance for front impact (this is especially true when vehicle is taking a corner to the right and there is a car coming around the same curve on the opposite side).  Can be very unnerving.",pos
Great buy! Nice amenities at a great value. We are extremely happy with the purchase!,pos
"We were shopping for a truck with good reliability, good power ,a lot of rooms and good  safety records. We tested a few trucks but none match the versatility of the pilot. We are very happy with our purchase.",pos
Good value for the money,pos
"The Honda Pilot is a very well built, high quality automobile.  It drives good, rides good, and is very quiet on the road.  It is filled with technology----almost to a fault.  It will take my wife and me some time to learn all of its features.  It is very smooth and is getting very good gas mileage.  I can't imagine that any SUV being made could have more features than does the Pilot.  It is also very roomy.  It also has all wheel drive and stability control, so is very sure footed in rain or snow.
We took a 3,000 trip to the northeast, and the Pilot performed flawlessly.  It is very comfortable and will carry practically anything a traveler would want to take.  The nine speed transmission is very smooth and keeps the engine in an appropriate power/performance range.  The more I drive the car, the more I like and appreciate it.",pos
"I found the Pilot brochure confusing. The included options list implies that the Elite has everything the other models have plus more stuff. Not quite true. It does not tell you what is left out, so it's not completely clear what you are getting. Lane Watch is included in lesser models and I expected it should also be on the Elite. It isn't. Some reviews dislike Lane Watch because it takes your eyes away from the road. The Owner's Guide is inadequate. Photos are too small. Honda should include a full size Owner's Manual. Sure, you can go to their website and download the 679 pages and print it yourself but for a $50,000 Elite, you'd think they would give you one. The Guide shows an option that the Elite should have but doesn't. That is Folding Mirrors. This option would help to protect your mirrors from damage by folding them inwards.  Even though the Guide covers it, I did not see it listed as a feature on any of the models. I have yet to use the shifting paddles. I have not found any information yet on how to use them. I'll keep looking. Though not stylish, the Elite is very comfortable and has a lot of cargo space.",pos
Kelley Blue Book value award.  Elevated technology on board with collision control and warnings,pos
It's a great family car with 3rd row seating. Great value for the long term and for safety. One thing they won't tell you is there's no need for the navigation add on if you have an iPhone it has apple car play. It works through the car's display system when you plug in. So nice. Very happy!,pos
"We test drove the 2017 EX-L 4WD, but ended up buying the 2WD instead.  There was no noticeable difference.  And, given the area we live in, we'd rather save the money.",pos
"I have been a loyal Acura owner for years.  But after drving the MDX,  I liked the features and looks on the Pilot better.  Could not Justify the 9700 difference in price.  If the the price was the same id still by the Pilot.  Only 1000 miles so far, but i love the Pilot.",pos
"Acceleration takes some time getting used to, as it feels different with the 9 speed transmission. Safety features are great, but sensitivity of lane keep assist and auto braking can be overly sensitive. On a hilly road it will sometimes go off when no other cars in sight. Comfort and convenience is superb. I love this vehicle.",pos
"I've owned/driven Hondas for the last 25 years and have always been satisfied with fit, finish, reliability, and safety and I have come to take these things for granted from Honda.  The point is, up to now, I was just satisfied but the 2017 Pilot has blown me away with seemingly all the things I didn't even know I needed.  I've never owned a vehicle with remote start but now I use it almost daily.  I love the auto door unlock/lock feature.  In the past when leaving my vehicle my hands were full and I used to have to fumble for the door lock FOB and juggle packages.  Now I just walk away and the vehicle takes care of itself.  When I return I don't need to unlock the doors I just grab the door handle and the doors unlock.  Don't buy navigation just use Android Auto it integrates well with all of the other Audio options.  I know these are just minor things but the cumulative effect of all the minor design improvements are going to WOW you and make you appreciate your decision to buy this car.  It's fun to drive, looks good, and gets good mileage.  I don't think you will regret it.",pos
Internet online purchase is the best way to buy any 2017 Honda Pilot!,pos
"I bought the Touring model because the Elite model did not have the right side camera, only blind spot indicator in both mirrors.  I would say the blind spot indicator in the left hand side would be handy, but prefer the camera on the right.  There are so many things I love about this Pilot that I can't pick out one favorite.  Engine Idle stop at a light is awesome.  Push button shift is fabulous.  Navigation takes some time to figure out the ins and outs, but it is great.  Love the Adapative Cruise Control and Lane departure warning.  The gas mileage on the open road is wonderful - 30 mpg, around town 23.  Certainly can’t complain.",pos
This car is incredible.  Very roomy and great car for me and my family.,pos
"We looked at the Tahoe, Armada and Highlander and the pilot won us over on its winning combination of performance, economy, advanced AWD system and value. We travel to Vermont often on narrow, private roads that are not always plowed well. Honda's i-VTM is really the Acura SH-AWD with torque vectoring. On dry roads it helps some, but it is also a winner in the deep snow, shifting power left to right as well as front to back as needed. Really great system. The cargo space in this rig is HUGE, especially with part or all of the 3rd row down. The cargo area is equivalent is size to the Tahoe and more usable as the load floor is lower.  The acceleration is decent and I like the intake noise as the VTEC kicks in at higher revs. Without flogging it, I've seen high 20s for MPG on the highway. Overall, over the first 1500 miles, we've gotten 23 MPG combined.  The 9 speed feels a bit weird around 4th or 5th gear but it isn't a big deal. The push button shifter took some getting use to, but after a day we were used to it and it wasn't a big deal. I really liked the looks of the Tahoe, but for the money (and even not considering the money), the Pilot is an unbeatable combo of utility, economy and performance.",pos
A true Honda.,pos
"Sporty, spacious ,good fuel economy is a great family car",pos
"I really like the design of the 2017 Honda pilot.   It's attractive on the outside,  comfortable on the inside.   A few concerns though.  The rear seats could be a little more comfortable but at least they are not used every day.   It also seems like the heat takes a while to really kick in which was not what I was expecting for a brand-new vehicle but perhaps because it's a large space it takes a while.   Also the Bluetooth has not consistently worked.   Overall a five star car though, great in snow and ice and very good gas mileage for this type of vehicle.",pos
Everytime i place a call with either my Iphone 7plus / Iphone 6 Plus / Samsung Galaxy Note 5 / Google Pixel the phone connects to bluetooth and immediately switches to private mode unless you force it manually back to bluetooth. on some of the phones it never even connects. I went to 2 separate dealers and no help. They tried telling me it's a issue with my phone / phones and or my carrier. This issue is on all EX-L and above models. None of these phones have a issue with my 2016 Honda Civic touring or any other car. This issue is known to 2016 Pilots and the new pickup truck which is based on a pilot chasis. I called Honda link and no help other then telling me that i should call once every 6 months to see if there is a update.,pos
Make sure you know what options you want/need.  Dealers tend to equip floor models with everything and many option you don't need.  Trailer hitch is critical for transporting bikes and I recommend the dealer installed option as the fit and finish is much better than other after market installs.,pos
"My Honda pilot saved my life in an extremely bad recent car accident. I was t boned and then head on collision as an other driver ran a red light at the intersection. If it was not for my Honda Pilot's durability and air bags, I don't know if I would be alive or extremely injured. I walked away with a broken arm and sprained ankle and some bruises. I truly believe this car saved my life. Unfortunately my Pilot is totaled, however you couldn't tell by looking at it, but I intend on buying another one. Thank you Honda for making a great car !",pos
"Purchased a 2016 Pilot Touring AWD new.  Very expensive!  But worth it.  We have a number of kids and have thoroughly enjoyed this SUV.  It sits up pretty high, much higher than a minivan (which we have also owned) but drives fairly smoothly and easily.  It has a lot of power but isn't except nimble.  The comfort and minimal road noise are its best qualities.  I have read a number of reviews that complain about the nine speed transmission, but we have found it to work just fine and shift smoothly. The seats are supportive and the interior materials are high quality.  The only drawback is that the space behind the rear sets is small, at least compared to a minivan.  The headlights look great (especially the daytime running LEDs) and the body style is attractive but not overbearing.  I average 25 mph in about 40% city driving and 60% highway driving, which is excellent for this large of a vehicle.  It handles in snow like a dream!  We live on a hill and have had several days where we probably would not have made it home without the pilot AWD.  The rim package on the Touring looks sweet.  Love this car!",pos
Excellent  car. Great gas mileage. City getting at least 20mpg drops when oil needs changing. Price  little steep so shop around for specials or discounts. Could use little more cargo behind 3rd row for luggage  for large family  other wise Love Love my SUV. Easier to park than my F250 Crewcab,pos
"We had traded it in their 2012 Honda CRV for a 2015 Honda Pilot and we're traveling through life just fine for a year. Then one day stopping by the Honda dealership there it was the 2016 pilot. Before I knew it I was in talking to my salesman they gave me a fantastic deal on a trade in three and a half months later are 2016 Honda Pilot touring all wheel drive arrived. This vehicle is so much more than the 2015 pilot was. Smooth, quiet, very powerful, and all the options that one could will it. I must say the button shifting was something to get used to but now I'm very accustomed to it and wouldn't go back to a regular manual shifter. I can't say enough about the way the pilot Drives, handles, and once in awhile I must say I am guilty of disappointing kids and their little rocket cars as I ease into the gas pedal and deposit them in my rearview mirror. Handling is great visibility is good and I'm very happy with the vehicle. As we passed 38,200 miles the Pilot has taken us to Orlando and back as well as Mackinac Bridge, Chicago, Ohio, Detroit, and various points of interest, to include daily activities. All completed without a hitch. 30k service was a sticker shock with this fancy German ZF9 tranny accounting for $400.00 of the service bill. The Pilot is still wonderful to drive. Honda sent us a warranty extension on the ZF9 tranny extending it to ten years unlimited miles. We got a second letter requesting we bring the Pilot in for so the can replace the transmission fluid heater which has been failing causing motor and transmission failure. Yikes!!! I hope Honda's new ten speed and the standard ZF9 in all the new Odyssey vans have this shorted out. Love my Pilot, but I ordered a Ridgeline RTL-E in Obsidian blue three months ago. Rides even better than the Pilot, has the good old reliable six speed that only cost $100 to service as well as 18"" tires that are going 50k or more rather than my 20"" that were replaced at 31k! Just wish the Ridgeline made for the USA had all the Canadian Touring options. Despite the tranny the Pilot Touring AWD is far and away still my choice over the new Traverse and the much smaller Highlander. Our road trip to Florida was outstanding! Thanks Pilot!!! The Ridgeline will be a worthy replacement for our family of four.",pos
"**Update as of 3-29-18.  We've now had our Pilot for more than a year and have put about 24,000 miles on it.  We still love this car, and I wouldn't change anything about the review I wrote in early 2017, below.  The transmission hasn't given us a single problem and is still the smoothest shift I've ever experienced in a car.  We've also driven the Pilot in the snow and it performs wonderfully.  We've packed it to the max inside and had car top carriers on it for long trips, have taken it camping, and have used it to shuttle kids around.  Great, reliable SUV that hasn't had a single mechanical glitch or problem.  The bluetooth connectivity is still a little frustrating, but i think we're used to how it works.  It's not very intuitive, and so I'm hoping Honda will have a software update in the future.  For example, figuring out how to switch from one phone to another is nearly impossible.   But that's the only complaint that i still have.  

My wife and I read a lot of reviews prior to purchasing our 2016 Honda Pilot at the end of December, 2016.  There were so many reviews/complaints about the 9-speed transmission that comes standard in the Touring and Elite models, that we were completely scared off of those trim levels, at least initially.  We test drove a Pilot EX model, which has the old 6-speed transmission that we'd had in our older Pilot.  We didn't even want to test drive the Touring model because of the 9-speed transmission.  But then we did.  And we loved it.  And after three months and trips through the mountains, on flat terrain, in city traffic, sitting on highways in traffic, and etc... there is absolutely not a single complaint that we have about the 9-speed transmission.  In fact, i can say with all honesty that it is the smoothest transmission I've ever experienced.  Up-shifting and downshifting is smooth and nearly imperceptible, no matter what the terrain.  The tranny is very smooth and responsive as well.   My brother in law, who knows cars well, drove our car (and knew nothing about the transmission complaints in the reviews), and the first comment he made was that the transmission was incredibly smooth and quiet.  That was totally unprompted (I didn't ask him, ""so what did you think of the transmission"" or anything to that effect).  The Pilot has loads of room for our family of five and the dog, on long trips, and has plenty of power for the mountains.  The Touring model has a number of bells & whistles that we like that just don't come on the EX (including that very quiet, smooth transmission).  One thing that we appreciate the most is the extra sound proofing material in the Touring that doesn't come on the EX model.  It's makes our Pilot noticeable quieter than the cheaper model.  Test drive both in succession and I'm sure you'll agree.  The Honda Sensing takes some getting used to, but it's really handy, especially on long trips.  The braking on the adaptive cruise control can jolt if a car cuts in front of you, but i don't understand why people would complain about that.  Of course the brakes will apply if someone cuts in front of you!   In any event, three months and counting and we love our pilot and haven't had a single issue with it, except for some Bluetooth connectivity weirdness.  When my wife's and my phones are in the car at the same time, we sometimes having trouble connecting to the phone of our choice.  Who know's whether that's more user error than technical glitch.   As for the absence of a radio volume knob - that' s no big deal.  We love having what is in effect an iPod in the dash rather than some old analog knobs.  Great SUV.  We highly recommend.",pos
It feels much wider than our previous SUV (probably is) and my wife is a little skittish driving and parking it.  I think it will just take time to adjust.,pos
I am seeing a lot of negative comments but if you are expecting a Mercedes GLE for under $35000 then you are dreaming. I bought Pilot LX 2016 for my wife while we own a 2011 Toyota RAV4. And after driving Pilot I sold my RAV4 to buy another Pilot LX. Reasons are : 1)Same 22.5mpg on both even though Pilot is much bigger. 2) Pilot was much smoother and quite (in RAV4 we could not have a conversation in the highway especially with people on 2nd row). 3)Much more powerful and better pickup (my RAV4 was 4 cylinder; can't comment on RAV4 2011 6 cylinder). 4) When we make trips with friends we haul them in our 2 SUVs (3rd row is good enough for 2 people under 6ft or 3 kids; contrary to other SUVs with 3rd row where your head hits the top on each bump. There is no better SUV of same size and at same price in the market today!,pos
I was told to be wary of this new Pilot but it is EVERYTHING it was supposed to be.  Nine speed is awesome and ride across country  was a dream.   All of the safety features are a big plus and ACC worked great..      Great job Honda,pos
"Purchase for wife who drove 2012 MDX.  This is better and less $.   Wife loves the how the middle seat slides forward to let  the grandkids into the 3rd seat.  Bought used with 4K miles for $34K.  Fastest car I've ever owned.  Electronics are quirky.  Radio display drops channels and then they reappear later on the screen.  Overall quality seems great.  Great ride and easy to drive.  Love the 2016 styling.   Would recommend.

1/26/18 - this car has about 35K miles and is perfect.  The ride is so much better than the MDX.  More like a car and very smooth.  No new issues.",pos
"Absolutely love this pilot.  Very comfortable, excellent safety features, stylish.  I went from an Audi to my Honda Pilot and just LOVE it.  It's the 2016 model so not boxy and large like it used to be (which I liked as well).  I still get it confused with the Mercedes SUV's that are in the parking lot as well as the BMW SUV's.  I am surprised on the gas mileage we are getting with our Pilot - averaging 25-28 mph - which is more than we were getting with our Audi A4.  This Pilot is everyone in our family's favorite!",pos
Honda has it wrong with the way they market... lots of options on EXL but most cars on the lot only come with one.,pos
"Great car, for a good price. The back up camera and Bluetooth are awesome. I'm not a fan of the touch screen. It's hard to use and very confusing. But, overall I love Honda's. I'm very disappointed that there's not a CD player.",pos
It's roomy and comfortable. Love the new exterior,pos
"This is an update review for our 2016 Honda Pilot EX that we bought in November 2015. We still love it! We have had no problems with this Pilot. Something we didn't mention in the prior review is that the grand kids love sitting in the 3rd row seats. We sometimes have had their friends along too - all of the kids want to ride in the 3rd row seats. A couple of the kids' friends (under age 12) have told us how much they like this vehicle. Adult friends of ours sat in the driver's seat to determine visibility. They liked it alot. They will be shopping for a Honda Pilot rather than the Toyota Highlander that they had previously owned, since they said the new Highlander does not have good visibility . All in all, the 2016 Pilot EX has been great.
======================================================
Prior review:
We bought our 2016 Honda Pilot EX with Honda Sensing in November of 2015, so we have had it for a year now. So far so good - no problems whatsoever. We owned a 2004 Honda Pilot prior to the 2016, and had no problems with that vehicle either. We feel that the 2016 is quieter and more comfortable than the 2004. We make good use of the versatility of the 2nd & 3rd row seats: most of the time we keep the 3rd row seat folded down to allow hauling of luggage and other stuff to our vacation cottage, or for those stock-up trips to the local warehouse store. Often we fold the second row seats down too for added hauling space. We have also had 7 adults in this vehicle on several occasions with all the seats in the upright positions. That worked out just fine too. Everyone who has ridden in this Pilot loves it. They remark about how quiet and comfortable the ride is. The Honda Sensing allowed for an additional discount on the vehicle insurance too. We appreciate the lane keeper warning, and the comfort in knowing that there is collision avoidance for the front, although that has not ever deployed. We are very happy with this Pilot.",pos
"It's a Honda. Solid. Well designed. And despite it being the first automatic transmission I have ever owned, I actually enjoy driving it. It sure does make life with kids easier. I feel quite spoiled without having to spend so much on a luxury vehicle.",pos
"We traded in the 2010 Pilot at about 50K miles. The shocks were in need of replacing and it was time for brake work.  We had averaged 15-16 MPG. This Pilot in mixed driving is giving me 20 mpg. We also dumped a 2010 Toy High Hybrid which when my wife drove it in town was 17 mpg. With the Pilot we love all of the thoughtful places to put bottles, cups, brushes, and other ""necessities"". The ride beats the 2010. I bought this on 12/30/15 seeking to get that end of the year deal and I guess I did OK. I wanted one with all of the assist packages, but they claimed none were in town at the time. We purchased a 2016 Volvo XC60 for my wife, but for travel we both prefer the comfort of the Pilot. I've had no problems so far and had none with the 2010. I am extremely fond of this vehicle. I'm 6'4"" and have lots of room.",pos
"It is everything we were looking for in a 8-seater SUV. Drives great, very roomy and plush interiors.",pos
"I have had the Pilot Elite for almost one year now and have over 16,000 miles on the clock. Mostly city driving but have made trips from Cincinnati to Chicago, South Carolina, Tennessee, cross country to Glacier national Park and Washington State and recently to Georgia. The car performs well, I am getting over 26 mpg on highway driving, the adaptive cruise control is magic. Rear entertainment system kept my daughter entertained for 3 weeks over the summer. Dealership is GREAT and, when I had a strange noise coming from my wheel in Keystone, SD I had a fantastic dealer experience in Rapid City where they fit me in and removed a stone from brakes! The car is comfortable to drive, really LOVE the cooled front seats in the hot humid summer, great visibility and good looking too! I could moan about the GPS or Pandora interface but expect that Honda is just as impatient with these issues as we are. I would definitely recommend this family vehicle. Loads of space, too, for visits to Home Depot!!",pos
I have tried Highlander 2012 for four years and owning this car for 3 months and see that Honda Pilot is above everything than Toyota Highlander. It's definetely best SUV.,pos
Own this car for less than a month and it drives like a dream.  This is my 4th new Honda and I know I can expect this standard of performance for many years to come,pos
"I bought my 2016 Pilot EX-L AWD on 9/2016. I have already taken it on a small road trip and every time I drive it, I fall in love again. It's been great in the short time I've had it and hoping it will last a lifetime. Sometimes the Bluetooth goes out but I just reset it. Technology, go figure. But the drive, the comfort and the space is really wonderful! I traded my Murano for it and while I thought I would have that car forever I am really happy I traded it in for the Pilot. I do wish the panoramic roof was available on the lower trims but still happy with at least having a sun roof. Great SUV!",pos
"Great car, fun to drive,gets really good gas mileage.",pos
"Great suv ,my first suv",pos
"This is an amazing vehicle!  It features a smooth, quiet ride with exceptional visibility. We've owned it since April - 14,000mi so far - two major road trips.  It handles beautifully with gas mileage 24.7 overall.  The 9-speed transmission is smooth and shifts flawlessly.  We purchased the Elite to get all the electronic safety features we could - they all work beautifully. The vehicle is close to being able to drive itself!  The fabulous GPS has guided us through 11 states without mistakes!  The entertainment system performs well in all functionality including movies.  After owning 4 vehicles from Lexus I can honestly say that this SUV is one of the great ones - nice job HONDA!!!",pos
"This is our third Pilot.  One of each body style.  This is by far the most comfortable with more driver and passenger leg room.  The rear passenger space is much more comfortable also.  The rear cargo space isn't quite as wide or as tall as my 2009 Pilot but it seems adequate.  My wife misses the lower shelf storage area the 09 Pilot had but overall she is very happy.  The one feature I dislike the most is the Auto idle Stop feature.  I wish they had it default to off instead of on. Every time I start the car I have to disable it because I don't like the slight hesitation there is when you start from a stop sign or signal.  Maddening quite frankly.
One problem we have with the car is the plastic face of the navigation screen.  It scratched easily.  We have always used the supplied microfiber cloth to wipe away fingerprints.  Recently we used it and it scratched the face of the unit.  The face isn't replaceable and you would have to buy a entire new unit at great expense.  Honda should have used a glass face or have a replacement screen available.  I have since used several scratch removers that have partially removed the scratches.  I then purchased a screen protector that cuts some of the glare and hence the scratches aren't as visible.",pos
"7 adults can be seated comfortably, superior handling on freeways and village roads too, city 20/21 mpg, highway 26.1 mpg. Best inclass outward visibility, lots of storage space and cup holders, only downside Honda should offer navigation on the available 8"" touch screen.",pos
My 1st Honda andealership SUV and it's wonderful! Heard and read great reviews about the Pilot. After owning a month I must say I'm completely satisfied at this point. I'll keep updating my post to let you guys know how my Pilot treats me on this journey!,pos
"Compare other vehicles, look for great internet deals( i got mine at ~$2k less than sticker price)",pos
"Very happy with my Pilot.  My last SUV was a Saturn Outlook, which I was able to get 200,000 miles on. Pilot, in my opinion, looks great. The ride is outstanding and quiet. I upgraded on the stereo, was a little disappointed that it doesn't really rock when I crank it. I did a lot of research and test drives.  If you are a bigger guy (6-2 +) this is a great ride.  It feels larger in the hip and shoulder area.  Also, it has more headroom.  The legroom was a little less than my Outlook.  I like to stretch my legs out to ride.  I know I am rambling.  Just wanted to say that I am very happy with my purchase and would encourage you to test drive.",pos
"Okay, I get it.  Some here hate the 9 speed transmission, and I almost settled for the EX-L as a result of those reviews, but I am happy to report that I ignored those folks, did my own investigation and I am glad I did.  The 9 speed is different, and it takes some getting used to, but it is very, very smooth.  The sport mode is fantastic for movement down steep mountain grades and combines nicely with the new suspension that allows for sharp cornering without feeling top heavy.  It actually corners better than many of the cars I have owned.  On the highway, the 9 speed transmission is as smooth as butter and really delivers an awesome ride.  In town, the 9 speed transmission performs well too.  When I drove the car home from the dealer, I did notice a difference during the stopping, slowing down process.  What I concluded is that the sound of the transmission differs from the normal 6 speed in that it does an audible ""rev"" that in my opinion fools the driver into thinking the car is speeding up.  After a few days of really paying attention, I tried to manufacture a ""rev"" or lurch but just couldn't.  I am not saying the issue is in everyone's head, but what I am saying is that the transmission behaves differently and that the behavior takes some getting used to--just like anything new.  It may also require some adjustment of driving habits too.  I am still feeling it out, and by no means want imply that others' impressions are incorrect.  But I will say, had I relied entirely on some of the negative views here, I would have gotten an EX L, and I would have missed out on the Touring, which in my opinion is a hands down winner.  Not to mention the value gained by stepping up one model!  Just my thoughts.",pos
"First new car, first time Honda buyer. VERY happy. Absolutely love the space in the car. The technology is amazing. Do not have the DVD package, wanted kids to actually interact with me in the car :) LOVE the Honda Road Readers - can download books onto my iPhone and then using the bluetooth, we can all listen to stories. My favorite!",pos
"I traded in my 2010 Toyota Sienna last October. The first thing the 2016 Pilot impressed me is its fuel economy. It is much better than my Toyota van. In the Minnesota winter, I could get average of 20 mpg for mixed local and freeway drivings. The new Pilot is also very quiet, much lower road noise compared to the minivan I had. The ride is so smooth and stable. On a smooth road, you just can't feel the speed you are driving. With the AWD, it handles so well on snow. The car doesn't look big from outside, but sitting inside you feel it's quite roomy. I had 8 adult rides several times and never heard anyone complained. Before I bought the Pilot, I read much about the problems with the same 9-speed transmission on Jeep. But I never had any issue with my transmission. It always shifts smoothly up and down, and reacts swiftly. I guess Honda must have a better software control. The lane keeping technology works very well even with poor road marks, at night, and in rain conditions. I really enjoy driving the 2016 Pilot.",pos
"I have had Tahoes (3) Escalades Blazers and traded a 2009 pilot in for the 2016.  I cannot believe how much a leap forward the new pilot is. It checks all of my boxes, main thing is the ability to carry up to 8 in comfort (including the rear seats). The ride and road manners are great seems much more spacious than the 2009 and the fuel economy is aces. We average around 30 MPG on the road per the trip computer.  A++++++++",pos
"This car is a great compromise for the big family that doesn't want to go ""minivan"". My 7&10 yo kids love the 3rd row & can get in/out without assistance. 3rd row access for adults is not terrible for the smaller physically fit, but more challenging for the larger or not so athletic (like getting into the back of a 2 door coupe). But once you're there leg room & comfort aren't bad for a 3rd row. If wanting to seat adults in 3rd row, I still suggest minivan with 2nd row captains chairs. Also, since the 2nd row does not offer captains chairs or removable center seat (unless you go Elite trim $$$) it's a bench with a 60:40 split. So if you put 1 car seat in 2nd row, you can access the 3rd on the opposite side. If you put 2 car seats in 2nd row, you can't even get to the 3rd row because you can't fold the seat forward with a car seat on it. So just keep that in mind if you have lots of littles. My 2 are just using the 3rd row, leaving the 2nd for guests. & they have folded the 2nd flat & use it for a foot rest or game surface (cards, battleship) for trips. My kids are happy to have AC vents & controls in the 2nd row, but have been complaining of low air flow in 3rd row vents. I have to crank it on extreme High to get any air into those way back vents. But it has been 100F this month so may just be a summer thing. Overall we absolutely love our Pilot EX. And our insurance rate went down with all the safety specs, despite the hefty purchase price! A very welcome surprise 👍🏻",pos
This is the third Honda Pilot that I have owned and it is definitely the best.  It is very smooth riding and handling.  The interior and exterior finish is superb especially the liberal use of leather on the interior.  The complaints that I read about prior to purchase regarding the navigation system are unfounded.  I found the entertainment and navigation very easy to operate unless you object to frequent cleaning of the touch screen.  Conclusion:  Congratulations to Honda.  This is the best Pilot that they have offered.,pos
This is my 2nd Pilot. I went from the  2010 EX-L to the 2016 Elite and I love the navigation and all of the bells and whistles which are standard in the Elite. I can't speak of the reliability yet since I only own it for 2 weeks.,pos
"After shopping around, unlike what you used to do with a sales person, there was NO negotiating the price of buying this vehicle anywhere. However, technology certainly played a role in the purchase of this vehicle and Edmunds.com was a huge help in locating the best deal in Southern California. We love our SUV! Thank you!",pos
Loving my new Pilot.  I was worried that moving from a mini-van to an SUV may make me sacrifice space.  But the Pilot is very roomy.  And definitely more stylish!,pos
"We have owned 5 different Hondas in the last 11 years, passing down the older models to our growing children. This Honda Pilot touring AWD is by far the nicest of them. I researched this vehicle for two months before it even came out and has definately been worth the wait. This will be a vehicle that we will keep until it dies! It has everything you would need and more. I still haven't said, "" I just wish it had_____."" I don't think I will. I have the power I love with all of the conveniences, and most importantly, the space I need, wrapped up in a stylish new package.",pos
The whole family really likes the Honda Pilot.  I had to replace another 2016 pilot after I was hit by an inattentive driver and rolled my car two times.  I was able to walk away from it. So I'm a believer in the safety of the car. Bought another right after the check came.,pos
"We have had our Pilot for a little over a month.  We've taken it to Lake Tahoe, and around town of course.  It climbed the mountains and handled the corners with ease on the way to Tahoe.  I'm anxious for winter to come so I can test the AWD system as I head to the ski resorts.  The vehicle is incredibly comfortable (I suppose that's subjective based on each person's comfort level), and the interior is very nicely laid out.  I actually look forward to road trips since we have more room to spread out.  We will probably have the 3rd row folded down 99% of the time.  With that, there is a lot of cargo space in the back.  There is even a fair amount of room with the 3rd row up.  My wife and I have two young boys, and they it is nice that their car seats are far enough away so that they cannot reach each other.  No more fists flying back and forth between the two of them as was the case in our '06 CRV, which we kept since it is a great vehicle in its own right.  The touchscreen radio takes a little getting used to, but it is easy to navigate once you get the hang of it.  We were considering purchasing a Tahoe or Explorer, but are very happy we went with the Pilot. We are looking forward to having the Pilot as our family car for many years to come.",pos
The control pad is like a mini iPad. Fuel efficiency is 28 mpg as stated. Comfort. Technology.,pos
I had a '15 Pilot and just purchased a '16 AWD Pilot and it is like night and day!  The drive is a totally different feel! I absolutely love my car! The only complaint is with the touch screen. I wish they had something to go over the screen so you don't see all the finger prints. And sometimes when I first crank the preset radio stations do not show. But I just power off the radio and restart it. Love love my new Pilot!!,pos
"I just bought this Pilot 6/15 and to this Pilot has surpassed my expectations. The ride is both very smooth with very little outside noise. The best part is that my grandchildren love it as it is so roomy, each gets their little section..I have now had my Pilot for 6 months and still am extremely happy with it. I have taken a couple of trips and the Pilot handles great on the highway. It has plenty of power and really good response. The seats are extremely comfortable on long rides and there is very little roadnoise which makes ride even better. The controls are all easily accessible and are quite easy to use. The safety features are excellent like lane departure warnings,the rear camera and automatically slowing you down if you are following too close to other cars. I am completely happy with the entertainment system and sound system is excellent. I would highly recommend this vehicle.",pos
Best car ever.,pos
We are currently leasing a Pilot.  This SUV is a great vehicle.  The interior space is so big and the ride is so comfortable.  Great for family trips as this seats 8 comfortably. A little pricey but worth every single cent. Really glad we went with Honda as our make.,pos
"If you want the Elite Trim you will have to be patient and lucky.  Some sales associates that need to make their numbers will push the lower trims.  They may tell you there is not much difference in what you get.  Do your home work and sit in one yourself.  The Elite closes the gap with Acura MDX, Buick Enclave, Jeep Grand Cherokee, and Lexus RX etc.  You may read reviews that complain about the controls for the radio and navigation.  There are some valid annoyances and you can get over them.  (Volume can go crazy when switching between sources, i.e. Bluetooth to phone, Bluetooth to FM, iPod to radio.)  So turn down your volume a little prior to switching sources.",pos
"Its been 2 weeks that i bought my new Honda Pilot 2016, overall i am satisfied, thought of buying Acura MDX, settled with Pilot as it is giving all i needed. I really feel its more than worth what i paid, enjoying 6 cylinders performance.",pos
"It is everything I expected and more, I think it should have a satellite system",pos
"Great car,great value.",pos
We still love our new Pilot!,pos
"We considered the Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander and Subaru Outback, the later being considered largely because of it's mileage.  I think we would have been happy with any of the three but we LOVE the Pilot.  I read all the reviews on here and elsewhere panning the touch screen entertainment system and complaining about the 9 speed transmission and while I think I understand the reasons I don't agree.  We have found the touchscreen to be responsive and easy to use, after you get used to it.  It's not extremely intuitive but unless you're just renting the car for a day or two, read the manual.  Once you become familiar with it, it's responsive and easy to use.  It does have a glossy screen and fingerprints can readily be seen which is a little annoying to my wife.  

I would say we chose the Pilot over the Highlander for 3 reasons; the AWD system is superior, there's more space in the 3rd row seats and it gets better gas mileage.   Mileage was part of the reason we only considered the 9 speed but I really stressed over going with that transmission given all the negative comments.  I will say this, it does hunt for gears but it seems that should be expected, I mean it has 9 speeds, all of which are probably passed through before you get to 60 mph.  I don't mean its particularly noticeable accelerating to highway speed, quite the contrary, it's smooth as silk accelerating.  When it's somewhat noticeable is when it is shifting down at lower speeds, more so going down hill.  I don't consider it to be a big issue and I'm satisfied with our choice of the 9 speed.  As for my hoped for mileage advantage, so far we are satisfied there.  We recently went through the better part of a tank of gas on two trips, mostly highway miles.  Over 369.3 miles we averaged 27.02 mpg and no, I'm not relying on the trip computer, said computer claimed 25.5 mpg.  Honestly I expected something more like 24 mpg.  As for the two trips measured; the first was 120 miles from an altitude of 3,500 ft to around 1,200 ft (trip computer listed 29.5 mpg for that leg) and the second was a round trip for the remainder of the miles.  While our average speed for most of the trips was in the 70-75 mph range a good 10 miles was in stop and go traffic (one hour).  We kept the vehicle in ECON mode for most of these miles and I do think that makes a significant difference.  I don't expect this kind of mileage on all our trips but I do think the 26 mpg hwy rating is fair.  I'll let you know what I find in city and combined driving sometime later.

Things I'm not crazy about are the Collision Mitigation system which as others have said is a little touchy, especially if you are a somewhat aggressive driver.   For my wife it's probably perfect but for me it's too sensitive, especially if I'm in heavy traffic.  On the other hand it does have an on/off switch.  Same with the lane keep assist system which at times misreads heavy tar lines as road paint (not frequently but sometimes).  Also, if you forget you have the system on and go to switch lanes without signaling the system will fight you a little.....as I said, it has an on/off switch too.  Overall I like both systems but they can be improved.  Finally, the auto-engine-stop system works fine but if you're somewhat aggressive pulling into traffic from a stop you need turn it off or be aware it's on because there is a slight lag if you're quick off the brake to the gas.  This system had an on/off switch but unlike the other systems mentioned it must be turned off each time you start the car.   Again, this will never be a problem for a cautious driver and it's not very intrusive when it's working but for me, I have to be very aware.  

All in all, this is a VERY fine piece of machinery that has really impressed us.   So far, my wife and I are extremely happy with our choice.  We love the car and would recommend it to anyone considering a suv/cross-over AWD.",pos
Everything good,pos
"Remarkably quiet and smooth riding. Great  acceleration. Auto locking means that I do not have to remember to lock the Honda when I exit! USB ports allow unlimited recording on flash drives, (I have stored over 100 CD albums in my flash drives) Cup holders everywhere store air fresheners, sun block, tissues, etc. I love it, but enter and exit the garage slowly with only 1 1/4 inches of clearance on each side. Is this SUV too wide for your garage at 79.6""? Video behind the car while in reverse really helps and is bright and clear at night. Right side video with hash marks helps me see when it is safe to pull in front of a vehicle in the lane to the right. It is hard to get into the 3rd row seats unless you buy running boards; however, I do not use the third row seats. I have a painter's drop cloth behind the second row of seats and carry my dogs back there.",pos
"I took my time purchasing the new Pilot because of the questionable reviews early on, particularly around the transmission, entertainment system technology, and fit/finish. We have been very pleased with the vehicle overall. I took the car for a lengthy test drive to ensure that I was comfortable with the transmission. While it has a slight lag from a full stop while in Economy mode, I don't feel that is excessive, perhaps because I've owned other fuel efficient vehicles that don't provide immediate acceleration. It does accelerate just fine once it does take off. And I have not experienced any of the gear-searching that early reviewers mentioned.

The active safety technology is pretty incredible, particularly for longer highway trips. Auto high-beam headlights, auto wipers, blind spot information system, and adaptive cruise control/lane-keep assist system all make the driving experience almost effortless. Problems with fit and finish from early on appear to have been addressed, as our vehicle has no such issues.

The only thing that does feel somewhat unrefined is the Auto Engine Off idle stop functionality, which can be turned off, albeit impermanently. If it is particularly hot or cold, you will likely want to turn off the Econ mode to maximize heating or cooling from the HVAC system.  And I still prefer Google Maps on my phone to the Nav system. 

All in all, we are very happy with our purchase.",pos
"It took me several weeks of dealing with car dealerships until I found exactly what I wanted (color, trim). I've owned it for about a month and I'm very impressed with the highway and city mpg. We drove on our first long trip and we were averaging 28mpg.",pos
"I traded my 2015 RX350 for the 2016 Pilot EXL. The RX was loaded with every option available and the Pilot is stock but I would never trade back! The ride is far superior and the handling is perfect for me, it steers like an arrow. There is less road noise and vibration than the RX had and the seats are far more comfortable. The interior is spacious and attractive with plenty of cargo room. If I have to complain about anything it's that the driver seat seems a little lacking in range of motion compared to the RX. in my opinion there should be just a little more forward tilt to the seat. I have to set the seat in a lower position than I like to compensate for the lack of tilt because if I sit higher the front edge of the seat presses hard into the back of my leg causing it to feel numb. I'm getting used to sitting lower. I like the back up camera that comes as a standard option, again it's better than the RX and the signal light rear view camera is also a great option, it makes changing lanes safer than just a shoulder check. I would recommend this vehicle to anyone.
I think the speakers could be better, I have the EXL model and am planning to have the speakers replaced with a higher quality.

Almost two years later and I like it even more than I did when I bought it and have had no problems whatsoever with the pilot. Recently took it on a road trip and the gas mileage I got was great! The seat was a bit stiff at first but after a few months has become much more comfortable, I don't even think about it anymore. Love it!",pos
"Bought the SUV one month ago.  So far we love it.  Too soon to tell about reliability, but we're optimistic.",pos
"The Pilot Elite has an extremely smooth ride with lots of cool conveniences.  Love the sound system, heated/air conditioned seats & the heated steering wheel!  You won't be disappointed!!",pos
"Only had this vehicle seven months, hopefully I will feel the same in future months!!!!",pos
"My car is amazing! I LOVE it SO much...it's like my best friend! If you view consumer reports, do NOT listen to anything they say about the new 9 speed auto-it shifts so smoothly and the buttons are anything but unintuitive. 5 Stars for sure.",pos
"I previously owed a 2011 touring model.  Had no problems.  I now own a 2016 Elite. Gas mileage, acceleration, exterior, interior and overall performance is much better than my previous Pilot.  The navigation system is a little hard to operate but that may be because I was so familiar with the older version.  I do not care for the navigation lock out .  It may be a safety feature but it disallows my passenger from making changes to the map and destination while vehicle is in motion.   The safety systems, and there are many, seem to work well.  I'm a little Leary of the forward collision system so I elect to shut it down.  I feel it sometimes over reacts  and then is sluggish to retire.  There is also a by pass for the engine idle shut off but it has to be activated every time the car is restarted.  Wish there was a way to disable this function on a more permanent basis.  Front seats do not seem as comfortable as on my 2011 Pilot.  That may be due to the seats being ventilated as well as heated.  The drivers seat arm rest and front passenger arm rest leave much to be desired in my opinion.  They are adjustable up and down but seem very small and rather cheap.  Other than those few complaints, I'm very happy with the vehicle so far.  May be to soon to give a thumbs up approval because I have only owned this vehicle since January of this year. Update. May 2017 after driving this vehicle for approximately 17 months I can honestly say this is the best automobile purchase I have ever made. Approaching 20,000 miles and it's tight as the first day off the lot. Normally drive at 75 mph on the interstate but yesterday we had an open stretch of road so I decided to see how it preformed at higher speed. At 113 mph it was still very quiet, handled well and still had much power left over. MPG overall is approx 24.4 and 27.6 on the interstate at 75+ MPH. Just an overall great vehicle. Dec. 2017 and 24000 miles. Still love this Pilot. Will probably purchase another one in 2020.",pos
"I recently bought my fourth Grand Cherokee (2018 Summit) since 2014, and I still own the third (2017 Trailhawk). I have had to deal with a few recall issues, but have not had any reliability issues. I will admit the first two had less than 40,000 miles each when traded-in. I was one who swore they would never own a Chrysler product (mostly because of the reputation of being unreliable), but loved the look of the 2014 Grand Cherokee so decided to test drive one. I was most impressed with the comfortable, quiet ride and great driving dynamics. Im sure there are people who have had serious problems with their Grand Cherokees, but I think anyone who categorically rules out owning a Grand Cherokee because of a perceived lack of reliability is doing themselves a great disservice. The late model (WK2) Grand Cherokee is a fantastic vehicle with great comfort and good fuel economy. I am more impressed every time I drive one after driving something else.",pos
"This is my fourth SUV I have owned and by far the best. Quality great, Power (295 HP V6), Ride, handlels great and Quitness is unbeliveable, just the right size I am a big man and I am very comfortable while driving. I do not need the third row seat so I foleded it down and it gave me plenty of room for my large dog. One other thing Great Gas Mileage.",pos
"It handles very well and has a smooth ride. I also like the safety features like brake warning, blind spot warning, to name a couple. With this turbo engine, some people have had a problem with excessive fuel getting into the oil. I have not. I am keeping a watch on it, but for now its not an issue for me. Having been a long time Honda owner, I feel a fix will be coming for those with the issue. The only very minor complaint I have is the black carpet. Every little bit of dirt shows. I would prefer the gray, but no longer available. Highly recommend.",pos
"What could I say this car excels in every way, this is my 4th CRV and our 1oth Honda since 1982, never had a problem",pos
"I love the way my Jeep drives! Its the perfect size for my family, dogs included. Great fuel mileage and really good ride!",pos
I have owned several Hondas and this is one of the best! The 1.5l turbo worried me so I bought from a dealer that included a lifetime warranty on powertrain including the turbo. The engine is plenty powerful and I am averaging 34 mpg and its AWD. I commute 60 miles a day to work so time will tell how good and reliable the engine / car is. If its like my Hondas of past it will be great for many years to come!,pos
"Waited a year before reviewing, as I was in love with it on day 1 and wanted to be sure I felt the same after a year. Traded in a 2014 and wow what a difference 3 years made in comfort, tech and safety! My 2005 CRV was a great vehicle and I have stuck with Honda CRVs ever since. I have never been disappointed with any of them. This one is my fav with the EXL version it had everything I wanted and then some. MUCH quieter ride, turbo engine is flawless, quiet and fast. Love the new design and upgrades Honda finally made with the CRV. The auto high beams are awesome! Would purchase again for sure!",pos
"I absolutely love my Grand Cherokee!! I purchased my Gray 2017 Grand Cherokee Limited 5.7L in September of 2016, and have put nearly 50k miles on it. My husband and I do a lot of outdoor activities such as running, mountain biking, snowboarding, kayaking, paddle boarding, and sailing. Having a Jeep had always been a dream of mine and my Grand Cherokee lives even further beyond my expectations. The exterior is absolutely gorgeous and the LED Headlights are pretty amazing especially in some tough winter conditions here in the Northeast. I have a THULE Roof Rack System installed and Jeep made it extremely easy with their roof rails to install the system. In addition to that, I tow my boat which is around 4500Ibs and the Jeep can tow it with no issues whatsoever. The interior is really where the Limited shines however. I would go as far as to say that this is a luxury SUV. The leather seating is absolutely amazing with the heating and memory functions. Overall, I love my Jeep and will have many more in my future!!",pos
This is my third jeep purchased.I am a die hard Jeep enthusiast! The 2017 Grand Cherokee Limited 6 cylinder is by far the bigger bang for my buck. Spent 3 hours in awe at Marinos Jeep store on the north-side. Trading in my 2014 was a great move. Keep up the good work! Special thanks to Allen and the whole team at Marino:),pos
"I have owned this car for 9 months. Obviously, I wont know if this was truly a terrific buy for another 10 years, but as of right now I feel that it is a great car. The handling is great, vision superb and overall great comfort. Terrific in the snow, I easily went through over 18 inches of snow this winter, slicing through it like butter. Additionally, the mileage is really good for its size and AWD dynamics. Without heat, you can get upwards of 35+ mpg on the highway. Overall, I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a safe financial investment, as this car holds its value extremely well.",pos
"Smooth ride on Michelin tires and gets 24 mpg in town and 32 mpg on hwy with the 2.7 liter 185 horsepower engine. If drivers dont tromp the gas pedal they can achieve better mpg and save wear and tear on their vehicles. The 2.7 engines will go 250,000 miles so it is a good choice.",pos

"I am 68 years old and decided to trade the sport of my Mustang convertible for practical comfort, safety and convenience. I have not looked back at all. This vehicle has been a dream, easy to enter and exit, enough go power so I dont miss the Mustang. I love all the features and couldnt do without any of them! I have the Touring model with everything except AWD. 30 mpg combined. My Aunt and Uncle bought one immediately after I let them drive mine for a weekend! They traded in a Lincoln Town Car. I have put 12K miles on, no problems. I may update this after a 2K+ mile trip this coming week with my daughter, grandson and son in law. I hope it holds up for 10 years! I love it! My advice to anyone: Get one!",pos
"First of all, I have been following different reviews and technical details since the end of 2016. The main reason was I needed the buy great compact SUV which is reliable, safe, fun to drive, and lots of space... The CRV 2017 offers one additional advantage which are smart new technologies, safety or sensing, smart car play. I was not fond of the previous generation design, but when I saw the new design with all of the new changes, I kept researching on the details.",pos
"Purchased used 2 1/2 years ago. Have not had one issue. We service regularly. This vehicle handles Minnesota winters and heavy rains with confidence. We have owned MiniVans, an Envoy, and many other sedans. This 2011 Jeep Gr Cherokee Laredo still looks brand new both inside and out (other than door dings from parking lots). I drive 30 miles each direction to work and use daily for errands, family, and weekends. It is our main family vehicle. We are very happy with all aspects. The gas mileage is exceeding what is advertised for this vehicle - my usual highway driving speed is 72-74. I average 30mpg regularly.",pos
"The Grand Cherokee is the best driving vehicle I have ever owned. This vehicle was purchased in FL so all miles are southern miles, mainly highway. I took a transfer to MA to start 2017 and have a company vehicle and would not be selling otherwise. So the Jeep is currently garaged and always has been- that is why I consider it to be in excellent condition.",pos
"This little Jeep is awesome, I went with the Trailhawk L Plus v6 plenty of power, We dont get a lot of snow in TN. but we did get a little and The Trailhawk never broke traction. Great comfort on road trips and good gas mileage I am a lead foot though. cant wait for vacation to do some off road. The Wife wanted a suv and I wanted a 4x4 so its a win, win.",pos
"I have had this 2014 Toyota Highlander LE Plus for two months. It has excellent room, 2nd row seats have various sliding seating positons, and room for 8 people. The only disappointment in the Toyota Highlander is the front seat comfort. I have adjusted the drivers seat as much as possible, but I am still not comfortable as in some vehicles I have owned. That is my only complaint with the vehicle. I recommend the Toyota Highlander. It has great quality and finish.",pos
"We are in our late 70s and bought this 2016 Toyota Highlander for trips to see our children and grand children. However, my wife has health issues that prevent us from traveling. The Highlander is essentially a new vehicle with less than 3,000 miles. It even still smells like a new car! We have had absolutely no problems with it--other than it is simply too large for my wife to drive. We are selling it to buy a smaller SUV--probably a Toyota RAV 4 or Honda CRV.",pos
My wife and I are the ones who refuse to get a mini van (family of 4..hoping 5)....and after extensive research we decided on a HONDA PILOT LX. We didnt need anything too fancy. We wanted 1. Reliable 2. Comfort. 3. Spacious. So far so good - I test drove many in the mid size SUV and HONDA PILOT won. The mid size SUV feels like a car - steering is extremely easy/non stiff for a mid size. Comfort is great / the extra space in the back makes a difference. We looked at Kia Sorento and Hy Sante Fe...liked both of them but Pilot seemed a hair smoother on the ride / more spacious 3rd / more cargo space. And we got it for under MSRP! We couldnt be happier with our Honda purchase...time will tell if it holds the Honda name and last over 10 years (My old ford explorer in the past did not!!),pos
"Will be keeping this vehicle for a long time. On a recent 2500 mile road trip, averaged over 28 mpg.",pos
"So far its been great. From snow at Paradise Mt. Rainier to the Pacific Ocean beaches. Quiet, smooth, and plenty of go with the 6 cyl. 24+ mpg around town & up to 31 mpg hwy. Only 4K miles but really loving it. Blind spot alert is great, along with courtesy lights, should have opted for leather seats, but have the power drivers seat with lots of lumbar support.",pos
"This is our first Honda vehicle and my wife and I really loved it! We really loved it due to its safety features - automatic hazard brakes, left, right and back sides sensors. The left and right sensors tell me as to when should I safely change lanes!! Our car is pearl black in color with black genuine leather seats. It is a very attractive car both in and out. It is an SUV, which I thought could not be like a luxury car because it runs so smooth and we usually have a very comfortable and excellent ride..!! The average MPG is about 30; hence, a very economical car!",pos
"great all around family vehicle. Getting 32.7 mpg overall and 36 mpg on highway @ 70-75 mph. not tiring to drive on 4hr trips, we get out of car feeling good. Great around town and parking. Love the adaptive cruise control, with all the driver assist features the car almost drives itself. The car will improve your driving skills such as using your turn signals while changing lanes. The car measures your errors and will advise to stop and take a coffee break. Outstanding.",pos
"We bought the redesigned 2017 Subaru Forester Premium with Eyesight technology and all the self-dimming mirror options. Our other 5 Subarus have been great, but this one is the best. We love the acceleration and road holding capabilities in bad weather. At 9000 miles we have averaged 36mpg overall since new. Great car, great value and fantastic visibility. We could no be more pleased.",pos
"I purchased the 2017 Grand Cherokee 4X4 Limited with Tow package, single pane Sunroof, 9 speaker with Sub-Woofer and Nav, all that I was looking for. After looking a big and small pick-ups, SUV offerings from Ford, GM, Toyota, Honda and Nissan took a look at the Grand Cherokee and was really impressed with the styling, fit and finish of this vehicle. Was looking for a vehicle that would give good mileage around town and occasionally tow a small travel trailer and fits in the garage. Rated at 6200lbs towing with the 3.6L this is the one. Was absolutely amazed by the power of the Gas V-6 and 8 speed tranny. Initially was experiencing hard up and down-shifts but as explained in the owners manual the transmission will learn and improve shift smoothness as you train it... sounded strange but its true. Initial hard shifts have smoothed out and other than noting engine speed changing, the shifts are smooth as silk. Mileage in mixed driving has averaged over 22MPG. Highway mileage is over the specd 25MPG. Besides the comfort and appointments of the interior (which is excellent) is this vehicle is quiet. The only flaw was a broken inner door handle that was discovered at delivery and part was ordered, scheduled for and replaced by the dealer 4 days after delivery. I researched the vehicle thoroughly and all the previous issues (transmission, engine, etc.) have been addressed in this years offering.",pos
"I have had old jeeps (cj-7, Cherokee, 2004 Grand Cherokee, and the Commander). This was my favorite jeep - loved everything about it. The way it drove everyday and the way it handled snow and rain. Loved the look and the interior. Was in an accident in this jeep and it handled extremely well.",pos
"This is the first time that I own a Jeep Grand Cherokee and I cannot describe it with word how much I love it. I cant find anything wrong to talk about other than it is a bit too high for me to climb in it, Im only 55 tall, but other than that, no cons!",pos

"own a 2014 crv ex also, the 2018 crv ex is far superior in every category. finally moved the parking brake to the dash board-more legroom. price is still reasonable. after owning over 5 Hondas; accords and crvs, I have never been disappointed.",pos
"Have owned other Toyotas and have always had good luck with them. The 2017 Highlander is no exception. have only had it a couple of weeks, But Im very impressed with it. The build quality is outstanding. With the V-6 engine its very responsive and handles the road very well. the gas mileage is good so far city only is 21.2mpg and city with some highway is 26.5mpg. There is a lot of room inside. Im 6 foot 4 inches and have plenty of leg room driving or as a passenger. Probably the best thing about this vehicle is how wisher quite it is.",pos
"I have owned my 2016 Pilot EX-L with Honda Sensing technology for over 6 months now and driven 6500 miles. We wanted a comfortable, reliable and perhaps foremost a safe car for a family of 4. When testdriving it I fell in love with the smooth, solid and quiet drive the Pilot offered. It felt like a really well put together car with excellent driving dynamics and performance. The Sensing option captured my imagination and have not regretted paying the extra $ 1000 or so for this amazing technology. The adaptive cruise control and lane keep assist really make driving on the interstate and other highways effortless. I was initially somewhat sceptical but after having figured out it's features and limitations I now religiously use it every time. The computer takes over the routine small adjustments of the steering wheel required to keep in the middle of the lane. It also adapts to traffic speed in front of me with a distance selector function up to the upper speed limit I set. I have read criticisms about the abrupt reactions in certain driving situations, however this can be eliminated with preemptive driving and has not bothered me at all. It might not be the best in heavy traffic though. On the other hand it is surprising how these two functions of the sensing technology has reduced fatigue I usually got on longer drives before I started using them. The road departure and collision mitigation system are also great features and peace of mind and who knows when they might in fact become a saving grace. I can very easily imagine that it can indeed avoid a collision due to brief inattention for example. The car does accelerate briskly, braking power could be a little better. It turns around in a surprisingly small radius considering the size of this car. The passenger side rear view mirror camera is also a great safety feature, which took a while to get used to, but now it's easy and makes changing lanes a lot safer for sure. The leather interior is great, very spacious with adjustable legroom even in the second row, with easy to fold second row seats with a touch of a button. Also reasonable third row seats and legroom competing with minivan third rows. We haven't really used the 3rd row and the seats are currently folded for cargo space. The climate control system is really efficient and second row is also very well climatized with separate controls and multiple vents. A feature we love is starting the engine from a distance using the remote key, which helps cool the car down quicker when boarding on sunny days. I cannot fault this car in any way. So far so good and all members of the family absolutely love it.",pos
Great vehicle. Cant wait for summer. Going to travel all over the country.,pos

"My wife and I bought our 2015 Jeep Cherokee Latitude 4X4 with the V6 used with 9K miles on it. We have taken several long road trips (750 plus miles each trips each way) and dealt with one of the wettest/snowiest winters in many years, and our Jeep made it all a true pleasure! We now have 40K miles on our Jeep and have had zero problems with it. We even managed to see 32 MPG on our long-distance drives to another state on Fuel Fighter tires! Our family loves the outdoors and we are avid fishermen, water sports, and camping-hiking types that frequently take our Jeep into the country-side mountains. It has handled every rough-dirt road, mud, snow, and steep roads with ease! Its also nice having the peace of mind with the nearly one-foot of clearance and the all important skid plates that protect nearly the entire undercarriage, oil pan, transmission, transfer case, etc.This and the mountain snows we often have to contend with are the reason we wanted a true 4 wheel drive vehicle and not a AWD SUV. Last winter we had to drive through some flooded areas after a very wet year with no problems at all! We love the tech package as our 9 year old daughter can work on our laptop, her Kindle Fire, and read books, or watch movies. She loves our Jeep so much that she is always trying to find reasons to take it for a ride. Especially with her friends who call it the Robo-car because of the panoramic moon-roof, auto-tailgate, and the female computer voice with which you can tell to change the radio, play a specific song, phone a person, read an email, or dictate your email, etc. Our Jeep is truly the most tech-savvy vehicle my family has ever owned, and a very comfortable interior to boot! And the nearly 9inch computer touch-screen makes everything very easy to access and the GPS navigation map very easy to see and understand. Early last year our best friends retired from 30 years working for a major oil company, and were looking to buy a new SUV. They liked the look of our Jeep and asked us about it. I spent more than an hour explaining and showing all the great features of our Jeep. These are folks with the financial means to buy almost any vehicle they desired but they went to the Jeep dealership the next day and took a fully tricked-out 2017 Jeep Overland for a test drive. They fell in love with it and bought it on the spot. They take it on frequent drives to the San Francisco area, and now have more than 10K miles on it, and say they still find new reasons to love their Jeep! Over the recent Christmas holidays our friends with the new Jeep Overland were speaking with some friends of my brother-in-law who mentioned that they were also interested in an SUV that would be safe for their young family. Our friends took them outside to show them their 2017 Jeep Overland and even let them take it for a drive. The couple fell in love with it so much they went out the next weekend and bought one of their own! My mother-in-law bought a brand new Toyota RAV4 a few months before we bought our Jeep, but after riding in our Jeep she now says she wishes she had bought the Jeep as she loves the interior size, navigation screen, tech package, and 4 wheel drive capabilities of our Jeep!

"I bought this suv to replace my 2015 QX60 that was totalled in an accident. I considered everything from Audi Q7 (in the midst of a model change and more expensive) to MDX,Pilot,Lexus GX,etc. I like Infinitis but did not want to spend more on replacement after losing on the insurance payment in the accident. MDX is a close contender but smaller inside. The current Highlander seems far more refined, quiet, even more luxurious than earlier models. It is on a par with my QX60. Highlanders reputation for reliability and value were persuasive as well. Styling is much better than earlier models. V-6 without turbo (and therefore probably longer lasting), while still having ample power and using regular is a plus.",pos
"I have driven my Summit through blizzards, snow covered roads, roads that were covered in deep water and never has it let me down. I drive around 35k miles a year in the Jeep and the only maintenance other than oil changes, I have ever had to do is replace a sensor. The styling is great, I can tow things with it, the ergonomics are the best in any vehicle I have ever been in. My only complaint is the gas mileage. I own the Penstar V6 and it should get 17 MPG City 24 Highway, but though 95% of my miles are highway I only average 17.5 mpg. Far short of the 24 that is advertised. Though I do drive 5 MPH over the speed-limit so generally at 75 MPH.",pos
A fine car,pos
"I had a 2013 Forester. It was the best vehicle I have owned. I drove it up and down the interstate daily for work for four years before I was slammed into a guard-rail doing 55mph in a snow storm. The entire front end crumbled and the back fender was too damaged to open the back, but the interior looked untouched except for the deployed airbags. No one was harmed with anything more than a slight case of whiplash. Highly recommend, working on getting another one.",pos
"My wife and I have a Lexus GX470 and I traded a Mercedes CLK430 for a Highlander. We looked at the Lexus RX but I cannot stand the new Lexus styling. We test drove the Highlander and we were very impressed. We didn't want all the fancy electronics (like the radar) on the Highlander Hybrid and choose the XLE instead. The interior ride is exceptionally quiet. Everything works and I love the horizontal shelf built into the front dashboard. It doesn't have a wood steering wheel like our Lexus, but the build quality is great. I would highly recommend.",pos
"I drive a mix of hiway and city miles and have hit rain, ice and snow since purchase. Love everything! Comfortable ride, sits high enough to get through unplowed streets easily. MPG is around 29 average. Love all the safety features and the sound system is great. Lots of get up and go.",pos
"We test drove many SUVs before deciding what to purchase. We ended up buying the 2017 Touring Edition. So quiet on startup, cant hear the engine turnover. A nice, quiet drive on the road with perfect suspension. Quiet in cabin, no rattling, road noise is minimal. Responsive steering and light vehicle (compared to our Tacoma. Our first trip was 700 miles with our three dogs. The rear seats folded down flat and the dogs had their very own dog lair. Plenty of room for our luggage and dogs. Highly recommend this vehicle to anyone.",pos
"I recently just survived Hurricane Harvey in the Houston area flooding. I purchased my 2017 Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk V6 in May. This past week, Houston was inundated with close to 50 inches of rainfall causing catastrophic flooding in many areas of the city. Luckily I had my Trailhawk. What this vehicle did was truly legendary. I was at a relatives house in a neighborhood where the water rose to 2.5-3ft deep in the streets, and the water was still rising. In the household we had 4 babies and 2 medically compromised senior citizens in addition to several other adults. One senior is on dialysis 3x weekly and the other is completely unable to walk and is on a wheel chair. We decided to evacuate the neighborhood due to the rising water levels. Their was no help from any city or county ordinances, we basically had to fend for ourselves. I had my Jeep Cherokee fully loaded with passengers and cargo and 2 other vehicles in our convoy, a Nissan Armada, and a Tahoe (neighbors wanted to evacuate with us who had young children with them). I first scouted out the best exit points measuring water depths. We started the evac, my Trailhawk in the lead. The vehicle easily forded through 2.5 to 3ft of water, with no water entering the cabin and handling it all like a champ. In one part we had to off road into a muddy area, the trailhawks 4wd system easily made it through. Unfortunately, the Nissan got stuck in the mud, at a slant with the medically compromised seniors in that vehicle. I luckily had a recovery strap in my vehicle and a nice man close by in the flooded streets loaned me a second strap to get more length. With both recovery straps connected, I hooked the strap from the Nissan to my Trailhawks recovery hook, I put the Cherokee in 4LO and locked the rear differential, and pulled that 6000lb plus fully loaded Armada out of the mud with my little Trailhawk. Once getting the convoy back on track, my Cherokee led the way through devastatingly flooded suburban streets until making it to an area of higher ground and access to the highway system to get to a safe place for the young children and to get the medically compromised people to help. All I can say is that this vehicle is one of the best I have had over the past 20 years of driving. It has excellent handling on the highway, the 271hp V6 has plenty of power and the seats are exceptionally comfortable. The interior components are of high quality and the vehicle is just built solidly. The 4 wheel drive system is amazing, especially having the locking rear differential. I got a great deal when I purchased this vehicle new. There is no other vehicle in its class that can compare. It is great on the highway and excellent off road. I can fit my 1 year olds car seat comfortably in the back and the suspension is excellent for an off road based vehicle. With the roof rails already installed from the factory, I added a Yakima load warrior, where I can put extra cargo and carry extra fuel jerry cans for any situation. I highly recommend this vehicle, because it truly saved a lot of lives that day. Truly legendary, only in a Jeep, kudos to Fiat Chrysler for building an exceptional vehicle that proved itself in a dire situation.",pos
Jeep 4x4 the best....30mpg on a 1200 mile road trip with the v6. Outsells the Grand Cherokee wonder why? Great engineering.,pos
"I previously owned a 2015 AWD CRV touring it was an excellent vehicle although not as good as my new 2017, love this vehicle! and there is nothing I can suggest to improve it. It is roomy, great handling, feels like a very high end automobile and the new sensing safety features that come with the model I have (Touring) are incredible, I dont think you get these features on a Mercedes costing twice as much",pos
"We did out homework and tested our numerous competitors, the Explorer, 4Runner, amd Pilot... but none compared quality to price ratio. This is my third Grand Cherokee and the best yet. The quality is outstanding on the limited. It has every little detail you would find in a luxury SUV. Performance wise it handles well, and the power and fuel economy are very good. We could not be happier with this vehicle and plan on holding onto it for a long time.",pos
"I love most things about the CRV. I know, Ive only driven 500 miles and its been 2 weeks, but I think its gonna be a winner! Its peppy and has all the features to love like awd, good ground clearance, good gas mileage, good cargo, versatility, etc. It has cool new tech Im Lovin, like keyless entry, keyless start, push to start so no more key action. The regular radio interface is terrible but who cares cause they incorporated Apple Carplay (and Android carplay too which Im assuming is equally as good) so its just an awesome interface! Adaptive cruise control is really neat too. So much to love in this car, I highly recommend!!! The small gripes I have so far is theres no great place to put your change and the visibility is ok but not top notch. And thats even mitigated with blind spot recognition.",pos
"My wife has a 2015 Legacy with the 3.6r and Eyesight. I love the pickup and Eyesight makes driving on the highway a lot easier. I bought the Forester with the turbo and Eyesight to get about the same horsepower and features. It sits higher, its easier to get into and out of and the cargo area is fairly huge (new lawnmower fit easily). The 2017 is quiet and rides very well (though not quite as good as the Legacy). I drove in some extremely heavy rain a week ago - admittedly too fast for conditions and the Subby just breezed through 6 inches of standing water and kept me straight. Really felt confident with it. The Touring has some great features and Im still learning the best way to use some of them. My commute includes some small hills and I really like being able to downshift the CVT using the paddles to slow rather than braking. My last car was a nice Mazda 6 with a manual 6 speed and thats what Im used to. For me, this car is almost perfect, I had the Mazda for 8 years and it was still going strong so I was a little worried that I would be disappointed - Im not. It isnt the best looking SUV Ive ever seen, but that really wasnt one of my main criteria. If you buy a Forester that has Eyesight available, you should think about it. Adaptive cruise and lane assist are great. The cruise lets you set the speed and when youre behind that guy that passed you and wants to go 1 MPH slower you can just let the car pace them and relax. Note it also will slow you to your set speed when going down hill using the CVT until it needs the brakes. So far, I havent found anything to dislike.",pos
"I bought the 2015 Cherokee Trailhawk as I frequently drive on dirt roads to visit clients on the reservation. The Trailhawk is the best vehicle in the mud that I have ever owned. I have owned an Explorer, Honda CRV and Toyota 4 Runner. This beats them all completely and have yet to get stuck. The transmission over-revs in the Sport transmission setting; I do not use that function now. The mileage is more than acceptable at an over-all 25.4 MPG. This is a great vehicle, I recently drove to Washington state and averaged 27.2 on the highway. This is the best vehicle that I have ever owned.",pos
"This is my second Toyota Highlander. I could not be happier with this vehicle. It is so comfortable and handles well on the highway. The workmanship and quality of the materials used in the interior of the car are of very high quality. It is very quiet...no wind noise at all. You certainly feel like you are driving a luxurious car at an affordable price.I highly recommend the 2016 Highlander. I gave my 2002 Highlander to my son, and it is still going strong. I never had any major problems with the Highlander in all of those years that I owned it.",pos
"My last car prior to this one was the 2002 Toyota Highlander Limited; I loved that car, but sadly and unexpectedly the transmission died and I wasn't going to pay $500 to fix it, for obvious reasons. I decided to use that money for purchasing a new car. I looked at other cars and strongly considered purchasing the Honda Pilot since I owned a Highlander before. My husband, thank God, convinced me to test drive the 2014 Highlander. The minute I started driving it I knew it was my car. I did buy the Limited model since I had that previously. It drives like a dream and is very sleek. Speaking from owning the first generation, it is vastly different. I love the second row captain chairs! I have two young boys and having their own chairs not only makes them special, but has cut down on the fighting between them. Speaking of which, although feature Drive Speak Easy amplifies your voice so the passengers in the back can hear you, it is a bit of a hassle to turn it on since you have to use the screen to get to it, not very convenient for driving, but I am also not used to having it. So by second nature, I still yell at my sons to be quiet. As for the screen, great to access apps, but using it for the camera, during daylight the glare makes it hard to view it, I have to rely on the back up sensors and look behind the old fashioned way. As far as the handsfree option, when you use the command to try and make a phone call it's response time is slow, I just use Siri on my iPhone to make calls. The navigation, the jury is still out. When we first used the Navigation it was on our way to Oregon. One of the features notifies of heavy traffic or hazards; it supposedly reconfigures the traffic route; however on this particular trip it reconfigured us right into the heavy commute time traffic in Portland, Oregon. I now rely on the WAZE app for my navigation, which is a great app, by the way. I have yet had the need to use features of the Snow and four-wheel drive switches. My old Highlander you would just need to turn on the Snow switch, but this one you need to turn the four-wheel on as well. My old one worked great driving in the snow so I doubt this would be an issue in the newer models. It is a great vehicle when driving to ski areas or when you are on roads that there could be snow. If you get caught in snow you'd be fine. If you like to off road, maybe this is not the vehicle to have, unless you are driving in campgrounds. There are switches for down hill assist and VSC so you have the option of turning off the VSC. As a owner of a first generation model, which it was always on, not sure why their is a VSC switch in the new models. Since my last car did not have the Blind Spot monitor or back sensors and such it took me a bit to get used to them. The Platinum feature which I did not opt for because of price had the Lane Deparature and Brake Assist (or whatever it is called, but you can set your car at a certain distance when on cruise control and when you get passed that it slows the car down). Anyway, to me, if you need to rely on those features, you probably shouldn't be on the road. I like the driver seat memory since my husband is 6'3 it is great to have our own seat settings. In the past it would take me about 5 minutes to adjust the my seat mirrors, not anymore. Overall, I am pleased with this car and would recommend it to anyone that is looking into buying a comfort SUV. I forgot to mention that I also considered the Acura MDX, but for the price this is just as comparable. However, if you are set on name and luxury brands then this is not the car for you, but if you want the luxury and an affordable price you should consider the Highlander.",pos
"Go ahead and test drive the grand Cherokee. Then test the others.. you will be back to get your Jeep! The value, looks, guts and performance can not be compared for what you are getting with other brands. If your staying on the road I recommend the V6 gas engine with the 4WD.. If your going off road alot then step up to the V8 and don't be shy!",pos
"First road trip included 100 miles of gravel roads in the Black Rock Desert and some pretty good hills, the Jeep did great!",pos
"2016 Trailhawk, V-6, Active Drive 2, Selec-Terrain System. Due to its wind-swept aerodynamics, this Jeep handles well in heavy winds. More importantly, I havent had the tranny issues noted in earlier-year Trailhawks. Gas mileage is 24.6 (highway) and 19 mpg (city). The Trailhawks unique Italian-inspired design and muscular stance is eye catching. Something to be aware of: snow chains are not recommended unless you downsize your tires. Apparently, space between the wheel wells and the original P245/66R17 tires is tight and chains may cause damage if the tires are not downsized.",pos
"I fell in love with this car the moment I drove it out of the parking lot for a test drive. Nothing has changed. Absolutely the most comfortable car to ride in and the drive is amazing. My son who is 6'2"" can drive and ride in this car very comfortably. There is tons of storage space and can haul large items with the seats flat.",pos
"My wife and I have already had two Honda Pilots - the last one we had for 9 years. We really wanted to try something different and test drove a lot of cars including Mercedes, Infiniti, Lexus, BMW, Acura, Jeep, and Toyota. We ended up getting the top of the line Elite and have only good things to say about it. To put this into perspective if you go through all the features of the Honda Pilot Elite and price it feature for feature as a Mercedes, it would cost you about $87,000 for an equivalent car. Mercedes make great cars but I would rather save that extra $40,000 for college and take the Honda that will be more reliable, cheaper to run, and have better resale. Whoever led the redesign team - I hope you got a promotion out of this!",pos
"Can't say enough good things about my 16 Pilot Elite, bought new last October and now have 14,000 miles. Comfortable, reliable and safe. My last vehicle was the Mercedes GL350 and this Honda is so much better. The Mercedes was the worst car I have ever owned, constant repairs, and the Honda is the truly a better vehicle and much cheaper.",pos
"We purchased our 2017 Jeep Cherokee about 4 months ago now and are very happy with our Jeep. The Cherokee rides well, the suspension does a great job of absorbing large bumps, the leather seats on our North addition are very comfortable, the interior is very roomy, we love everything about our Cherokee. I am pleasantly surprised with the power of the 4 cylinder engine, dont get me wrong it is not going to win any races, but the 4 cylinder engine in combination with the 9 speed automatic transmission does a good job overall, the 9 speed automatic transmission does good job of selecting the proper gear for the acceleration and road speed,it keeps the engine speed low to save fuel when its possible and appropriate. I was reluctant to buy the 4 cylinder engine at 1st, but since I was not crazy about the idea that the 6 cylinder engine has the start stop feature, shutting the engine at every stop and restarting again, I keep my cars a long time, the car I traded in on the Jeep, I purchased new and was 23 years old when we traded it in and I think the start stop feature of the 6 cylinder version might be trouble down the line? So I opted for the 4 cylinder engine, since the Cherokee 4 cylinder engine does NOT have the start stop feature and could not be happier with the 4 cylinder Cherokee. I m very happy that the Jeep Cherokee was built in Ohio, with a high U.S. parts content, that is a big plus in my book. Thank you Chrysler for making such a great small SUV, me and my wife could not be happier with our Jeep Cherokee, North edition, 4X4.",pos
"I got my Limited with all the high tech options and the base 4 cylinder engine. It has more power than my wifes turbo Buick Encore. It revs a bit but I havent noticed a lack of power. Shifting is smooth and it rides better than my Dodge Magnum. The adaptive cruise control is fascinating. The lane departure actually steers you back in your lane. Self parking works without a hitch. I also love the self dimming headlights, rear reclining seats, and the sound system is excellent.",pos
"Am currently leasing this one...2017 Premium. This is now my fourth Forester. I truly appreciate the small things...IE: The lumbar support is great along with the adjustable height on the seat bottom. The privacy glass is just right. IF you are in need of something more than the basic machine, upgrade to the Premium. I did. This is a great family car and has plenty of room for the groceries and the like. Also a great first car for a young driver.",pos
This is my 8th Honda and my favorite! It does everything right. I love the powerful turbo engine and the great gas mileage. The ride is quiet and comfortable and it handles great!,pos

Car is comfortable, gets good mileage for a big car, is quite on the highway. I traded a RAV4 in, and there is a BIG difference between the two vehicles. Love the third seat, still have lots of storage when the third seat is up. I love the way Toyota takes care of their customers!",pos
Very pleased so far with the overall quality and performance of this vehicle.,pos
"I have had my new Forester Touring for about 3 weeks now, and what a blast to drive. Being my first Subaru, it was hard to decide on the Forester or Outback. They are both great. The Forester is easy to park, and visibility is excellent. The 2017 has been revised with a quieter interior. I chose Saddle Brown leather, and it looks sharp with the dark gray exterior. I love my music, and the stereo is perfect. Much better than a friends Outback. I chose the Forester because of the reliability , and I like the boxy look. It sets apart from other SUVs that look so much alike these days. MPG has been great ...upper 20s for mixed driving. Havent taken a trip yet, but looks like it will be great with the current MPG. I must say the Forester has come along way...I use to not like them as they were very loud with road noise, and rough....not the case now. A lot of vehicle for the money...try one out !",pos
"Its great. I got the Trailhawk version; it is massively built up. It is quite smooth of the highway and massively tough on dirt roads and off-road trips. Its transmission is wonderful on snow, mud, rain. I have never lost control and I am a very aggressive driver.",pos
"I've always purchased Toyota Tacoma or the 4runner, but was not impressed with the latest version of 4Runner. I always bought Tacoma for resale. That said, the Jeep GC has caught my the last two years. I loved the way it 'looked'. My impressions previously were that they were unreliable. I test drove it and was shocked at the materials, fit and finish, and quietness. Felt like an uber luxury SUV. I just couldn't get over how quiet. After doing some research I decided to go with the Summit. So far, I'm supremely impressed. It's a beautiful vehicle and the ride is awesome. Gas mileage is ok. not great. It's inline with what is advertised. The U Connect is awesome and leaps better than Toyota's Entune. My only hope is that long term reliability is ok and resale is good. I eliminated the risk of reliability by purchasing the extended service contract, but the future resale is in the hands of the market. I have to say I'm surprised by the compliments I get on this thing. More in two months than in the years of my toyotas. Personal note, I'm glad I found an American car that I'm happy with. Kudos Jeep.",pos
This is an early review. So far so good. Vehicle was built end of April. Purchased last weekend. Fit and finish is top notch. All panels interior and exterior are well aligned. Pain is glossy with no orange peel. White diamond pearl is a great color. Interior is flawless. Leather seats are of much higher quality than our last pilot. Interior materials are top flight and switch gear feels very solid. Doors close with a solid luxury thud. Low road noise and zero rattles - low NVH). No air leaks. Power train is refined - acceleration close to brisk. Road composure is surefooted and Lexus like in shock absorption. Only gripe is the FM reception (but bought knowing that clarion is issuing a fix in June.) This has a lot of MDX DNA and quality built in.,pos
"I got a basic version - LX AWD. Very happy with the choice. All complaints appear to be about the features that I do not have anyway (touch display, 9sp transmission, sensing, etc.). I am a technical guy, but the level of technology on the basic model is just enough for me. It has everything that I (and my iPhone) need – maybe I would add an outside thermometer (really, Honda? Bluetooth, voice commands, rear camera, but no outside thermometer?) and homelink (otherwise $12 clip-on garage opener from Amazon does the job). I drove 1,000 miles so far and the ride is very enjoyable. I get ~25 MPG average with slightly overinflated tires (36 PSI). For the car of this size and power it is outstanding, IMHO. The handling, acceleration, comfort levels are superb. My wife claims that this is the first car that she can read a book in without getting nauseous. Take it for a ride and you will see what I am talking about. Just make sure that the “economy mode” button is not “on” – it is good on a highway, but for a city ride this mode is sluggish (feels like the “wow factor"" is missing). P.S. I went to YouTube and watched some videos of people abusing 2016 Pilot in off-road winter conditions. It is jaw dropping. Can’t wait for the snow to check it myself.",pos
"I purchased the 2016 EX-L w/Navi in August 2015 after seeing the new body style. I really disliked the square bread box look of the 2015 Pilot and I am very pleased with the look of the 2016 Pilot. I needed the additional seats for 4 grandchildren we spend time with very often. I have been a VOLVO owner for the last 20 years so this was a big change for me. My last VOLVO was a XC90 and I must say I am very pleased with my change to the Honda Pilot. The interior finish, comfortable leg room seating for tall passengers, and the gas mileage are appreciated. It has proved to be a great choice and change for me. There are a couple of things that would be great additions: Adding Lane Watch and defrost to both side view mirrors, adding fold-in side view mirrors, diminish the sewing machine sound the engine makes if you are sitting idle, Improve IMMEDIATE GET UP AND GO acceleration in 1st gear, voice command needs work, volume control is very frustrating. I test drove all of the SUVs in this class and feel I made the best decision to purchase my 2016 EX-L Pilot.",pos
"Great vehicle, driven two long road trips and averaged 32.2 mpg. With in town driving currently at 31.4 mpg. Would have rated it a 10 on driving dynamics but Honda got rid of the blind spot camera contained in the passenger side rear view mirror; my wife and I both loved that feature instead of the warning light. Please put it back Honda. Also the cars dash is currently at maximum peak capacity for buttons to push and features. I watched all the videos when I purchased the car and sometimes still have to access the book for a feature----starting to border on confusing for a senior citizen so be careful Honda.",pos
"This is my first SUV and was purchased to haul my two teen-age sons, a golden retriever and myself on a daily basis. I expect the vehicles I purchase to fulfill their intended purpose very well - my 2017 EX (FWD) CR-V does just that. Great interior design, roomy, plenty of acceleration when needed with FWD in sport mode, easy access, great visibility -- I like the little light that lights up the center console just enough to see:-)Sound system is good but I wish it had a CD player. I put on an after market roof rack and I still get 32 MPG in mixed driving. Great safety features , love the adaptive cruise and auto braking!! To many things to list here that I like about this CR-V - so Ill end with great reliability and resale are a bonus!!",pos
"I bought this puppy for the harsh winters up here back in Dec 2015 and I am not disappointed. It is like riding on a cloud during normal driving conditions. It seems sturdy enough when having to ride over rougher conditions and when the 4WD is needed. I have had zero reliability issues with it. I know most of the complaints about this vehicle are about the 4 cylinder and I will say...spend the money and get the 6. The engine has plenty enough power that wont leave you stranded while trying to navigate the highway at higher speeds or when you need to step on the gas. I am averaging about 22 mpg overall. This will of course vary, depending on your driving habits. Passengers in the back seat are comfortable as well. The size is good as I have no issues parking it and visibility is excellent, especially as I am a 52 driver. My ex, at 63, borrowed it and loved it.",pos
"Great vehicle, jeep has done amazing updating the Cherokee and has amazing features. 10 our 10",pos
"I had a 2007 Jeep GC, and decided to go with a 2010 Toyota Highlander because the engine and transmission and electrical problems of the '07 GC absolutely turned my stomach. Fast forward to 2016 and looking at the new GC, I was impressed. The interior is awesome, and very classy, not a plastic feeling (like the highlander, and my previous GC). The drive is nice and firm, the steering is 100 times better than the Highlander. The feeling while driving on the highway is similar to my girlfriends BMW X3...sporty and quiet. The feel is more of a SUV (truck feel), rather than the highlander (which is Camry based). I am glad to buy American (even if Fiat owns Jeep)..better than the service and treatment I got from Toyota. The Jeep Dealer I went to was world class, and didn't try to push me into something I didn't want. I got what I wanted and I am very pleased with my decision. The rest of the world automakers, your on notice...time to step up your game (actually, your gonna have to wait a few years)!",pos
"I bought my first Grand Cherokee in 2008 during a time when Daimler-Chrysler offered a limited lifetime warranty on the powertrain. I still have that Jeep with over 300,000 miles and it is still going strong. I purchased my 2nd Grand Cherokee in April. To say that I love it is an understatement. It is loaded with most of the latest features including driver assist systems, UConnect, leather, sunroof, tow package, etc. It is a pleasure to drive with the V6 having plenty of power - especially in sport or manual mode. Very comfortable and looks sharp! It does not have 3rd row seating but I don't need it. The 3rd row seating version of this vehicle is the Dodge Durango. The cargo area is plentiful, especially with the seats down. The roof rack also provides additional storage capabilities if necessary. Before purchasing this car, I drove SUVs from BMW, Mercedes, GM, and Ford and chose the Jeep again because of the overall value. We all have our preferences, however, I would recommend to anyone planning to purchase an SUV in this class to at least give the Grand Cherokee a look.",pos
"this is 6th month i am using this car and i love driving this car. so smooth,speed,look and feel in and out of the car. And most I feel like i am driving some ambassador or rich guy car.",pos
"I love my 2014 Highlander. I purchased new in February 2014 and this was my first Toyota. It did not disappoint. I have been driving it for 18 months now and it is just an exciting as the day I drove it off the lot. The interior is what impresses me most, the convenient shelf for my sunglasses and extras. The very large console for my purse, leather seats, cabin lights, sunroof and the blind spot monitoring are its best features to me. Several times the blind spot monitoring has alerted me to a child on a bike or walking on the sidewalk as I'm pulling out. The Traverse required $9000 more for these options. Love it!",pos
"I'm in my 60's. I've had a lot of vehicles, mostly Jeeps. This is my favorite. Very quiet, very smooth riding, able to climb the toughest Jeep roads in SW Colorado.",pos
"the 1st one I was ran off the road by a cell phone fanatic that did not stop, This car saved my life I truly believe that the one and a half inch in dia.bars that run through all 4 doors like a late model stock car saved my LIFE I walked away w/ only a pc. of glass in my arm the size ofless than .2 carrat diamond the car was a complete total Iam convinced the saftey features is why I,am still here.SO I didn't hesitate in ordering the same 2.0 turbo touring model the best car ive owened in 40+years of driving",pos
"We purchased 2017 CR-V AWD Touring model and we are very satisfied with it. All the safety features included in such as Honda sensing and safety ratings on it gives us peace-of-mind. It gives me around 30mpg to/from work, partial HWY and partial city. Interior material is top quality for this category. Turbo engine gives ample power. Very happy with the purchase.",pos
we bought the car a week ago so very early review we had a 10 Avalon for over 7 years my wife wanted an suv looked at so many brands the mid sized and full size suv drove like a truck to her didnt care for that but all the compact suv had 4 cylinders didnt care for that then we found the Cherokee overland v6 power and plush as a bmw try one!,pos
"Let me start by saying I am a sports car guy who has always owned a second vehicle for going off road and sometimes a third for trips or hauling things. So picking a middle market SUV was an odd choice for me now that I can only own 2 vehicles where I live. But I have not been let down. Here's my review hopefully its helpful. I have not been disappointed. This is my 4th Toyota. I think so far its the second best I've owned after my 2004 Tacoma, also really liked my Rav4 sport 6cyl (FAST!). I bought the Highlander last year after having back surgery and really, really looked into what type of SUV would work best. I was having trouble getting in and out of lower vehicles and I needed something that was comfortable due to the extent of my surgery. (bad bike accident) I test drove probably around 15 vehicles before making my choice for the Highlander, so it beat the competition for me on price and value. I am a business owner who drives a lot hauls around a team to techies (5 of them) and is always going to events where I need to haul a Booth (and techies). This thing does it all and recently I have been getting above 25mpg on the highway. City normally around 16mpg. I got through this past winters snow storms thanks the the AWD with snow up too almost 2 feet only got kinda stuck once while driving through a snow drift for fun (I haven't matured fully). Threw on the center diff lock thingy, and it drove right out even with its semi crummy tires. Ride: Pretty good, not as good as my old range rover(2001) good but it doesn't disappoint. I like the sure footed-ness and not to bouncy ride quality. I honestly don't think about it much and that's a good thing. I liked it more than the competition in some ways. Handling: Isn't bad for a larger vehicle but I think it could be better with a more premium set of rubber. I have had a bit of fun on some back roads and have gotten it to oversteer a few times when pushing to hard in a corner. (again crummy tires partially at fault). I don't recommend turning of traction control unless you are a driver who knows how to push the weight of a vehicle like this around corners. All in all it handles a little better than expected but your not going to be beating anyone at the track. (probably best not to try in general) Acceleration: Is pretty good, but for someone who's last vehicle did it in less than 5 secs it seems a bit slow. I actually tested it with a buddy one day and got 6.6 to 60mph which isn't bad for a big lug. I think its gotten better now that the motor is broken in. I was surprised since its 1 second faster than posted. No I wasn't trying on a down hill. It gets on the freeway well and I can pass with ease. I beat my friend in his Audi A4 in a silly drag race. General Driving Dynamics: On a daily basis this thing is fine. Nothing jarringly bad about it. Nothing super impressive either. Its just solid and gets me through the day with out feeling exhausted from driving. Sometimes I wish for more power and better handling but its not really the vehicle for that but a bit more is always nice. Interior: Great! Everything I need. I got the LE Plus trim. I don't need to many fancy things. I hate most GPS's so I am happy to use my mobile phone. I like the way the dash is laid out with the shelf for odd items or smartphones, but sometimes the screen is hard to read in if the sun is coming in at the right angle. Bluetooth works well most people don't know I am talking and driving to them at the same time. All the controls on the wheel are easy to use and in the right places. Controls on the dash are a bit hard to reach with out leaning a bit forward. May be tough for shorter drivers. Seats are great and comfy (main reason I bough it). Tons of room for you and your stuff. Great if you need to drive more than 5 people around. Way back is a bit tight and only small friends or kids should go back there. I don't have kids so I can't do the stroller test but I am planning on that so its ready when they come along. Exterior: It looks ok,from some angles it looks odd overall good design and I don't feel like I am driving a mommy wagon. I got the silver and its a good color. I don't look at it from the outside and its not a show car, so to me it doesn't matter much. To each their own in this department. Disappointments? I don't really have to many. I sometimes wish for a bit more power and quicker steering. I don't like that the options are all over the place with trim levels. I didn't mind spending more but I didn't want a sunroof heated seats or leather. Wish the larger center screen came with the LE Plus version and those cool led lights below the fog lights. Also extra interior lights would be nice but you can only get those on higher trims. Its a bit dark inside when you are getting stuff out at night. I have left things in it since I can't see them. You can't add what you want but I got enough for what I need. Thinking about asking the dealer mechanics if I can add a few things through the parts department. (if its not to pricey) Conclusion: Probably great for anyone wanting a vehicle they can run forever. Abuse with kids or techies, Get through snow and be comfortable and compliant. I drive cars hard and all my Toyota's have never complained or failed. They are the best daily drivers and are good at being reliable transportation. This Highlander is no exception I hope to get 300k miles on this thing. My girlfriend loves it and thinks its the best vehicle we have had and her favorite to take long trips in. (we road trip a lot) Thanks for reading my rather long review hope this helps and is useful for your consideration in choosing a midsize SUV. (pick the highlander) Cheers!",pos
"I love the performance and comfort of this SUV. This is my first Jeep ever and I am so satisfied that I will never buy another brand. There is power, elegance and comfort. Mine is fully equipped and I enjoy every gadget!",pos
This is our 3rd Pilot and by far the best we have ever owned. We were able to get an Elite model which at this time is very hard to fine. I had to wait almost 3 months after placing the order for a white Elite to arrive.My wife drives the Pilot and wanted the second row captain chairs for better access to the third row seats which they provide. She also wanted all the new safety features which are standard on the Elite. My only grip is learning how to work all the controls to take advantage of the safety features.,pos
"I test drove many vehicles in this segment and ended up buying the 2016 Pilot AWD Touring model and think this is the best 3 row/8 passenger SUV on the market. Pros: Provides great value and price point in the segment. Ample passenger space in all rows. Interior is well done, borderline luxury-like as it feels like an Acura. Honda Sensing is great and at a good value. MPG is solid and don't need to shell out for premium gas unlike luxury SUVs in the segemnt. Infotainment screen is large and fairly responsive. Blind spot camera is a nice feature. Drive is smooth and powerful, accelerates quick off the line. Don't get why people complain about the push button transmission, I think it's done very well, each button has either a different tactile feel, clicking motion or size and looks very modern. Garmin GPS system is much better than stock GPS units you see in most cars. Paddle Shifters are a nice and gives a sporty feel. Also, you wouldn't expect it, but it's one of the best in class for offroading, traction control and AWD systems, just check out the Fast Lane Tests on Youtube. Big plus for me was the availabillity of an HDMI port and electrical outlet for Rear Entertainment System. The 2nd row Sunshades are a very nice feature as well, especially when you have small kids. The 20 inch rims are very stylish as well. The Cons: No Carplay/Android Auto (HUGE Oversight, especially for a car that's advertised as the ""Modern"" family vehicle.) No HDMI input for infotainment screen (C'mon, at the very least, include this if you're not giving us Carplay/Android Auto). The cargo space isn't that large when using all seats. And while the exterior styling is MUCH improved from that hideous box design, I wanted/expected more. The car does look much better in person than in pics though. Overall, considering the features and value, I think the 2016 Pilot is best in class.",pos
"A lot of reviews shown are for older year models. The 2017 I have gets 34+ Hwy and 28+ city. The backup camera screen is larger than before. I like the visibility and headroom a lot. So, comfort and mileage are the reasons I bought this model. Paid invoice, around $25k",pos
"The CR-V was the overall winner after driving every single SUV rated in the top 5 by the top 3 evaluations, we bought the touring model super impressed",pos
"From the moment I drove it, was in love with it.",pos
Great overall vehicle; smooth drive and turning with good power. I love this car!!!!,pos
"I like everything about my 2016 AWD EX Pilot. I've driven it around town, along the snaking Blue Ridge Mountain Parkway, and on a 1,000 mile interstate trip. It's very comfortable/roomy, maneuverable/park-able, and pretty darn peppy. So far so fantastic.",pos
"Yes, and in fact did! We loved my Cherokee so much that when my husbands car died, he bought a Cherokee, too! We live in a hilly area, get fair amount of snow, so 4WD is more than just nice, it can be essential for getting to work. This Cherokee is the most comfortable vehicle weve had, and we just love the bluetooth connectivity. The backup camera is so clear and easy to use. Do yourself a favor and take one for a test drive.",pos
"I have a 2014 Cherokee limited purchased new that now has 30,000 miles and I havent found another vehicle like it in comparison. Its quiet ,comfy ,and powerful . The only things I think Jeep should change is vented front seats and power seat for the passenger , otherwise great vehicle. My wife loved mine so much she bought a 2015 Cherokee Latitude .",pos
"I previously owned a 91 Camry, 03 Highlander, 06 4-Runner and 07 Camry. This time I was leaning towards a 4-Runner, but after taking another look at the new Highlander I decided to purchase. I went with the Limited edition (with Driver Tech package /AWD / Blue-Ray player/ Towing package). I also decided on the White Blizzard Pearl color; which I think is the best looking of them all, second choice would have been silver. I also looked at the Platinum Limited (PL) version however couldn’t find it in White, in this area. The only main difference between my Limited (with my added options) and the PL is the PL has the heated rear seats & steering wheel and the full panoramic moon roof; I really didn’t need either of those options. I wouldn’t get the Limited without the Driver-Technology package; it’s a little expensive but I think it’s got some nice features (mainly safety). The Towing package comes with a heavy duty radiator with oil / trans cooler (nice for general towing or even if you live in an area with a hot climate). Also, the Limited has the JBL radio, the heated & vented front seats and various other standard options, i.e. led running lights, puddle lights, blue interior lighting accents, and various other things (research). It took me a few days to figure out all the bells & whistles. Now that I’m accustomed to this vehicle I’m pretty happy with my purchase. If you want an “all-around” SUV, especially if you have kids, or you will be using it in snow country (considering the AWD option) then this may be the SUV for you. If you do live in snow country you may want to consider the PL model, hence the heated rear seats/steering wheel options; however you won’t get the Blue-Ray for the kids. If you will be doing more off-roading or live off- the-grid then you may want to look at the 4-Runner. At the end of the day I think this was the best choice for us. Did I mention this thing is loaded? When the trial Sirius Radio and the Toyota Safety Connect runs out I will be renewing, I’m spoiled now.",pos
"I spent weeks checking comparing and driving about 6 different SUVs. We finally narrowed it down to the CR-V, Sportage and the Ford Escape. The Honda won out because we liked the fit and the way it drives and handles. I drive almost 65 miles a day and so far am getting about 29 mpg.. First road tip coming in August to Dallas Georgia so well see how it goes..",pos
"I traded in my 2014 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Rubicon for a 2015 Altitude. It had everything I wanted and for a great lease payment. It's such a smooth ride and my only comlaint is the vehicle is not available with Navigation from the manufacturer which means I lose out on HD radio and Travel Link. Other then that I love the vehicle. Top things I like is exterior appereance. It looks like the Overland but $9,000 less money and I'm a big fan of the suede/leather interior! the creature comforts are amazing and it's everything I need!",pos
"Perfection. Big camera for rear view; lane assistance alert; beeps all over for safety alerts; comfort seats; appearance is terrific; customer service at dealership is outstanding; smooth drive, even smooth over street speed bumps/humps; all kinds of hi-tech features on touch screen; very easy to learn tech features; smart looking running boards; roomy; I own a 2015 limited; just sold a Sienna for this Highlander; both awesome vehicles; fun to drive and easy to maneuver; perfection.",pos
"I've owned the AWD Limited Platinum for over 6 months and couldn't be much happier with it. I test drove and researched many competitors, but it came down to this and the Acura MDX (AWD base). They were both around the same price, but of course you get all the bells and whistles with the Toyota, and I am so glad I did. Also, I actually preferred the ride and steering over the Acura. The steering feel is excellent...nice and tight. At the same time the ride is extremely smooth so you really get the best of both worlds. So even with the base V6 you will still enjoy the great ride. The bucket seats in the rear, suit our 4-member family perfectly. The amount of space back there, makes it a great place to be. The panoramic sunroof and heated steering wheel are as nice as expected. However, I was surprised by how much I use and appreciate the blind spot monitoring and the adaptive cruise control. I highly recommend this vehicle.",pos
"We have already taken it on a long distance trip and just as around town driving, it excelled. We have had several Honda products previously and they have always performed and handled as expected. The Pilot handles wonderfully both on the road and around town. Even when we put 8 people in it and drove on mountain roads I was impressed with both the power and handling. Returning home, fully loaded with luggage, three adults and two bulldogs, a/c running, we averaged 32 mpg on the first tank and 29.5 on the second tank. Plenty of room for us, the dogs, family children while roaming around town too. Feels luxurious inside and handles great!",pos
I have bought many new cars. All I can say is that this is on of the best I have ever owned.,pos
"After much review and test driving all the comparable small SUVs, it came down to a Rouge or a CRV for me. I liked both a lot and think they are way out ahead of all the rest. I found they both had pretty equal safety packages, which was important. I finally picked the CRV because #1/I liked the drive slightly better #2/ It beat the Rouge on MPG and #3/The CRV was compatible with Android Auto. Android Auto basically allows you to plug in your cell and fully access phone/texts, music, Google Navigation and Maps, hands-free through the cars nice sized monitor. It is awesome and all starts by just saying ok google. No restrictive navigation system to update (). Google updates free and automatically.",pos
"Purchased my Trailhawk several months back. My family already owns a 2014 Grand Cherokee which we love and has had 50k trouble free miles so far. I've mostly been a sporty sedan guy, owned stuff like a 2007 Civic SI, GTI's, 2011 Audi A4 and 2014 Cadillac ATS4. But my hobbies like mountain biking and skiing made it pretty obvious I needed something more versatile. One test drive in the trailhawk and I was sold. The V6 makes solid power and so far has averaged 21mpg in 60% city traaffic, which is only 1mpg worse than my ATS. Handling is spot on and handles bumps and rough roads with ease. Is obviously is not sporty, but the quick steering and lack of body roll make for a entertaining drive. The interior is quiet, very well laid out and the seats are among the most comfortable I have sat my booty in. The Uconnect 8.4 is super easy to use. There is plenty of rear seat leg room even for my 6'4"" dad to sit behind me. The V6 with tow can handle 4500lbs which crushes other small SUV's. It is a beast in the snow and sand and gives plenty of confidence when road disappears. My only complaint is the 9sp transmission is a little slow to shift and too eager to stay in economy mode. But it shifts smoothly. Also the back cargo area is okay size wise, but could be slightly more ample. Love it.",pos
"I reviewed our 2015 Cherokee Latitude 4x4 V6 back in Oct so this is just an update. Our Cherokee now has 23k miles on it without any problems whatsoever. We bought it used (9K) last February and have taken it on many dirt roads (fishing, camping, etc., excursions), and are now in the midst of our 2nd winter (snow & ice) and we love its solidness and handling of all driving conditions, while enjoying the luxurious comfort and technology of the interior. We have consistently gotten between 22 – 24 MPG in overall driving and when we took a road trip from Reno to my brother’s house in Hesperia, CA, we were amazed with 30 - 31 MPG (almost all highway driving) both ways. My mother-in-law’s 2016 RAV4 is much noisier from road/wind/engine noise than our Jeep, and the RAV4 also has hard, cramped seating. All my 8 year old daughters friends love to ride in the jeep, and call it the “Robo-Car” because of all the high tech features such as ‘talking’ with the on-board computers female voiced assistant for everything from requesting a specific song to reading/composing emails, etc. We love our Jeep!",pos
"Overall, super impressed with the Cherokee Trailhawk v6! With only 1k miles on it so far, I can't think of any cons. Its comfortable, stylish, drives great on and off road and has amazing technology options. Its heated seats and steering wheel, as well as the automatic starter come in handy in the winter/fall months in NY. I would 100 percent recommend the trailhawk v6! Get out and test drive it!",pos
"Let me start with saying that I’m a Mazda guy. I owned 8 Mazda in 15 year period. My wife drives 2016 CX-5 GT model and we love that car. I had 2011 CX-9 GT with to many miles, so it was a time to get a new car. Went to Mazda to see what I can get for cheap, like $250-$300 per month lease. Liked the new 2017 CX-9, but it was to expensive. Then my brother told me that Subaru has cheap lease specials. Same day went to see what will I like. I liked the Outback but it was to slow with 2.5i engine option. Outback is much heavier then Forester. So I end it up leasing 2017 Forester because the cheap lease special ($250 per month tax included. $400 down) and the way it drives. This is my second Subaru. The first was 2007 Impresa 2.5i. I loved that car. Drove 95K miles with zero problems, that’s why I decided to get Forester. So far I’m very satisfied. Good acceleration, good MPG for AWD, very comfortable seats. AWD is a big plus. Good handling, very nice and quiet ride. I love all the safety futures, lane assistance, blind spot monitor and break assist. New entertainment system is awesome; 7” touch screen is very easy to use. Backup camera is OK, low quality when it’s dark. The only concern I have is the towing capacity only 1500lb. I have a trailer with 3 dirt bikes on it. Total weight is 1400lb, so I should be OK I hope))) I drove both 2016 and 2017 Forester. 2017 has a better CVT transition (more responsive), less road/wind noise, better interior and looks meaner))). Over all I enjoy driving this car.",pos
"I have a 2016 with a HEMI, Platinum pack and Rear entertainment system. Holy smokes is all I am going to say. I drove this one first and then drove an Audi Q7, Acura MDX, BMW X6, and Lexus GX460. This has the most stuff/options for the lowest cost of them all and has the biggest engine and the nicest interior (The MDX interior is a close second and the Audi handling is a close second). I am loving it so far!",pos
"This is the third CRV I have owned (08,13,17) it keeps on getting better. I love all the new safety features. They all got great mileage this one averages 30 mpg city/highway. This time I went up a model to EXL Loving the dual temp, leather interior and the wood trim adds class.",pos
"Upgraded to a 2017 EX-L from a 2014 LX. Installed Weathertechs and had the sill guards installed. Just simply a brilliantly designed and built vehicle. The Android Auto works very well. The EX-L is the best choice in bang for buck in the CR-V lineup, its a less frills version of the Touring and has the best estimated 3/5 year value of the other trim levels. Another cool thing is that it came with top of line tires which is very unusual! Hot tip: Installing Weathertechs greatly quieted the vehicle!",pos
"I have owned Honda products all my life but to go from a box style suv to a sleek aero-dynamic look with all the new technology is incredible. It drives fabulous, plenty of power, and the leather seating is very comfortable. Well worth the money.",pos
"This is my second Honda in 3 years. I purchased a 2012 CRV back in 2012 (still have it and love it); you can see my original review of the CRV dated March 18, 2012 under the title ""EXCELLENT ""SUV"" for the Money!"" and an updated review of the CRV in May 29, 2013. Needless to say, I like the Honda brand and purchased a 2016 Pilot Elite. Let's get to the Pilot. With a growing family, I test drove multiple 3 row SUV's and the one I felt ok with the most was the Highlander...until I heard about the new Pilot coming up so I waited. Very GLAD I waited! First impressions of the Pilot were very very good. I wasn't crazy about the design in pictures, but in person it's a different story. Exterior was very sharp and very pleasing on the eyes. From the A pillar back, it looks beautiful, I just wish they put a little more effort in the front end design (not ugly, but not my favorite part of the vehicle). I love the wheel design too. Very Audi and Mercedes like. Inside, if you go with a Touring or Elite, it almost feels like you are sitting in a luxury vehicle, and yes, I've owned multiple luxury vehicles, I know the feeling :-). Very very minimal use of plastics, most of the cabin is soft touch materials that you find in Audi, Mercedes, BMW, etc... The cabin and dash are not cluttered with buttons and levers everywhere, it is very simplistic, classy and clean (almost Audiesque). I saw a couple of complaints about the touch screen in reviews, but I had no problem, feedback was quick and easy to use. If you see my CRV review, you'll know how much I hated Honda's infotainment system, so with the new Pilot, first impressions were, wow, Honda finally put some money into this! I love it so far. The seats are very comfortable and upscale (everything in that car feels upscale if you go with Touring or Elite). The second row seats were just as comfortable as the first row. Plenty of USB and charger plug-ins in the back for kids. One of the most important things for me was the third row room and trunk room while the third row is up (trying to avoid a minivan...yea yea I know, they are the most practical for families). You can easily and possibly comfortably fit a 6' person back there; anyone under that size will be very very comfortable. I personally sat back there and will be happy to sit back there for a long trip, it's a pleasant place to be. The seats weren't quite as comfortable as the second row, but they are comfortable enough, and definitely way more comfortable than the competitions. I opt'd for the Elite because of the captains chairs and the ease of access to third row since it will be occupied; my only complaint from initial impressions is that you have to go with the Elite to get the captains chairs. Also, I am giving the interior design a 9 here instead of a 10 because if you get the bench seats and have car seats (not booster seats) on each side of the bench seat, you can't move the bench seat forward to allow someone access to the third row (hence the reason why we opted for captains chairs); so my issue with that is why haven't manufacturers copied Infiniti's second row design where it tilts down and slides forward with a car seat to allow access to the third row (check out the Infiniti QX60 second row design on youtube...pretty cool). I guess Honda wants you to pay for the Elite to get the captains chairs. Next step was if I can at least fit a double stroller in the trunk while the third row is up...yep! and with room to spare for groceries. Lastly, the drive. Driving impressions were pretty good. Very quiet, very smooth, a little on the artificial side of feedback from the wheel (but hey, it's not a sports car so who cares, right?). Throttle response can be a little bit better too. So those are my initial impressions of the 2016 Pilot. Overall a big 10. I keep telling myself I am so glad I did not end up going with the Highlander or the Infiniti QX60 (except for that seat design in the Infiniti that I love) because the Pilot blows them out of the water! I'll do my usual updated review after about 20,000 miles of driving. If you're looking for a 3 row SUV, get yourself into a Pilot, you'll LOVE IT!",pos
Would recommend this car to anyone looking for a SVU. Had a 2011 Highlander and this one 2014 is such a great improvement. Nav system is far better and can do a lot more with it. Ride seems to be smother than older models. Gas mileage is also very good.,pos
I had been driving Suburbans for about 20 years and decided I was done with large vehicles after driving a small SUV for my daughter from Florida to Oklahoma. I was seriously looking at the Nissan Rogue and Toyota Rav4 when I stumbled upon the redesigned CRV at a Honda dealership. We have had 4 Hondas in the past and everyone of them lasted forever with minimum trouble or maintenance so I had to stay loyal to Honda. We bought the Touring model AWD and it had everything I wanted for creature comforts except the cooled seats. I ABSOLUTELY love this car. Has the 1.5L Turbo and does very well in most circumstances for acceleration. I have been getting 30+ MPG in the city. I get slightly less on the highway when speeds start reaching above 65. Between 45-65 I think I average about 35 mpg and about 27-28 mpg when above 65. The interior is not of the highest quality materials but it works great for us and looks nice. The controls are easy to use once you learn about them. I have zero regrets about buying this vehicle and am looking forward to driving it for a long time.,pos
"SO I test drove almost all the SUV's in the market before deciding on the Toyota Highlander Platinum edition 4WD. It is hands down among the best driving SUVs out there. It is quite and very comfortable to drive it. The Toyota Entune Infotainment system is responsive and up to date. You will love the extra shelf on the front console for your keys and your phone. A huge side storage between the driver and the front passenger seats. I have not yet used the third row seats so I can not give a feedback on those. Overall, no regrets whatsoever.",pos
"I have owned 4 SUV's, including two Ford Expedition Eddie Bauer editions. I decided I wanted something with better mileage and after driving seven different brands, I opted for the 2014 Toyota Highlander. I choose a Limited version w/ an MSRP of $43,903 and got an excellent deal by working two dealers until I got the price I wanted. The vehicle is one month old tomorrow and it is simply fantastic. Love all of the features, the steering and ride is nothing short of perfect. I'm tall and on the heavy side, but I fit in the Highlander as easily as I do my Expedition. Gas mileage is outstanding and my family loves it too. If you're in the market for a new SUV, drive the Highlander....you won't be disappointed!!!",pos
The 2014 Toyota Highlander is a fun SUV to drive. I did my homework before purchasing and boy did it pay off ! My whole family loves driving it. The new interior is really roomy and awesome. Can't wait to go on the weekend to the beach ! Anyone who is really in the market for a new SUV should seriously look into this ALL new Highlander. It won't disappoint ...: ),pos
Sport Utility that handles like a sports car. Average gas millage 18 to 24 . Have to keep looking at my speed on highway don't realize how fast you are going,pos
love my jeep trail hawk! drives great off road or highway..no problems..best one so far,pos
"It is more than I expected. I first saw the pictures of it from the Chicago Auto Show & immediately called my dealer to inquire when they would be available. I ordered it May 1st & took delivery of it June 18th. Fantastic vehicle, well worth the price. It is a macho vehicle vs the Odyssey which is more a mom""s car. At first glance you can see a big brother appearance in the front to the CRV & in the back a similar comparison to the Odyssey.",pos
"Love this Jeep, ride is outstanding handles great, my Trail Hawk is an off road Jeep vehicle love it",pos
"Purchased the Jeep Cherokee in August 2014 and have not been disappointed. I read and researched thoroughly, including possible software issues with transmission,and felt the risk was low compared to many positives (value, ride, style and interior, room in rear, 8"" control display, mpg). The transmission has been fine, no complaints. Yes, they have had a few minor recalls, but saved them and went in only twice, each time getting a free oil change and car wash, as well as ride to/from home. I like the service. I would definitely buy again. Since I have another AWD SUV, I didn;t both to get the 4x4, since there is not much snow in Dallas.",pos
"I traded from a 2016 Acura MDX to a Touring CR-V and I can honestly say it feels like a slightly scaled down version Acura. Sure the performance cant match the Acura, but its a sprightly driver, it handles well, its nimble to park and is spacious for such a small footprint. I am more than willing to give up a little acceleration, and really its not that much acceleration, for a huge jump in mpg and on regular instead of premium. The seats are very comfortable and Im a big guy and can comfortably sit in the backseat behind my drivers seat setting. As far as electronics, its very similar to the Acura in terms of the audio, lighting, door and window optional settings and the LED lighting including the headlights is great. I understand they put a volume button back on the dashboard but it really needs a tuning knob too. It does not have a CD player but no car will probably have one in a few years going the way of 8 tracks and cassettes. I wish it came with a panoramic sunroof like the Canadians get. I gave up only a couple features like the CD player and an auto-adjusting steering wheel, but gained automatic hi-low headlights and the remote start. Ive been getting around 28-29 mpg in town and have gotten as good as 36 mpg on the highway on a road trip. Hondas have always been noisy but this is overall pretty quiet, but you do hear wind noise at highway speed. It isnt the roar of tire and wind noise of old from Honda though. I like the front end and profile a lot, it makes it feel more substantial but the rear end needed a little more work. The taillights are cool but it didnt need a big chunk of chrome between them trying to compete for attention. Honda could have put the chrome strip lower above the rear license plate area and it would have looked better. The back end isnt all that pretty but it sure is functional and there is a ton of storage space in back and the kick under the bumper opener works well. Overall my gripes are pretty minimal, because so far its showing itself to be a really comfortable, practical and pleasant driver that delivers lots of luxury features at an affordable price. Im not missing my Acura at all.",pos
"I have been driving my EX AWD for one month now. 2/3 of my driving is in a heavy stop-and-go SF East Bay traffic and about 1/3 driving on city free-ways to neighbouring towns. I am getting 27.3 mpg combined. On a highway I was getting close to 34-35 mpg. My former car was 2008 Rav4 Sport with 270hp V6 which was basically a rocket. So, I had to do a lot of driving adjustment, since the 1.5L Turbo engine is quite sluggish. But, surprisingly if you put in a sport mode (S), it starts to feel really sporty and handles San Francisco hills with ease and grace. Everything is great, the ride is comfortable, the handling is sharp, mileage is great, the front exterior looks now nice and serious (unlike the previous models wrinkly ss look). Except the rear exterior still looks like a fat & wrinkly ss from 2016 model. Honda, make it smooth and clean as 2017 rav4 or 2017 Kia. I love the front LED daylight running lights. Nice design. Some, I read, want to do away with the moon roof. I disagree. I love it. On a hot summer day, really helps with fresh air. Alloy Wheel design is very cool and artistic. What actually swung my decision to buy honda this time, is its change to digital display. It is beautiful. I used to have it on my old 1992 Mercury Sable, and after that I always cringed at the analog speedometers. Now back to digital. Yey! One issue, which my dealer is fixing now, is the passenger side rear door window - was not properly seated and was giving screeching sounds when rolling down or up. Hope it will get fixed. As far as the slap-on tablet like Entertainment screen - I love it. Works fast, except for the bluetooth - is quirky. Sometimes it cannot find you phone. But sometimes connects immediately. What I like the best - is Pandora. So, do this, before turning your car on, turn on your bluetooth, data and Pandora app on your phone, then turn on your car and select Pandora from Audio Source. It should connect without issues in 90% times. The Android Audio on the other hand is clumsy.",pos
"Traded in our 2012 Highlander SE for the 2014 Limited. To say the least the improvements Toyota made on then Highlander are extraordinary! Better inside and out and sooo much quieter ride and smooth handling. We got the Limited over the XLE because we wanted the heated/cooled seats and the JBL stereo system. XLE is probably the best value but we love the one we got. Check out the new silver color too, it's not like the plain silver on other Toyota models, it's called silver sky and has a light blue tint to it that nicely sets off the chrome and black trims. Highly recommend so far!",pos
"I'm a Loyal Toyota customer and #1 satisfaction owner who drove (2 Toyota's and went for another one decided looking at new crossover. LUV my new Highlander has better features than 4Runner was considering buying again since had a 2003 brand new without having any mechanical problems and excellent gas mileage too. The Highlander is more quieter got a really high performance ride and has Lexus interior and new looks to it. I have a 3rd row seating its comfortable and the seats folds flat down or having more room. Navigation is better and the devices behind are a plus on earning overall best value ever. Has effortless handling I got heated seats, rearview camera, Bluetooth, xenon headlamps and lots of space for used to be a small crossover with the luxury price to it but now has changed so much on the 2014 model I have bought for the money. I think it looks better from other Toyota SUVs as Venza, RAV4 and 4 Runner its bit luxury and has a greater ride than ever. Have good quality storage spaces whenever needed for more and probably got a greater towing capacity too as is haven't tried yet on hooking a trailer or boat yet. There isn't no shortcomings can think on Highlander a great SUV worth a better price on upgrade style and better interior features.",pos
"When the new Cherokee came out I thought, ""Ugly!"" Who'd buy one of those? But, when our beloved 2004 Grand Cherokee was wrecked, we needed to buy another Jeep. We went to our local dealer, bent on buying a new Grand Cherokee but decided to drive a Cherokee Trailhawk with the 3.2L engine and 9 speed automatic transmission. We bought one, looks aside. It's looks grew on us. We had a trip planned to the San Juan Mountains in Colorado, early this summer, in our 2000 Jeep Wrangler but when we discovered it had a differential fluid leak, we took the Trailhawk. We ran some pretty tough trails and it shined. The independent 4wheel suspension has limited articulation but, the electric rear axle locker more than makes up for that. We would say it earned it's ""Trail Rated"" badge. It is economical, powerful, comfortable, and great to drive. It is a ""real"" Jeep! So far it has had ""zero"" issues.",pos
My 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee Overland 4X4 with the Pentastar V6 has been outstanding. It goes anywhere and gets there in style and comfort. So many amazing features.,pos
"Traded my 2012 CRV due lack of power, but didn't realize how much of a ride quality I was also missing. I average over 600 miles a week, so safety and security is a must. Driving has never felt so at ease and comfortable in the Highlander.I feel much more in control and confident driving in bad weather. The 6th vehicle I've purchased, and by far the best vehicle purchase to date.",pos
"Wow... Just picked up my 2014 Highlander this week, and it is awesome! Much different from my 2008 Highlander, eventhough it was great too. I will start by saying this is about the most quiet SUV I have ever been in. Smooth as silk ride. I have most everything that comes with it except the DVD. The leather seats are extremely comfortable , and the driver seat has plenty of seat adjustments. The safety features are fantastic: Lane departure, blind spot, parking assist, auto cruise control, back-up camera with wide screen. The bridgestone tires that mine came with are very quiet, and they look great! The JBL system is sweet, and all the apps are fun to try as well. Easy to use controls are great ! The new 6 speed trans. is very smooth...you hardly feel the trans. shift at all.There is plenty of leg room both front and back, as well as head room. The panoramic sunroof is awesome and lets in alot of light. It is very fun to drive. I test drove a Lexus RX350, and there is no comparison. highlander is more quiet and smooth, and offers a lush interior and plenty of options. Try one out...you will love it !",pos
"Picked up my new CRV-EX-L Mar 7 in Ohio. Drove it the 1065 miles back to Texas that week. Great mileage at 34 mpg highway doing about 70 mile per hr most of the trip. It handled the hills in Ky and Tenn with no effort. Have been getting 28 mpg in the city as quoted by Honda. Has the right amount of power, handles great, and a lot of great comfort features. I recommend the EX - L package for the extras. My only disappointment was lack of a CD player. I also own a Highland which is also a great SUV but the CRV is more nimble. And I love the Honda Sensing safety features, makes it easier to drive.",pos
Aside from a few recalls - its been a great ride! this is my 10th jeep and I am glad I bought it!,pos
"What's not to like about the newly designed Forester (2014)? Hardly anything: the shorter wheelbase creates a bit of a bumpy, firm ride. The CVT transmission revs up loudly when you push the pedal down to accelerate onto the freeway. That's it! But things to like far outweigh those. A true 31.3 mpg driving over thousands of miles in the mountains and on interstates at 70 mph. An interior that is huge and comfortable for all---even the backseat passengers. Tinted side windows that block lots of sun. A huge sunroof. Electric driver seat that moves forward-back, up-down, tilt forward-back, and the lumbar adjustable seat back that tilts too. An oil filter on top of the engine that's easy to change. Beautiful metallic paint. A price negotiable to under $25000 for the premium level trim. No repairs as of yet after almost 60 K miles. All-wheel-drive that handles Colorado's deep snows with 8 inches clearance. A fairly decent information monitor with lots of different data screens. (The newer ones are even better (2015 and 2016). Subaru has things all figured out with these cars. It's our second after the 1998 Forester's engine finally died at 273,000 miles.",pos
"I was really having a tough time sorting through the countless crossovers out there. I was vacillating between the Ford Explorer, the Nissan Pathfinder and the Infinity QX60. Once the 2014 edition Highlander came on the market, we went for a test-drive and we were sold. It has many improvements over the 2013 model. My favorite is the XLE edition, which allows one to have leather seating without having to add all the extra superfluousness of the ""limited platinum."" You will get amazing value on the XLE. The suspension is really smooth over speed bumps and while doing 80 on the freeway. They did a great job on soundproofing - you'll need to look at the speedometer to realize how fast you're going. The turn radius is pretty tight, especially for such a large car. Braking is outstanding - it is evenly distributed and the distance is short. The low-end torque is decent, once you realize how heavy the car is and that it gets fairly good MPGs, even around town. If you have two young ones, or are about to, I would highly recommend the highlander. They will appreciate the standard second row sun shades and the tri-zone climate control. You even have a ""speak-easy"" function where you can talk to them through their speakers without having to turn around.",pos
"We especially like the new 6 speed transmission. It allows use of cruise control, even on hills without revving up the engine as much as earlier models. The seats are more comfortable than earlier models. Gas mileage is similar to earlier models, ie 22-25 MPG on the interstate. It also provides the solid quiet ride we expect from a Highlander. We miss the power passenger seat on our XLE model. We liked the LE model but needed 8 passenger capacity not available on the LE model. We replaced a 2008 Highlander with over 200,000 miles for this vehicle. We had no problems with it and expect the same quality and reliability with our new one. I'm sold on the new one.",pos
"Amazing power in a luxury ride. Smooth, powerful, quiet and loaded with features.",pos
"We traded our 2004 GMC Envoy with 208,000 miles, 3 weeks ago for the EX-L and are loving it so far. We live in the mountains and the Envoy was getting 14-15 mpg and starting costing us for repairs. I did my research and couldnt find a reason not to purchase a CR-V. The 2017 was much better than the 2016 and was a no brainier for us. We are averaging 31 in the mountains and 34 on the highway! Love pulling up to the gas pumps and putting in 10 gallons compared to 23 for same miles driven with the Envoy. The CR-V doesnt ride as smooth as the Envoy and isnt as quiet but the gas mileage more than makes up the difference to us.",pos
"we have the EX-L w/o nav, 3,000 miles so far, about 60 percent city and a solid 33 mpg average (We drive it like a gramma). No issues except the rear visibility is horrible but the same can be said of most cars these days. Guess thats why they put backup cams in them.",pos
"Couldn't even finish the test ride in the Forester. Turned around because it was just awkward.  Hard to handle.  Not as responsive as the Outback.  Very uncomfortable seats.  However, good visibility and you sit up high.  I would be exhausted after a long drive in this suv.",neg
"-85-88dB on 120-130km

"My fifth Subaru. Bought my first in 1973. I've been a satisfied return customer several times. However, the intermittent lurching on slow acceleration, which has been evident since I purchased this 2017 Forester 17 months ago (current mileage approx 15,000 miles), is both annoying and dangerous. 

I am very disappointed in Subaru of America's failure to address this problem. Time to move on.",neg
"compared to my old subaru outback this new forester is a disappointment, wish I had kept my old subaru and gotten it fixed",neg
This is all you could ask for in a compact SUV. The best of all I test drove. Great for around town or long trips. Very good gas mileage.,neg
"This is my sixth Subaru since the early 90's.  The Forester has been reliable, but I'm not certain of its long term durability.  This is a 1.5 year old car with rattles, a jumpy transmission and a poorly designed and constructed interior.  Center console is trashed.  USB ports are designed so any accessory cord breaks the port.  Accelerator is problematic and very touchy.  Headlights are terrible at night and have already burnt out, which of course is not covered under warranty...  Engine has rattling valves and burns oil like its going out of style.  Dealers say this is normal.  My sixth and last Subaru.",neg
"Very uncomfortable. Many below par features.
Very disappointed after such high ratings. Most other owners I speak to also are disappointed.",neg
"I bought a brand new 2014 Subaru forester because they claim to be dog friendly and reliable, sadly the interior center console is not dog friendly...within ten seconds of my dogs checking out the new rig it was destroyed.... My gas cover sticks and I have to ask for strangers to pull the lever while I pry it open with a butter knife ( had it to dealer six times to fix) and the engine burns so much extra oil we have had to undergo annoying oil consumption tests for three thousand miles. The air conditioner runs so loudly you can't hear the radio and the built in radio loses its set stations on a weekly basis!!! I bought this truck at full price brand new..under warranty ..but other then doing free oil consumption tests and bending the spring in my gas cover the warranty does not cover much. The reason I ranked my Subaru so low overall is that i am now in a battle with corporate over my paint job which has been months of trips to multiple dealers and pictures and hours on the phone to be told that my truck with less then 30k miles that sits in my garage has had its paint eaten off by acid rain... Mind you the two other vehicles that are in our driveway are fine... As are all my neighbors and friends... And I have not taken the car out of state.... And the one spot in the car with perfect paint....a door we had replaced by a local body shop after a hit and run when the car was two months old....strange that that paint is unaffected.... Subaru does not back the paint... And the paint warranty oddly enough does not cover any environmental issues... So I am stuck with a forester that has paint missing from top to bottom, front to back down to the base metal...and its practically a brand new truck... So sad and disappointed.... Will never buy a Subaru again....",neg
"This car has the worst driver seat I ever sat in. After 10 miles, I was in a lot of pain-- not just discomfort. It is like sitting on a slab of stone it's so hard. Cusions don't work because of the pitch of the seat. I am seriously thinking of taking the $$ hit and selling after 1 week. I look for reasons to avoid driving. I would not recommend this car. I'm going to the dealer to day to see what they can do for me.",neg
"I took delivery of a 2015 Forester as my company fleet vehicle 3 months ago.
18,000 miles later I remain unimpressed.
Where to begin? The seats. This car is a base model with manual seats. A park bench is more comfortable and probably more supportive. I have driven my Chevy Silverado for 10 hours straight with no issue, but now I have to stop and walk around every two hours.
The power? It sort of seems like it there might be some in there somewhere, but it's never around when you want it. Floor it to scoot across an intersection and torque management comes on so hard you can take a nap while it decides whether or not to move.
Four wheel drive is unpredictable, shifting torque around seemingly at random. Once it sent so mush torque to the front that the steering effectively locked due to torque steer.
In snow it slips, skids, and fishtails all over the place. It took every bit of 4x4 traction control just to get up my driveway (wife's 2014 Mazda 6 with summer tires had no trouble).
But best of all is the heat...or lack of it. It was 25 today. With the grill completely blocked by duck tape, it never got above 190^. I drove all day with the temp turned all the way up, wearing long underwear and 3 shirts and never broke a sweat. Hopefully the company will let me switch to a minivan before it gets below zero!",neg
"Their 3rd row is horrible, no led on XLE 2017, 38000 usd car should have LED light, their 3rd row seat s not same quality as middle row, its not fair. Toyota just taking big money to selling this car but they didn't put nothing in that as value 38000 usd.",neg
"I traded in my 2015 Highlander, which I loved, for a 2018., which I hate.  The most herky jerky (best way to describe) transmission. It's up and down, up and down at lower speeds.  Dealer service manager says its trying to find the right gear.  I put 30k miles on a car a year. I'm at 6k. I might not make 7k and get rid of it.",neg
Noise in rear end.  It sounds like a rubbing noise when braking slowly to a stop.  Very annoying and it is loud at times and other times it does not make a noise.  Have taken to dealer twice.  Road noise is more than expected with this price vehicle.  Dealership is not very supportive in resolving the issue.  Navigation and radio system requires a long reach and is dangerous to operate when driving because it requires too much time and concentration.   Maps are not near as good as the Garmin  GPS system.  Car cuts engine off at each stop light.  To discount this feature it has to be turned off each time the car is started.  Have had some issues with electric tail gate not functioning properly.  Backseat has less room than other competitors SUV’s.  Adults would be very uncomfortable using them.  Dealership doesn’t  seem to be interested in supporting customer.  Don’t know if this is a Toyota organization trait or the individual dealership but usually the dealership minors the company policies.,neg
First new toyota I've owned and didn't live to my expectations.  Engine has tapping noise since first day. Rattling noise coming from rear right corner like if something is loose.,neg
"I have had this car for less than 2 months and I want to get rid of it already.  I paid Toyota to install a DVD player and it doesn't work. We have taken it back twice and they still can't figure out why the sound keeps cutting in and out. I was driving around the other day and the entire ceiling light with Sunglasses holder fell down and smacked me in the face! I've had my brand new 2017 for less than 2 months and it's been in the shop 3 times!!!!  I called Toyota 3 times about the light and they promised to call me back in 5 minutes, it's been 1 week and still no call back. They only care about selling the car, their service department is the worst and they don't call you back (happens every time you call, you just have to keep calling).  I have always heard amazing things about Toyota but after spending over 40,000 on a brand new car and they don't even care enough to call back when things fall out of the ceiling and smack someone in the face why would I ever buy another one let alone keep the one I have? The only time they will actually reach back out to you is when they get a bad review, I am devastated by the treatment we have received thus far. I'm going back to Subaru.",neg
"Car has been in the shop for a new suspension at 5000 miles, replaced the weather seals on windows 6 times due to squeeking, at 15,000 miles the breaks and rotors had to be replaced  and are still squeeking. At 20,000 miles the sunroof spontaneously shattered. Nothing but problems",neg
"there's a batch of 2015 highlanders with a servo which makes an intermittent buzzing. at first you won't really notice because you're loving the new ride, but once you hear it, the sound never goes away. at this point Toyota says the sound is ""normal"", but if you google ""2015 Highlander buzzing sounds"" you'll find a number of message boards with similar experiences. we even purchased the additional warranty on the car, but at this point Toyota and dealerships refuse to admit there's a problem. it's an expensive fix, but they shouldn't have let this batch of cars off the lot with this problem in the first place

When you're test driving, make sure to turn the radio off and keep changing the driver and passenger temperature to see if the buzzing occurs. if it does, run!!!",neg
"Drove  a 2005 Honda Pilot 244,000 miles and loved it every mile. I wanted to buy another Honda Pilot. Do not like the longer, lower to the ground body style. Also a BIG minus is that many safety features (Blind Spot monitoring and others) only available on the top two trims which have a funky 9 speed shift lever. Honda,you need to offer all safety on EXL model. You did away with the EXL Limited trim! 
Do not like having all that glass on the roof of my car (panoramic window). 
New Honda Pilot was a disapointment to me.. I bought from a different manufacturer. 
Troy Doder was a very knowledgeable sales person at Gillman Honda. He knows the Honda products; however the Honda Pilot is not the vehicle I wanted. If I wanted a pick up, Troy knows the Ridgeline. I wanted a Pilot... but not 2018 Pilot.",neg
"The 2017 Touring is our 2nd Pilot and has been a big disappointment. The underpowered engine has a tough time accelerating into traffic and the 9-speed transmission hard-shifts instead of a smooth and seamless shift, jerking passengers in the car around. There is an embarrassing and annoying rattle in the left front that the dealership can’t seem to figure out and another one coming from the steering. I feel like an idiot having paid what I did for this tin can of a car.",neg
"I dont like this car. The seats are uncomfortable especially in this class. The radio is a nightmare to operate(Really Honda, zero buttons!?!?). It is capable of slightly above average performance if you enjoy mashing the throttle and holding it to the floor (Read has zero torque).  For the just below touring model to not have the good headlights is a crime( the running lights fool you into thinking you have HID's, just wait until the first drive in the dark!)
Fuel economy is not impressive. 
I rated value 3 out of 5 because of Honda reliability. Actual value for the money (based on enjoyment of said vehicle, 1 out of 5) I cant believe something that costs this much is so lacking in comfort and convenience. 
I know that Ford and dodge have to distract you with gadgets to get you into their cars, but my 2013 Flex (ecoboost!)had a much better driver/passenger experience. Its just a shame Ford and Dodge allow giant corporate style monopolies to run their dealerships as I would be pleased to drive their offerings. Thankfully the Honda dealership experience has been great so far.",neg
"I sold my Ford Edge and bought a Pilot. I’ve heard how great Honda is, etc. I literally cried the first day I drive the Pilot to work. Horrible ride compared to my Edge. The controls are substandard, the touch screen is not close to driver, it has no pick up, and handles horribly. I took advice from people who only drive Hondas. Well if you only drive one type of car how do you really know if it’s the best. What are you comparing it too?  In all honesty, my Edge blew this Pilot away. If I could return this vehicle I would. The best word to describe it is BASIC.  Ford Sync is light years ahead of Honda. All the controls can be changed using your steering wheel, never have to take your hands or eyes off the road. There is no upgrade$$ for Ford Sync. What was standard options on the Edge can only be gotten with the Touring version of the Pilot. Never ever again will I forgo back up sensors, lane change alert, navigation etc for a substandard vehicle that is ultra expensive for what you get.  Forgeign cars aren’t better. I can say it because I’ve owned both. Disappointed to say the least. Never again. First Honda and it will be my last.",neg
"I hate it. Second Pilot but drives like a car and bogs down on fast acceleration. Tilt wheel gone, Aux port gone, cd player gone. less storage and  cargo area height smaller.  Couldn't camp without  waking the dead with loud beeping of rear hatch that cannot be disabled.  The target demographic is confusing with contradiction of features or lack of.",neg
"The windshield area needs to be enlarged for better viewing.  For a tall person (6' to 6'4"") it is difficult when getting in the car due to the slope of the door as you have to bend down to keep from hitting your head on the frame.  The seating is fairly comfortable but the info system is not easy to operate.  The back of the car should be squared and not tapered as there is not a lot of space to look out the window of the back door.  Engine runs fairly smooth and overall good to handle.",neg
"It is very disappointing.  Does not handle like my other Pilot.  Chassis like a car, steering like a car, beeps like a mini van. Acceleration is horrible and chugs out trying to accelerate into merging traffic. Only 1 charger outlet and 2 usb in the whole car which is much less than my other pilot.  Wish I had never bought it.",neg
"I rated it so low because I purchased this car for its hands-free features and only 4 older model phones work with it other than 6 older model iPhones and Honda has not updated the list since the cars were first built.  So I have a $46,000 car that is really only a basic Pilot.  And there is nothing about it that is hands-free.  Honda was planning to add android auto in this model year and their clueless tech people couldn't figure out how to get lane departure to work with it so they kept Honda link (which they have had issues with if you check online complaints) instead.  I have a Samsung GS7 which is a top selling phone so it makes no sense that it would not be compatible",neg
"I can't seem to get anywhere with customer care so I am going to share my story in hopes of saving others from my misfortune with the newly designed Honda Pilot. I bought a 2016 Honda Pilot last February.  Last week, my air conditioning began to blow warm air.  I took it to a Honda dealership for a diagnostic assessment assuming that whatever was wrong would surely be covered under warranty with a car that is barely a year old.  I get a call stating that they aren't really sure and it may have been that a rock hit my condenser and that is not covered.  The dealership stated  that they see this all the time and it is in ""a vulnerable place at the front of the car.""  I have hit absolutely nothing and have never even heard of such a possibility happening on any other car I have owned.  The fix is $1200 on a basically BRAND NEW CAR.  Please be aware of this design flaw in the new Pilot and purchase something else.  This is the first and last Honda I will ever own as I have been let down and feel as if I have been swindled by the company.  The Economy employee said that the condenser does have a screen which meant the pebble must have been tiny.  So, apparently the tiniest of pebbles can take out an entire air conditioner in a Honda.",neg
Driver seat will not adjust height.  This is a safety issue as I can not see over the dash.  Honda said they did not know how to fix is and I had to wait for a recall -its been 6 months now!  The software constantly glitches when using the iPod.  The windows are sluggish and sometimes will not work at all!  The heater cuts out when stopped but running.  Terrible car!,neg
Og you like the hr style get the 6 speed  DO NOT BUY the 9 speed  transmission.!!!!  Its horrible shifting is unpredictable when you driving. < 35 miles it randomly downshifting then it will rev up to 4000 rpm then the engine is so loud that I have to go to breakdownlane  what I did I have to press the + paddle shifter then press the drive button twice to make the revs go down. I took the car  to yhe dealership they did a software update did not resolve the issue.  I noticed the car  having poor acceleration even with theeco mode is off i have to press harder on gas pedal but then enginewill be loud . This is what Im experincing  after they did the software update. Car shifting is jerky total disappionted with the transmission!!!,neg
"Honk the horn, if you have no problem with the horn (as it is sized for a small moped) then look at what is involved in jump-starting this vehicle. If the procedure for jumpstarting the car isn?t an issue? buy the pilot, as you most likely won?t notice the issues I have noted below. If you take exception to the horn or the need to disassemble the car to jump start it??well the rest of the car like that OPUD (Over promised and under delivered).

I am one who got sucked into the Hype of this vehicle, and I wish I didn?t. My 2016 Honda Elite (?The PIG? the name just fits) has 4,600 miles on it, and it is for sale.

The good. Its size, MPG (even though it has decreased drastically after a software recall), plenty of features.

The Bad. there is mostly good and ugly on this car

The Ugly the 9 speed transmission, auto idle stop ""feature"", the Premium stereo (please listen to this stereo when the car is moving not just when its parked, you will thank me later), voice command is useless. the rear entertainment system is a disaster.

I have 4600 miles on this auto and I just can not sit back and keep reading reviews from folks who say it?s a perfect vehicle. I often question the legitimacy of some of the reviews, like they were written by those with an interest in selling these cars.

The reviews on YouTube, I can only surmise that these guys can?t tell the complete story or they won?t get access to the manufactures cars in the future. Please don?t buy the HYPE.

I had to shorten my review so that it would fit, or I would have given examples. Give this car an extended electronic test drive before buying",neg
"Bought this the week it came out at our local Honda dealership. This was the 3rd Honda Pilot Touring we had owned because we loved the brand. The love quickly faded as all the issues starting screaming at us. First off the 9 speed transmission in the Touring and Elite is horrible. Shifting is inconsistent at low speeds, seems to rev up when when downshifting causing you to quickly react with more pressure on the brake.Very jerky and hardshifts. Does not smoothly drive down isles in parking lots or city driving.
Another issue is the engine seems really loud while idleing, reminds me of an old 1980's American 4cyl with valves tapping, not something you would expect on a $40K vehicle.
I have taken this vehicle into the dealership and it is working perfectly according to them.
Honda did a nice job on the interior and navigation. Fuel mileage is great and highway driving is smooth.
If you like the syle of the new Pilot go with the 6 speed transmission and avoid the Touring and Elite models.",neg
One of the worst models I've ever test drove. I HATE the transmission in the limited model. Styling OK. The driving experience is below average. Disappointing.,neg
The 2016 pilot is almost like a minivan that's not good I own a 2009 pilot and love it it's a truck but this new one is not its a van. I'm not a fan,neg
"I test drove the Crv, not for looks but because I’ve always heard that they’re such great cars. I was NOT impressed, the interior is an eye sore, it just doesn’t flow well, I’m not a big fan the exterior look either. I wasn’t completely disappointed until I actually drove it, it wasn’t a very smooth ride and it did not handle well in comparison to other suvs I’ve test driven. I ended up purchasing a Toyota RAV4 and it’s absolutely wonderful to drive!",neg
"Worst vehicle I have ever owned. There is no end to how crappy this thing is. All ""safety"" features (including the sensing system) except for blind spot warning DO NOT WORK. Touchpad is like a bad DOS program. Sound system blows. Engine needs a cup of coffee and positive affirmations before it will engage. Can't cut a straight line on a freeway without constant micromanaging. Cab is horribly LOUD, especially in the rain. I'm actually embarrassed for Honda if this is the best they can do. I've owned Honda before and had good luck. Even a GM product is better than this cheesy thing.",neg
I have only had this car a few days but I love it.  It is comfortable and stylish.  The more I learn and set up to my liking the more I will love it I am sure.  It has all the bells and whistles.  I bought the touring package.,neg
"We made an appointment to pick up our new 2018 CR-V EX from the dealer. After waiting 5 hours, we were told to go home and come back the next day and it would be ready. They provided us with a free loaner, the 2017 Pilot. We slipped into the seats to head home and they felt goooood!  The only adjustment I had to make was to reach the pedals.  The acceleration was strong and the shifts smooth. It was a pleasure to drive. The next day I picked up the CR-V and spent most of my time on the way home trying to find a comfortable adjustment for the seat. It is small and hard with pronounced bolsters. Since this is Honda's best selling car with a lot of favorable reviews, I'm surprised by the uncomfortable seats. The short cushion feels like it is cutting off the circulation in my right leg. The steering wheel in the Pilot must have been padded or wrapped in leather. It felt comfortable to grip. The CR-V's is hard plastic and becomes uncomfortable after driving for awhile. The rear seats can't be adjusted, unlike other cars. The center console in the Pilot is low and flat so the front seating feels open and unconfined. It also provides a good place to plunk down a pocketbook. The CR-V console is split level and interferes when buckling up and leaves inadequate space for the pocketbook. There are no pockets or drawers in the dash, other than the glovebox, and everything must be thrown into the center console. When accelerating, there is a slight hesitation to start, and the shifts... well, it is a CVT transmission. The engine has a small engine growl when pressed. The Pilot is larger and more expensive, but it might be worth the investment for such a pleasant driving experience.",neg
Engine noise very high when accelerating. Sound varies with outside temperature. Wind noise on drivers side. Sounds like window is partially open. I regret not buying the Toyota.,neg
"WHEN MY OTHER CAR DIED, IT WAS 12 YEARS OLD, I DID A LOT OF RESEARCH ABOUT WHAT KIND OF CAR TO GET.   OUR DAUGHTER HAD A  HONDA AND IS HAPPY WITH HERS , SO AFTER LOOKING AT OTHER CARS,  ZEROED IN ON THE HONDA AND TEST DROVE IT AND LIKED IT AND THE WAY IT HANDLED.... ALSO LIKED THE DEALER  & SALES-WOMEN THAT WE DEALT WITH.  WE FEEL WE GOT A FAIR PRICE AND EVEN GOT THE COLOR THAT I WANTED, PEARL WHITE !!",neg
forget about it I did not like it at all. to top heavy and I tried it on the snow and it didn't do much of anything,neg
This car does not compare to the 2015 model I traded in for the telephone is poor reception and the radio is unclear,neg
"Car itself drives and handles well, electronic problems have not been fixed as of yet, dropped car off at dealer again this morning",neg
"Wonderful, well built car.  Easy to drive and operate.  Ample truck space, modern electrons.  Sleek design that makes you proud to own one.",neg
"Not as good as advertised. Too pricey for the value. Decided to buy Toyota RAV4.  Everyone at the dealer was rude, but Toyota seemed to have better customer service and took my business seriously.  I will not buy another Honda ever again.",neg
"I bought the 2016 Honda CRV and absolutely HATE it. The seat is so uncomfortable, I am sitting on a bar -- minimum stuffing in seats. After 30 minutes, my legs ache from the cramped space.
Tried to do a U-Turn on the highway and the pickup of the vehicle was non-existent. Very weak.
Do not buy this vehicle.",neg
"I  purchased the 2016 crv exl brand new in June 2016, before it was time for an oil change the tool light came on it was even 3 months or had 3000 miles yet, took it to the service center they reset it, soon after I keap feeling the car vibrate when I come to a stop, I  would have to put it in N or P to stop the vibration, I also notice when I drive for a period of time the vibration gets worse, ive taken it back to the service center 3 times before they realised what I  was complaining about, they keep telling me the vibration is normal, also the noise from the engine is  very loud and annoying  they keep telling me that's normal also, I am very disappointed with my purchase, I wanted a  brand new car and I feel like I brought an old used car. Honda told me if  they get complaints about the same problem from other drivers then they will look into it, so basically I'm stuck with a noisy vibrator until other people have problems, witch means by the time they figure out what to  do, my car will have deprecated in value and my mileage will be up, Thanks Honda for leaving a bad taste in my mouth I will never purchase a brand new car again.",neg
"Before we bought the 2016 CR V we read many reviews, most where good. I remember reading one of someone complaining that the vibrations of the suv were causing back pain. I rolled my eyes and said I don't believe that. Well we went on to buy the CR V. After only a few days I notice that my back was hurting a little while after driving it, I figured i just did something to it. Then my husband started complaining that his was also hurting after driving it. We only kept the vehicle for 4 months! It is the worst vehicle we have ever had. Not only was it causing back problems but it was very noisy to drive, the interior was far from nice and we had the touring edition, and it was already starting to drive funny at 7000 miles. I will never again go back to Honda of any kind. Please save yourself the backache, literally, and look for something else. We instead bought the 2017 Acadia and it amazing!",neg
"Horrible...20,000 miles. The battery has died. It shakes in idle and I already have to replace the tires.  I never had these problems with other cars. I have been to the Honda dealer three times and they want to replace with a compact. I bought an awful. DONT BUY",neg
Technically everything works but there are a lot of design flaws that you wouldn't notice until you have the vehicle for a few weeks.  Problems using phone. It doesn't recognize voice 70% of time.  Heat on the feet is positioned weird.  Warms up your ankles instead. Can't make a call while right turn signal is on because of right side camera. Lever to adjust driver seat is in bad spot and gets bumped every time I exit vehicle.  Volume control for radio is a small and weird location on left side of display. Radio display never appears when I turn on vehicle. Always defaults to setting display.  Still think there is a vibration when vehicle idles at stop signs.   Wish I never bought it!!,neg
"Recall the 2015 for the vibration That causes the car, when stopped to vibrate straight up from the brake, to the steering wheel. The vibration hurts your leg and you have to take your hands off the steering wheel, because the vibration is so strong. Recall these cars and fix the problem. There are too many peopl driving these cars and a law suit is in the making by a number of different law firms.",neg
"I bought a Honda CR-V 2015 and was beyond excited. It was the car of my dreams. I had test driven it and everything was fine. It was when the car had warmed up I, and my passengers, noticed a problem. The vibration was very noticeable in all seats of the vehicle. My rear-view mirror and sun visor was shaking. It only happened when I was idling at lights. As soon as I changed gears, it was gone. 
In the end, I returned it. I love Hondas but this problem needs to be fixed. I know some CR-V's are fine but please test drive for a longer time and ask about this problem before purchasing.",neg
"I bought two brand-new 2015 CRV's.

The transmission and NEW technology is horrible. Nothing but problems. At 45 mph there's a slight search like it's going in and out of gear.  Honda corporate was very disappointing. They  were very rude  to the point of harassment 

I have had five Honda is in the past and not sure I'd buy another one.

 I even had the service tech admit to the problem and told me to additional Hondas had come in  with the same problem  while mine was there. 

Do not buy a Honda

Cannot drive it more than 50 miles from home reliably",neg
"2015 CR-V has vibration problems , manufacturer already knows and they no solution for it. this car also has a terrible gas mileage, I drove 190 miles half city and half highway and I put 11 gallon of gas",neg
"DO NOT BUY THIS CAR until you research ""2015 CRV vibration problem"". When you are in drive and stopped in traffic or at a stoplight, the seats vibrate so badly it is disturbing. Honda is aware of this but has done nothing to fix it. If you still want one, make sure you test drive it until it warms up. The rpms idle too low, thus the vibration. Dealers won't tell you about this. """,neg
Leased a 2015 crv and was pretty confident I would love it as I had previously leased 2 crv's. I can tell you this car is a nightmare . Within 2 weeks of driving the vibration at idle started . It seems to be getting worse and I cannot stand driving this car . If you are reading these reviews PLEASE do what I did not do and listen to people that are driving crv's... The vibration problem is real and makes this car awful to drive . With all the amazing suv options out there DO NOT spend your hard earned money on a 2015 crv .,neg
"I do not own this car but I did take it for a test drive and when I saw all the issues of the vibration I decided to look further into it. The dealership told me not to let the ""fake reviews on-line sway me because they are written by other competing dealerships"" FALSE! There are true issues and I called Honda corporate to find out there are and this is copied and pasted from their website:

When driving my 2015 CR-V, I sometimes experience a vibration primarily felt through the driver's seat, either at idle while in gear or while driving at engine speeds below 2,200 RPM. Is this normal?
The 2015 CR-V now includes a Direct-Injection Earth Dreams engine and a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). With the combination, Honda was able to enhance fuel efficiency and increase engine torque. With these changes, some customers have reported experiencing a vibration that they primarily feel through the vehicles driver seat. Customers who experience the vibration have reported it may happen intermittently, either while stopped with the vehicle in gear or while driving at engine speeds below 2,200 RPM. Honda wants to assure our owners that we have heard your concerns and are analyzing available data and customer comments, and performing actual vehicle testing.
Please click here for a descriptive video.

I don't think I'm interested and they said nothing has been done for these owners, other than documenting their VIN's and they will look into it. Also, from my own observations the cloth fabric on the front seats are not tucked under and the edges all show which is unsightly. The dealerships don't want to address or hear about these complaints and want to move on to the next customer.",neg
"When testing this car take it for a longer drive. When car is warming up it drives with higher RPM so driving experience is good. When is completely warmed, the computer starts optimizing RPM for full efficiency. It lowers the RPM to the point that everything vibrates. You will experience vibration when car is stopped and idling. RPM will go down below 600 and the car starts shaking. After 6 months asking and waiting for the fix Honda changed transmission mounting to reduce the vibration when idling. To my disappointment vibration was reduced only a bit. The shuddering when accelerating is very strong - driving experience is horrible. I really hope Honda will address these issues. I tested other brand SUVs and I liked them. I went with Honda because of my previous experience with Honda Accord 2003 which was excellent. I will never trust the brand again.",neg
"We bought Honda crv LX aug 31st, 2015. Only 156 miles, after stopping for single light experience terrible vibration, engine RPM goes all over. Check engine light banking. Car could not accelerate above 25 mi/h. I had to drive few miles and got in to parking lot , stop the car wait few minutes and start again. Check engine light is gone and car stated to work fine. I am going to dealer tomorrow. Do not buy this car.",neg
"I recently bought a Honda CR-V EX-L W/Navigation. I did test drive a CR-V and it was ok but, I changed my mind for another color and bought a same car with different color assuming both performs the same. Honda CR-V has a serious problem of VIBRATION. When the car drives at some particular speed (like 20-30 and 50-60 mph) or if the vehicle is stopped at a signal or a stop sign, the car vibrates like anything. HONDA KNOW THIS ISSUE but selling cars without fixing the issue. When I noticed the problem just after a couple of days and took my car to the dealer, they said "" THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE. HONDA KNOW THIS PROBLEM. WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING AS THIS HAS NO FIX YET. WE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE TO FIX THIS ISSUE. WE WILL LET YOU KNOW ONCE WE HAVE ANY FIX. THIS HAPPENED TO ACCORD 2 YEARS BACK AND FIXED AFTER A WHILE. EXCEPT THIS ISSUE, YOU GOT A NICE CAR"". I don't know what they mean by NICE car if it has a serious problem in the core, and the NICE car they said costs a huge amount. So, please make as many test drives as possible. Don't get disappointed after buying the car. Don't just trust the car by its brand image (as I did). i assume that my warranty period would be completed by the time they got a fix for this and I may have to pay again for the fix. VERY DISAPPOINTED.",neg
"My, like others 2015 CRV's vibrates excessively to the point of nearly stalling when at stop lights. This issue has completely destroyed my ownership experience. And with no fix in sight for what Honda calls a ""Mode 1"" vibration issue, I cannot possibly recommend this vehicle as a purchase. It truly is buyer beware! You may or may not get a CRV which exhibits this vibration problem.",neg
love this car until it starts viberating .makes driving not much fun. honda has known about this for some time but cant do anything about it.this is my first and last honda.,neg

"Bought in March. Now that weather is warming, I find that the A/C is not cooling effectively. Also, as many, many others have noted, the vibrations when in drive at a stop sign/light can cause equilibrium issues and have caused me to suffer from nausea on a couple occasions. Drove a Pilot for 10 years and hoped this car would equal the quality and reliability I experienced with the Pilot; alas, it is not to be. If the dealer from whom I purchased doesn't ""do the right thing,"" I will gladly trade for something else. Fuel savings is great, but no trade-off if I am going to get nauseous each time I drive it.",neg
"I am extremely disappointed with my brand new 2015 CRV EX purchase. Within a week of my purchase I started feeling a strong vibration, when I stopped in traffic and red lights. This angers me so much because it can be annoying. I have had older cars that do not feel this way. I still do not understand who come this vehicle has so many excellent awards, accolades and ratings. Honda must find a solution to this problem soon.",neg
"I just got honda CRV 3/2015
2nd day I found the car shaking, Honda don't know how they fix it, no actions from the dealer, you cannot return it, or get a credit ..........Nothing!
NO DEAL!!!!
I didn't recommended for any !!!",neg
"I just leased a 2015 Honda crv exl. On the second day driving the vehicle I noticed the vehicle would vibrate when in Drive and I am stopped at a red light or stop sign. As soon as I start driving the vibrations disappear, as soon as the vehicle comes to a stop the vibrations start again.

The vibrations vary in strength (it sort of pulses in and out) and sometimes it's so strong that I start to feel sick to the stomach. It's become so bad that at every red light I put the car in neutral and only shift back I to Drive when the light turns green.

I have reached out to the dealer with no results. Their response has been ""This is because of the CVT feature of the engine (?!)

Its obvious that Honda is aware of this but is continuing to sell this vehicle with no disclaimer. I am lucky that it's only a lease. After 36 months I can say goodbye to Honda for good.",neg
"As many have mentioned before, this 2015 CR-V EX-L is also plagued by the vibration issues.

The sales person never mentioned this issue (of course) and I never felt it while test driving the car. I also missed the terrible sounding radio. I didn't care too much about the infotainment interface the, and I abhor it now.

Navigation only works if you have the app + cable and phone Honda wants you to use.

Overall not happy with the purchase. It is starting to deliver on the promise of better fuel consumption but the vibration issues make me wonder about the long term reliability of this vehicle.

I would encourage others who are shopping for this vehicle to be forward and ask the sales people about the vibration issues and shop elsewhere.

I would return this vehicle in a heartbeat.",neg
"Bought in November. Vibrations in seats and steering wheel at idle and in motion. Very unpleasant and distracting (safety issue?) On April 7, Honda posted a YouTube video about the problem, They are working on a solution. Note the title halfway through: Some vibration is normal. I don't see this in their advertising.",neg
"Love the car when I first test drove it. Unfortunately, not long after I got the car, I started feeling strong vibration when I stopped at stop signs and red lights. Went on the web to to find out what's going on, and found that many owners have reported the same issue. Took it back to the dealership and they pretend that they didn't know about it. Eventually, they called me back and told me Honda has known about the issue and is looking for a fix. Too late for me, can't get me money back.",neg
"Bought a 2015 Honda CR-V to replace my wife's 14 yr. old car. They both ride about the same but unlike the old car ( not a Honda) the CR-V has numerous problems at just over 1,000 miles. The problems include vibrations at idle and low speed driving up to 60 mph and also on deceleration. The dealership initially acted as though it was something uncommon among this model and even stated the CR-V Is not a luxury car, but merely a runabout or errand car and you'll have some vibration. They eventually admitted there is a problem and no current fix.

The rear brakes were making noise and the rotors were scored. The dealer decided to save some money by machining the rotors instead of replacing them with new ones. The Service Advisor claimed they machine new rotors out of the box and they are somehow better than new. They also claimed to have replaced the rear pads.

Honda Hands Free Link reminds me of an old video game. Cheap, low rent graphics and of course, our phones aren't compatible. Honda would have you buying a phone from one of their preferred associates and this will add to operating costs and is also something we don't want or need.",neg
"Don't bother until a fix is found for the vibration issues on the 2015 CRV. I am extremely disappointed that my brand new vehicle shakes so much while idling. It also shudders/vibrates somewhat between approximately 15-50mph. My family all owns Honda vehicles and we love them, until this one. Surely Honda can do better than this!!!",neg
"I, like many others, have major issues with vibrations (mostly at idle). I was told by my dealership that I ""was the only one"" that complained of this. However, I went online and see it is indeed a problem with the 2015s in general, not my vehicle. I hope Honda does a recall soon to fix this or I will never buy a Honda again (and neither will my family and friends who experienced the vibrations in my car). In addition, I drive the highway and accelerate slowly with the eco button on, and can't get above 25.7 mpg on the highway.",neg
"Like the car but the vibrating when in drive is horrible.
Apparently they are working on it and who know when that will be. Will not buy Honda again if it runs like this.",neg
TERRIBLE VIBRATION. Honda reps don't care. Open a case w Honda. It's under investigation. Nobody can answer how long it gonna be.,neg
"I would not recommend purchasing this vehicle.

Let me first state this is my third Honda in 25 years. My previous two were well engineered and reliable. To friends and co-workers I always recommended a Honda. But there is something wrong with this model.

Please note I'm not one of those customers to raise holy heck if I find a ""hair out of place"" realizing a car is a very intricate piece of machinery.

As mentioned in the other comments there is excessive vibration in the steering column and into the seat. Both while idling and driving at any speed. It's just plain annoying. I contacted the dealer and their statement is ""we are NOT seeing this problem with other customers"" . That's their line. I recently met a Honda engineer and he stated Honda is working on the problem but can't find a solution.

I know there are always quirks with a car but this is excessive. Additionally, the power outlet to run my GPS doesn't work and now my back brakes
are ""rubbing"". I'm a fairly conservative driver and drive probably 85%+ on the highway. I'm lucky to get 27MPG (AWD-LX). This car is rated 26-33.
It just seems like a non-Honda product. The heater is weak. The radio sounds like a clock radio. The electronic gas usage screen read out. It bounces
all over the place. I have 300 miles left. Ten miles down the road I have 225 miles left. Then back up to 280?

Positives are this CVT transmission is quick. You get the power to jump out when to you need it. We had 7 inches of snow recently and I got around with no problems.

My big mistake is not taking this car out for an extended drive. I was looking at the 2014 models and was leaning toward a purchase after numerous test drives but backed off when I decided to
keep my car through one more winter. It broke down and I bought the 2015 model after a 15 min test drive thinking it was similar to earlier models. I would recommend to anyone to see if you could test drive a car for a half day or more to really get the feel of it before you buy.",neg
"Agree with the review here that indicate shuddering/vibration at various speeds and RPMS. Just bought 2015, took back to dealer and service manager said this was normal! I have never had a new vehicle that does this and I would not buy another Honda if they don't fix this.",neg
"I have been a life long Honda fan and often bragged about how ""bulletproof"" the brand is. We purchased the new 2015 CRV-LX and I can say without an near equal this is the worst vehicle I've owned. It shakes and shudders and idle, the vibrations become maddening at higher speeds and engine races while switches gears with the RPM's jumping all over the place. It also takes forever to heat up and the power steering is so sensitive it constantly feelsike its out of alignment. So disappointed in Honda. I have 2004 Element with 160,000 miles on it and it feels like a Maybach compared to this new CRV. Called to complain and basically got the blow off. Unless Honda does something drastic they have certainly lost a customer for life in me and my family.",neg

I never turn it off due to being too hot. At home I keep my heat at 62 at home, so you would think 77 in my car would be too hot. With all my previous cars I NEVER WOULD PUT THE HEAT AT 77 and keep it there due to not being warm enough.",neg
"I'm a fan of CR-V But this is not for anyone
This car is full of errors
Vibrates at every traffic light
It's totally noisy. what is it with Honda??",neg
"Have exactly same vibration problem like other guy . The brand new car 2015 CVR vibrate when idle, stop at the traffic light. The vibration problem get worse when driving alone (light load) and frequent stop at the traffic light. When running or on highway it works great but when idle, it shakes like a 10 years old used car.",neg
"I bought Honda CRV 2015 EX-L and having Vibration issue from day one. My brother bought same day and all the Honda CRV 2015 has same issue. I am very unhappy with whole new car experience as vibrations at stop light are very noticeable even in the back seat (My 9 daughter said ""my butt is shaking!') I would not buy Honda CRV until this fixed. My fear is that this may not be fixable issue!!:(",neg
"I didn't care for the car because it felt like a toy and not a rugged vehicle as assumed, it seemed as if it was made of plastic and I felt every bump in the road.",neg
I hate this car.  It has no security features and tons of blind spots on the base model.  I was duped into buying this car and it is very cheaply made.  I will just let them repo it because I'm not paying for this hunk of junk.,neg
"I don't recommend the dealership"" Jacksonville Chrysler Jeep Dodge Ram Arlington"", they scammed me and sold me a dented new jeep car that has issues....",neg
Many transmission problems. Returned six times still not right. Owned six months and in shop more than I have,neg
Only 3k miles and the PTU needs to be replaced been in shop 6 days. Apparently transmission has to be re- learned when this happens. Not a good feeling!,neg
"Bought and sold 5 weeks later with 1000 miles. Could not get use to the extremely underpowered and unresponsive drive. the complex 9 sp trans bogs down the 1.4 L engine, not a good marriage. The JEEP Cherokee 4x2 was boring, slow, doggish and loves the 1200 - 1700 rpm range. FIAT will ruin JEEP! Do not buy this vehicle, its slower than a moped. Plus, 30 MPG Hwy....my butt...27 avg.",neg
"Excellent  on snowy roads, dry shaft broke at 10,000 miles , unlock nav  300 dollars, did not come with a trunk cover, very sluggish, when set cruise control speed would bounce from 64 to 65 , has good storage inside, you have to push a button for the gas cover (from the inside that was a pain)",neg
"The jeep cherokee with the 2.4 multi air flow engine uses oil. My 2016 jeep had 12,500 miles on it when i sold it . During that time i have put it 6 quarts of oil in it.I delt with Chrysler Corp. Resolution dept. To try to deal with this problem . We did a oil consumption test and it fell into to manufacture specs. Manufacture spec are 1 quart every 2000 miles. The Chrysler Corp. And the dealership don't tell you this when you go to buy the car. When i spoke to the Service Manager at the dealership where i bought it he told me that it was a common problem with the 2.4 engine and it has been going on since 2012 . It has been a known problem but Chrysler still sell this product to the consumer . I will never buy a Chrysler product agian.",neg
"This vehicle is  nice looking but has some issues, the vehicle stop/start is annoying, you can't turn off radio, you can only mute or turn down, it still comes on every time you start the vehicle. The Uconnect app is a joke it hardly ever works in the vehicle, says app error all the time. Sharp looking but not practical.",neg
"The car on paper is such a good value V-6, panaromic sunroof, leather seats, nav, heated seats all under 32k. 

We enjoyed it for 4 weeks before issues started surfacing. Car doesn't start when hot is most critical one, Chrysler is giving runaround and avoiding fixing the issue ( they know they messed up badly with wiring and electronics). Now we are stuck with the car that does not work and is unsafe and having to put up horrible customer service from Chrysler LLC.",neg
"They have placed the air intake at the bottom of the motor. I purchased for reliability in all weather, was assured this is it. 
Around the block from my house wave of water came rushing down hill, sucked water up and seized up the motor. This is a design issue that they will ""fix"" with a snorkle kit. Too late. Should have told me. 
My 92 Mazda and 06 Nissan have dealt with deeper water than this. Very dissappointed. I will assume it is an ""extra accessory"" but was never suggested.",neg
i have 2016 jeep cherokee its 8200miles now i heard noise on engine like sound of rotor of helicopter bring to the dealer west sahara chapman in las vegas nv. bring it 7 times now they said still normal that annoying noise. does i bought new car supposed to be its quiet not noisy . i call chrysler customer service they dont care only said they call me but they dont called i already called 200 times nothing. so dont buy jeep cherokee they give you headache.,neg
Already had to replace water pump and now transmission is out. Thank god it is under warrenty. Just sucks as my husbans travels for work and it broke down over 2 hours from home.,neg
Bought my car in may and it already needs a new part.  I was now told it will end up being over a month and a half until it's fixed. My remote start doesn't work due to the check engine light being on.  I lease this vehicle and half to make a payment on something that is technically broken and not working right. Was told to suck it up and there's nothing they can do about it.,neg
"I am a long time/+30 year jeep owner, have owned just about every version type of Jeep & when the Cherokee was brought back, I was excited, then seeing it on the road the 1st time, I couldn't wait to test drive it, so rented it for a week. 1st the good; it looks great, the front seats are some of the most comfortable I have ever sat in a car, up there with our Mercedes. It has a lot of space inside. Now the bad; the transmission on this thing is the worst I have ever driven, 9 gears, with a gate shifter, I couldn't wait to play with it, it takes over a second for it to shift in each gear, huge disappointment. The shifter is designed so you can't put your whole hand around the shifter, due to the closeness of the center armrest to the shifter, when I shifted I had to hold my hand in an awkward & uncomfortable u-shape, Jeep/Dodge engineers really?. The dash looks like it is from a 1987 Lebaron, with the strip light indicators for all of the gauges. The steering controls are terrible, just the Cruise control controls on the right take up no less then 5sq inches of space. There was no volume control on the steering wheel, the most commonly used button. Maybe just our trim level, but the stereo is the worst stereo I have ever heard in a new car, we had to turn the bass all the way down so the dash didn't rattle, which reminds me the dash rattles regularly. It has the turning radius is horrible. The cargo space in the rear is the worst I have seen, was excited to see the cargo departments under the main cargo floor above the tire, but you can only fit a soda can width items in there, the cargo floor is not hinged, if you want to pull something out of the bottom cargo space you have to remove everything from the rear cargo floor, which would be great on long road trips to pull everything out. There is a weird, metal bracket thing on the left, that looks like there was a lot of thought into it/engineering, but you pull its handle & it just falls down as it is heavy & serves no purpose. The engine in our trim level has little power even in sport mode. This is a poorly thought out vehicle, wish the designers, engineers, ceo's would take 1 drive in an Audi, even a Ford or a Kia to understand how well thought/worked out those cars are. My wife didn't like it as well, we ended up buying a Kia instead of the Cherokee & it is in a completely different/higher league than the Cherokee. Very disappointed in Jeep.",neg
"I asked for a new lease price on a Jeep..I am currently leasing A Chrysler Town and Country for $330 per month which expires in May 2016...I was quoted a lease price on the Jeep for over $380 per month...that's not a good deal. I priced similar models to the Jeep, a Kia Sportage, Honda CR-V and a Hyundai and the lease on those comparable vehicles was between $250 and $280 per month.....why the difference ????????No argument with the agent, he was respectful...never blame the messenger.",neg
"Bought a 2106 TH on 10-13-15 and it went in for ""service"" to resolve a rear seat rattle on 10-15. It has been in for service 4 times since then, including a 6 day stay in the shop. After performing the repair from a recommended service bulletin, the rear seat still rattles constantly. Dealership can replicate the rattle, but they just can't seem to fix it. Chrysler opened a star case, but no resolution. Disappointing.",neg
"I just discovered that there is absolutely no way to start my grand Cherokee with out the key fob. So if I am a thousand miles from home, stop at a gas station, turn off my car and the battery gives out on my key fob: I am stuck until I can find a replacement battery ever try to do that in the great open spaces of Montana??",neg
Enjoyed driving this vehicle.  Had quite a few issues over the years.  Had a chance to trade it in on a new one and chose to pass.  Don't see myself in another vehicle like this one in the future.,neg
"There are too many weak components to this vehicle despite its popularity in the marketplace. The transmission is the most frustrating as it shifts into a higher gear after turning a corner instead of downshifting. The body design ""catches"" weeds and debris if you go off road even a little bit. The gas latch frequently freezes shut in the winter months.",neg
"We were in the market for a new car but on a budget. After looking at several smaller SUV we came across the 2015 Jeep. I was not to keen on the style and it had not grown on me. 
The price was the eye catcher with plenty of cargo room. The bad:  the power train is ridiculous, you have to floor it to climb a small hill. The passenger seat feels like someone is poking you, the center consol has been repaired 3 times from becoming loose and now if we were to sell or trade we are looking at a 10000 drop in value.",neg
"I bought it a month ago. But then I saw that he was not what I liked. Because his engine is weak for such a big car.
 And my model is without any functions. So it is not so convenient. But overall it's a fine vehicle",neg
Purchased new. Had to have transmission replaced at 18k miles. This was covered under warranty. I am constantly bringing this car in for recalls and software updates. Led headlights have to be replaced by a dealer at 500 for bulb with labor.,neg
"Why would they make a seat like this? I'm 5'10"" and the seat length is too short-it digs into my mid-thighs. I've owned over 10 cars and never had this problem! No matter how I adjust it, it is extremely uncomfortable. I'm devastated. I owned a Jeep before-why would I think I had to worry that the seat was uncomfortable when they have been making them for decades? I am livid. I can't travel or go on any trips.",neg
"Purchased it brand new in Sept 2015 , one year into it  ( 22k miles) developments a shifting problem  Made a clunking sound when it shifted from 4th to 5th plus lower gears were a bit sluggish. Had it in the shop 4 times , the last time a Jeep Tech looked at it, claimed he could not find anything wrong, however the noise happened about 10 times since he looked at it. There is numerous reviews on the internet about other people having the same problem. The 9 speed tranny is junk, had to trade it in and take a big hit Hate the car",neg
This was the worse buy ever! I love the look of the vehicle but it drives extremely rough  and accelerates on its own. I have now only 15000 miles on it and it feels like it need a new transmission after it was already just replaced in October with only 11000 miles on it. I've been sold a lemon! Do not buy this car!,neg
"I have had my car now for 2 years and it has just shut off on me more than 6 times while driving including in he interstate. Definetly scary situation and terrified to get back in the car meanwhile they keep ""fixing"" it and the Jeep is not really giving my options. A customer's safety should always come first so mad and upset about the whole situation.",neg
Quick update from last weeks review. I mentioned the Engline light came on the very next day after having several software updates. Dealer says it now needs a NEW TRANSMISSION after light comes again! 3500 miles and you need a new transmission is alarming to say the least. I don't believe Jeep has done their home work on the 9 speed transmission/software to properly have a smooth running vehicle. Many others have had this same issue. Luckily for us the vehicle kept running and we weren't stranded somewhere on the highway on a vacation.,neg
"As someone who goes to car dealerships often and talks to the service workers, I would NOT recommend this car. Often, the transmission gets blown on it rather quickly, and makes it an expensive fix. When my family test drove one, it was comfortable to ride in. But other than that, its not worth the high price tag they put on it. And for one of the higher (more loaded) ones, its basically the price of the Grand Cherokee, which that would be better to go for than this.",neg
"Bought new 2015.

Made it to 1300 miles and shifting issues arose.

Hauled to local dealer by Jeep.

Told the transmission needs to be replaced. After several days, transmission is replaced and is returned as repaired.

Notice vibration and call Jeep.

Told the axles need to be replaced. Also told said axles are not available until September sometime.

Transmission is beginning to exhibit same issues as was first reported. It's only been 200 miles to start having problems again.

Totally disgusted with the whole situation with this vehicle.",neg
It needs a new transmission! The new transmission finally arrived at the dealer two weeks later as of today. Now it will be another two weeks before it is installed because the dealer has only one mechanic that does transmissions. Totally not acceptable.,neg
"I am upset about this car. This is my first brand new car. I loved it when I got it. But only after one month, only 2000 miles, the engine light is on. I was told transmission has some issue. Now I am driving a loaner car. Can't believe this. I regret that I choose this car because I can't count on its reliability.",neg
Coming from a full size SUV to the Cherokee was a big mistake. Too much like a car than a SUV. Price points kept me from going to the Grand Cherokee but that was a mistake. You get what you pay for. Wish it was a 24 month lease instead of a 36 month.,neg
"Bring back the old Cherokee with no electronics or backup cameras or driver assist etc, if you cant handle a car you shouldn't be on the road to begin with.

we just want a basic off road machine with many options for modification unlike new cars with wheel wells that touch the ground.

the only off road jeep that is capable of anything off road is the wrangler. this is a commuter plain and simple with off road capabilities simply added to make you think you can do extreme off roading through a creekbed lol",neg
"I traded my 2013 grandcherokee 20000 miles for the cherokee. I regret every moment I get into it. I hit my head everytime. There is no space to put anything. I lost a lot of trunk space also. The nav is great. It rides like a truck, I'm sure its the tires. The only thing I gained with the cherokee was the auto tailgate. The passenger sit isn't even power. For trailhawk and the money its not worth it. I am desperately trying to work something out to get a grand cherokee. I jumped the gun to soon because I was having quite some trouble with the radio, nav, bluetooth, etc. They were playing guessing games with it, replaced the radio with a new one twice, softw",neg
"Test drove one due to the name. Hoped for the best, but had to use my '86 XJ to pull it out of a dirt driveway. Nuff said. Rides nice, and all the modes indicate it was designed for trails, but when it fails to negotiate a muddy road, it's evident the t-case is decorative. This is a mall cruiser, pure and simple.",neg
"One week after purchasing, radio HVAC non responsive, got a call from dealer saying those problems are fixed but they ran into more issues.  Jeep has been in dealer shop now more than we had it.",neg
"We drove GC Summit and vehicle felt cheap and did not drive or handle well. For starters the interior felt very cheap and finish had a lot issues uneven gaps in trim and knobs that felt like cheap plastic. When we drove it was not very responsive. Surprised there people who are willing to drop 50k when Acura, Audi, Lexus, Infinity, Toyota etc all have SuV in that price range that are far better.",neg
"At 1059 miles the vehicle is in for service, the technicians don't know what's wrong and tbe vehicle does not run. The dealer does not have a loaner.",neg
"Two major repairs right after it went out of warranty of course!  One for $1,000 and the other for $2,000. Had to spend hours on the phone with Jeep to try and get some help, very uncooperative and would not stand behind their vehicle.",neg
Leather seats in car shriveled up within month of owning it. Dealership and Chrysler refusing to replace or do anything about it.,neg
"I lease a 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo E 4x4 which I've had for 11 months to the day. I only cross-shopped this vehicle with a Jeep Wrangler Unlimited, and settled on the Grand Cherokee after being truthful with myself about the amount of times I would be able to use the Wrangler to it's full potential. Before leasing the vehicle, I had heard of a few issues with the 2014 Grand Cherokee models, but could not find anything negative about the 2015s and assumed any kinks had been worked out.

I love this car for its exterior and interior styling. I have pretty much a base model car, but it comes with many standard creature comforts like the keyless enter and go, push button start, power seat, automatic dual zone climate control, etc. It also looks like a much more expensive vehicle.

I HATE this car for its cheap build quality and faulty electric systems. As soon as I drove the vehicle off the dealer's lot I noticed that the headlights flicker sometimes when the car is shifting. On several occasions my radio has completely shut off and restarted while I was driving, other times it has just simply shut off and does not reset until I restart the vehicle. I have also had my instrument cluster turn completely black while driving, which includes my speedometer.

Two days after getting home with the car I noticed that my seats were ripped at the seams in the second row and passenger seats where no one had sat before. This is a minor problem, but just an example of the cheap quality workmanship.

Roughly six months after buying the GC, I started hearing sloshing water in the driver's side dashboard. At first I attributed it to heavy rains the night before, but after continuously hearing the water and it progressively getting worse, I brought it to my local dealership. After several weeks of back and forth with them, they took the dashboard apart below the steering wheel and removed a 1/2 gallon of water; however, they were unable to identify the source of the water.

A few days ago, on a cold February morning, I heard a piece of ice slide across the dashboard as I turned corners. The water issue is back and is now freezing! Before being able to make an appointment to have this looked at, my entire climate system: heat, air conditioning, and defroster stopped working altogether today. The fan started blowing at full blast and then suddenly stopped and started to make a knocking noise. It wasn't a fun ride to the dealership on a 28 degree night.

I'm eagerly awaiting the resolution to this most recent instance of my reoccurring problem and will make every attempt in my power to just get rid of this vehicle ASAP. The beautiful aesthetics and interior finishes are not worth the headache and aggravation of being without a car once a month while it sits in the dealership and they scratch their heads looking at it.",neg
"Bought a 2015 jeep grand cherokee injan 2015. March 2015 in the shop liftgate not latching. Less than 2000 miles. April, it would not start. Left us stranded in va. and could not finish/enjoy vacation. Dealer had no clue what the problem was & chrysler wasn't much help. Less than 3300 miles and have lost confidence in the jeep.",neg
"... this post is coming from a former assembly line worker turned electrical engineer for chrsyler ...

1. Fit n Finish - LOOKS great, but a closer eye shows huge misses - tail gate mis-aligned is a big issue.

2. Removed FLIP REAR GLASS on back hatch ... deal breaker for me (others don't care, but i use the UTILITY-ness of that feature every day).

3. No EMBEDDED CROSSBARS ... i have to buy after sales crossbars that look non-integrated? come on jeep ... 50k can't get me an sUv (the U is capital for a reason!)

4. TRANSMISSION ISSUES - no thanks ... this is at least 3 years down-the-road from being ironed out ... i'll let someone else work out these kinks! And please, ONLY purchase the ZF manufactored tranny (V8, Diesel) and not the chrysler sourced ZF one (V6).

5. ELECTRICAL ISSUES - this is probably what scares me the most ... after the 3y36k warranty is up ... a minimum repair bill for electrical (look at all the 2014 posts) is 3k ... THEY REPLACE THE ENTIRE UNITS ... they don't repair anything ... its a total replacement. The same can also be said for the TRANSMISSIONS ... they tried the infamous throttle/body fix ... but in the end, are massively replacing TRANSMISSIONS

6. ENGINE. At least jeep got it somewhat right here ... except for the DIESEL DEF problems (again, google it ... its a pretty big deal and is the reason the 2015 JGC Diesels were held-back until they rectified the problem).

7. GEAR SHIFTER. It was a nice concept, but if you poll all 175,000 2014 JGC owners, i think you'll find they'd prefer the TURN KNOB shifter (or even the legacy shifter) and not the mistake-prone (over shot the selected gear) on the post 2013 JGC's.

8. WARRANTY. I'm normally not a fan of after-market warranties, but if you're hellbent on purchasing any post 2013 JGC, please do get the MAXCARE warranty ... YOU WILL THANK ME WITH FUTURE DOLLARS SAVED!!!",neg
"My wife likes it, I think the steering can be improved, seems to wobble. vehical seems top heavy, sways, seems like it could upset, jerkey turning",pos
"I think it's one of the best cars, especially for where I live. When it was snowing heavily, I didn't have to think twice about getting to work safely. It's very responsive, feels comfortable for long distance driving, and it loves going uphill especially and going over bumps and potholes effortlessly while driving in the city. This is my first Subaru, and I am sold.",pos
The Forester is replacing a Crostrek that we really like.  The extra room is wonderful and the amenities on the Forester are great.  I look forward to keeping and using this car for a long time to come.,pos
"I did my research with Consumer Reports before deciding on the Forester.  It's everything and more of what I wanted.  I chose the Eyesight safety features and it's well worth it, being an aging driver.  Also, no need to lift one's leg so high to get in and out.",pos
Love all it's features including the all wheel drive and how it handles in WI winter weather.  The extra room for traveling is a plus!!,pos
This is my 3rd Subaru - 1 Outback and 2 Foresters.  Very reliable cars.  The style is good and comfortable.  I know I can always depend on these cars from Subaru.,pos
I purchased Subaru Forester 2018 recently and it has been absolutely fantastic ride since. It is a great car with great comfort and style. The inbuilt functions make this car very reliable. Eyesight highly recommended if you are considering to add that feature.,pos
Meets all my needs for my work roomy up front and more than enough storage space. Take off is outstanding handling is quick response.lightning is some of the brightest I have seen.Takes the off road very good ground clearance is good for the average drive off the beaten path,pos
"Great car with great safety features, styling tends more towards functional than pretty, but still a solid design.  With the boxer engine and CVT it is nice an smooth acceleration and nimble in the curves.",pos
I love it. This car is the first purchase I made of a new car in 40 years. I'm very happy with the car and my experience in purchasing it.,pos
"I have found this car to superb in every way. From its features to its style. It is not the most expensive suv out there but it sure has that feel. For mine being the base model it comes with the important standard features all cars need. Rear camera, hands free calling. And more. I am loving this thing",pos
SO FAR I LIKE THE VEHICLE I LIKE THE LEGROOM AND I LIKE THE COMFORT OF THE VEHICLE I REALLY HOPE THAT THE OVERALL WILL TURN OUT POSITIVE,pos
I love it... just wish I could have afforded the power seat package like my other cars..   I have had four back surgeries and believe it or not... it is hard for me to bend and reach the manual lever and adjust the seat,pos
We feel like this is the safest and most comfortable car we have ever owned. Easy to get in and out of and not too small and not too big. Quiet and comfortable ride.,pos
"I had been driving various rental cars so I knew what I wanted. I liked the wide real window, adjustable seats, digital speedometer, radio controls on steering wheel, leather interior, smooth ride.",pos
I'm hoping that all the wonderful features in my Forester will make me a true believer in Subaru like my kids and grandkids for many years.,pos
"I love everything about my new 2018 Subaru Forester! It rides smooth & so quiet. It has every feature I could possibly want. The body style is awesome, & the inside has lots of space. Cars have pulled out in front of me & I am very impressed at how quickly my vehicle applies the brakes. The safety features are remarkable. I will not own any other vehicle but Subaru. It's actually the best present I ever gave to myself. It's just perfect in every way. ...got to love it....",pos
"I only have 350 miles on it it but everything seems good.
Comfortable, economical quiet and all the basic features I need.
It was a top rated small SUV by Consumer Reports.",pos
"I'm a long time buyer of Subaru.This is the fifth car that I have been lucky enough to have  owned. I love the way they handle, look and preform.",pos
"I have a superb vehicle in body style and wind resistance, handling and suspension and durability and traction for snow and climbing and descending on hills.  It gives me a smooth quiet ride.",pos
Doors open nice and wide.  Seating is so comfortable.   Very quiet on the highway.   Gets good gas mileage.  Back end is very spacious and lots of room for storage.,pos
This car runs really well. Has many nice features like lane assist and safety cameras on the front. Plenty of leg room. Really comfortable.  I think I may be a Subaru customer for life,pos
"This is first time I have ever owned a Subaru.  The visibility of the car is great, the panoramic moon roof provides maximum light during a trip, the turn radius is impressive and the mileage is excellent.  The only thing I don't like as well is when the back seats down,  the different height from the cargo to the seat is very uncomfortable for my dog.  He likes to lay close to the front seat.  Overall, it's a great car.",pos
"Daily commute is mixed country roads, some gravel, some freeway and some city. I am consistently averaging above 30 MPG.
Ground clearance excellent.  Handling is secure.  Ride is comfortable and quiet.
Visibility is superb.",pos
"I have to go to my job in any weather. This car provides that possibility without any exceptions.
It is simple and reliable, easy for driving.",pos
"I bought my vehicke from Osteen Subaru in Valdosta and I could not b e more pleased. I love driving my Subaru! I feel safe and it's just a wonderful vehicle. 8 have always wondered about a Subaru. Been looking for my perfect car for a little over a year now. Pulled in to the dealership on a whim, test drive the car and I was hooked after the test drive. Talked it over with my husband and bought it!! Could not be happier. #subifamily #lovemyforester #blackout",pos
"This is my second Forester. I trust the car to the point that I gave my first one to my son who is a new driver. I use it mainly to commute to work, but we generally take the car out instead of our family SUV. The car is affordable to buy as well as own. Great gas mileage and reliability are it's most important virtues. It has plenty of interior room and the fifth door is very convenient for storage.",pos
My wife has a 2016 and it was a lot easyer to get in and out of than my Impreza. That is why I made the Trade. So Far  So Good.,pos
Forest car we could get with a moon roof.  Plenty of leg and head room.  Love the heated seats.   I love the eye sight.  Works great dieting my commute.,pos

Looks better than most performances is the best I have ever driven safety features are the best and rated as such",pos
"Safety features are very good. It is  easy to get in and out of the car. 
Well designed controls. The car handles well on the highway. Good accceleration",pos
"This car met all my needs. Reliable, Stable and the acceleration was surprisingly great.  The only compliant I can see people have for this car is their entertainment system. The loading screen was a bit slow. But I did not purchase this car for the entertainment system.",pos
"I love the power going up steep inclines which is provided by the all wheel drive.  I do not have to push the accelerator down as much as I had to with my Camry which had the same size engine, torque, and transmission.  All four wheels carry the Forester up the steep hills much easier than a two wheel drive car that pulls a vehicle up the inclines.  I can easily tell the difference, which is important to me since I have two steep inclines to travel up on my way home.",pos
This car is all I need- gets good mileage - comfortable for riding - and super hauling for miscellaneous stuff- and is very safe car to operate  - also good insurance rates,pos
"This is my second Subaru foster, and i like Subaru a lot and there seem to be  a great car. this is my 4 subaru",pos
"Great first impression! The view,stability and ride are exceptional. Feature comforts are easily accessible, and easy to get used to. It has been years since we have bought a new car, and advanced technology can be daunting. Subaru has done a great job of keeping the controls in a logical sequence. In future, a power seat for passenger would be nice to help with elderly or people who just had surgery. The Forester is the perfect height for baby boomers getting towards retirement age.",pos
This Forester rides more smoothly than my 2006 model. it's roomier and brighter inside. It's also a little higher and less boxy than my previous Forester.,pos
I have only had this car for a little over a week.  I can say though that I had 2003 Forester that I drove into the outback on my own and I always came back safe and sound.  I just had to go with another Forester when I bought a new car (major engine repairs needed and I just went new rather than repairs to around 3K....it was a tough decision!).  I love this new car with all the bells and whistles.  Yet to know if I end up trusting it as much as the 2003.  Time only tells.  So far so very good.,pos
"This meets all our needs, and I like Subarus for their reliability and comfort.  I like having a car in which we can take two or three passengers also.",pos
"The car is sound, has many safety features. it is easy to handle , runs great in the snow . I drove it home when we had 18 inches of snow. It is quiet and efficient. I would recommend the car to anyone .I feel safe.it has plenty of room and the climate control is wonderful. The heated seats are tremendous. The lane signal is helpful and the blind spot detector, make is more safe .The back up camera is taking me some time t get use to but it is helpful",pos
The vehicle is very roomy and comfortable.  The ride is quiet and smooth.  The AWD handled so well in the snow.  I was sold after the test drive.,pos
Absolutely incredible!!!  I can't say enough great things about this car!!!I wish I would have gotten one YEARS ago!!  Will never be without one and I will convert ALL my friends!,pos
"I liked the Honda Civic hatchback, but the  Forester was even more in command and at 0% interest loan, a better buy for me now",pos
I was researching online and the Subaru kept coming up with high standards of safety and reliability. I was planning on a Honda but after the test drive I chose the Subaru. Handles great and looks great. I look forward to many years of driving this car.,pos
Great improvement over previous models great response in emergency situations. Has all the bells and whistles and then some. Great collision avoidance features very satisfied with my purchase. Has lane keep assist and steering responsive fog lights. Also adaptive cruise control and blind spot detection with lane change assist. Great blue tooth wireless connectivity and power assisted steering. Discovering something new every day. Recommend this model to anyone interested in purchasing a nw car.,pos
"This is the second Forester that I have owned.  It is spacious, comfortable, easy to get into, great visibility, excellent performance. I had tried four other vehicles and kept coming back to the Forester.  It may not win awards for appearance but it gets my vote for everything else.",pos
The car meet my need this is my 3rd subaru my 2018 forest was  totaled in a wreck so I went and purchased another one,pos
"Just recently purchased our 4th Subaru.  History started in 1986.  This is our 2nd Forester, looking forward to excellent things this car provides for us. Car is very comfortable, has lots of power and handles nicely.  Love the back up camera and the safety features it provides!",pos
"This is a plain vanilla model with no special amenities which I did not need. After 1100 miles, I am perfectly satisfied and pleased. In the past I have driven mostly smaller cars, but because of the full time all wheel drive, this model handles very well. Visibility is great! Because it was listed as flood damaged, I bought it from a used car dealer. It had 22 miles on it when I first viewed it, and 70 when I drove it away. For all intents and purposes, it was (is) new, but legally it is used. Thus the answer below.",pos
"I love the style, versatility, gas mileage, and driving ease of this SUV. It feels and drives like a sedan in town but has the all wheel drive and clearance versatility I need for driving on the backroads. The price and financing options are the best I could find after much reasearch. Baby car seat fits easily in the back seat middle. We have an older model that has been worry free.   I have come to expect that of Subaru.",pos
most underrated car in the industry. Does not get the attention it deserves . Passengers in it for the first time are always impressed with the look and drive.,pos
"For the first time since 1979 I bought a new car just for me. The car I have been dreaming about for years a Subaru. I knew how safe Subaru was, I just never thought I would own one so soon. I love the ride, and all the safety features. My salesman was great and very patient with as I tried to decide what color, options, when to actually buy it.",pos
The first forester I purchased was totaled in the first month of ownership and it saved my life.  The second and third one are leases and I have never had a single problem.  It is safe and reliable!,pos
Excellent in the snow. 14 inches of snow today and smooth sailing! Lots of leg room. Comfortable seating. Audio is amazing. Heated leather seats! Heated mirrors in NY cold weather are a MUST,pos
This is our 5th Subaru.  We pass them on to our children.  We are pleased with the car's features and competitive.  The 0% financing was a great kicker.,pos
2018 Subaru Forrester 2.5I Touring has it all. It's classy luxurious sleek styling n comfort. Rides like a limo acts n can climb a snowy mountain with ease. Soft brow leather seats and trim throughout easily gets 34 mph great gps n star link CD radio Sirius radio super roomy n simply made tough.,pos
The car is efficient and drives very nice.  I feel very comfortable driving it.  The gas mileage is awesome as well.  I trust this car with my family 100 %,pos
"The car is peppy, has great visibility (few blind spots),  and is loaded with technology. It's my 4th Subaru. Each one is better than the last.",pos
"The Forester is an amazing car.  Not only is it perfectly beautiful to look at, a Jasmine Green, it is comfortable in so many ways.  We bought the tech package that has the eyesight capability (for lane changing) and the staying-in-your-lane technology.  I can't tell you how great this new technology is!  We got a trial of Sirius Radio, love that too, and the Starlink system is a marvelous safety feature.  Safe, comfortable, reliable, lovely -- we are in love with our car!",pos
This car is just what I needed.  I wanted all wheel drive & a comfortable ride. There is plenty of leg & storage room.,pos
"Great in the snow, roomy enough, good gas mileage, fits in my garage! Have owned several Subarus. Reliable, love the moon roof and heated seats and color of blue.",pos
This Subaru Forester is nicely equipped... ride ability is much improved wind noise is little to none.... skylink is a good addition!,pos
Much improved dash easier to read....quiet ride-less window noise...side mirrors with blind spot alerts,pos
Bigger inside than it looks from the outside. Handles great. AWD is awesome. Good mileage. Good standard features.,pos
"For safety, comfort, styling, and dependability I highly recommend the Subaru Forester.  The layout of controls and safety features led me to select the Forester for protection of my 2 precious grandchildren.",pos
This car is what I was looking for. It is very comfortable to operate. Excellent vision. Sophisticated and efficient. Fantastic ride,pos
"Very comfortable compact SUV, last of the manuals in this model. Limited miles so far...Wish they would make American MT's with LIGHTER fly wheels!",pos
"Best car I've owned in quite a while.  Great Gas mileage, excellent exhilaration and just fun to drive car.  I drive almost 70 miles a day both city and tollway and with the technology and accident avoidance systems on this car it really makes my commute easy.  It's very comfortable to drive and easily fits my associates, two of us who are over 6'4"" and large framed.  Will definitely buy again.",pos
"The Forester Touring is one of the best small SUV’s you can find. This vehicle is equipped with the newest safety features that you can find for the money. Plus you sit up high and there is no hidden viewing areas. The mileage is excellent, not an expensive auto to drive.",pos
"Just recently purchased a new Forester Limited 2.5, my first Subaru. The seats are very comfortable, ride is VERY smooth, yet suspension doesn't feel sloppy. Many vehicles that takes bumps well give up on handling prowess. This Forester does not. This vehicle turns on a dime and feels very confident during spirited driving. In fact, I'd say this turning radius is better than my BMW 330i. The steering feedback is good too. It is not as tight as the CX5, but just felt better to me.  I believe Subaru tuned the 2017 and 2018 to have shorter travel on steering which makes it very easy and fun to drive. My BMW on the other hand is so tight you need two hand when turning fast making it less easy to drive...especially in parking lots.

I read reviews on this vehicle and I cannot believe the number of people that say this vehicle lags behind others in its class on interior design. First off, that is subjective. Secondly, I prefer the clean, Zen layout. I am not a fan of the busy, buttons everywhere style on some...like the Rav4 and Equinox. And the praised CRV with the shifter high on the dash instead of the floor. I don't think that looks good. One point I would agree is I wish it had Android and Apple play. Otherwise, the Infotainment system works great. 

One area the Forester conclusively wins is visability. No vehicle in its class can compare. Big windows everywhere. It feels very big inside. I also test drove the Outback and Crosstek and the Forester just felt more roomy and comfortable. 

I also saw where some said it was slower than some in its class. I didn't test drive them all, but I find it is plenty quick for merging onto a highway...and remember I also drive a BMW 330i. And if one needs more power there is a turbo version. But then you will need to use premium gas and lose mpg efficiency. No thanks on that. The 2.5 has enough for normal driving.",pos
"Nice car w comfort features. Subaru is know for awd, classic vehicle choice. The internet pricing came in handy when negotiating the purchase. The safety feature are sweet; the blind spot notice on the mirrors, Lane monitoring, the speed control and the feature of maintains specific car lengths. Very safe and all automatic. The sound system and available options are plentiful and quality sounding. Navigation aid and mapping is nice. The USB and other component ports enable multi availability to other occupants. Very satisfied w the Forester.",pos
"This car has excellent sight lines and special safety features to help avoid accidents.
The Forester gives a nice smooth ride and is very reliable. Love this car! Best I've ever owned.",pos
I love this car. It has all the rugged looks and functionality you’d expect from a Forester with a beautiful comfortable interior. It makes me wish my commute was longer.,pos
I am 6 feet 2 inches tall. My wife is 5 feet 2 inches tall. We are comfortable driving or being driven. The Forester  makes everyone feel they are in a luxuary car whether in the front or back seats.,pos
"Great view of the road, comfortable, lots of room and one of the safest vehicles on the road today. This is the third Subaru Forrester that I have owned and each one gets better and better as far as safety and comfort is concerned. Lots of room with the back seats down to transport things.  Great in snow for the people that live in the Northeast",pos
My second Forester.  Bought my first in 2014.  It was great.  The 2018 seems just as good.  Very few changes.  I got the Premium this time around to get a few extras.    Rides great.  Wonder vehicle.,pos
"I wanted a Subaru because they have a great rating. When I test drove it, I loved it.  This car handles impressively. This model has many great features such as heated seat, remote start, navigation,and eyesight. I had no issue with it in the snow last night. It is a quiet ride. I have not learned what everything does because I am still learning all about it. I discover something new everyday about it. I have nothing but good things to say about it.  Very nice car.",pos
Wanted something higher than present Corolla so that oncoming headlights would be less of a problem. Second reason was had to have comfortable seats as I have a back problem. Bought the 2nd level above the base model for the 10 way drivers seat. Excellent even the passenger's seat without all of the adjustments. Other vehicle considered was a Rav4. I thought I was going to have to go to the hospital after sitting in the passenger seat for 20 minutes. No comparison. Subaru much more comfortable.,pos
"Love Subaru vehicles.  Very reliable cars that are comfortable, perform well,  sharp looking inside and out and a pretty good value for the money.  This is my 4th Subaru.",pos
This car felt strong and very comfortable.since I’ve three children I will feel very secure inside the car,pos
"It still has that ""new car"" smell. I am very pleased with everything so far. For the most part the controls are fairly intuitive and my sales associate showed my how to use most of them. I look forward to continuing to learn about all the bells and whistles. Consumer Reports top 10 cars in the Spring of 2017. Great gas milage and inexpensive to own. So happy with this purchase.",pos
I LOVE THE FORESTER. FEELS LIKE A SUV WITH A BIT OF SASS. PLAN ON HITTING THE ROAD WITH A SMALL CAMPER IN TOW.,pos
"it is a great car to drive, lots of  toys for the money  the auto has  good pickup,   great radio, so far every thing work  real well",pos
This vehicle fits all our needs.  Plenty of leg room and available storage space.  Looking forward to a long comfy relationship.,pos
"It is a safe, quick and smooth driver. It is a perfect car for my family! Love it! I was originally going to purchase a Chevy Equinox bUT took one text drive of the Forester and never went back!",pos
I bought this car for my wife.....NOW .....I wish that I had got two of them ........LOVE EVERY THING ABOUT THIS CAR...WHAT A PLEASURE TO DRIVE.....THANKS SUBARU,pos
"The Subaru name says it all. I drive for my job and this vehicle provides comfort, reliability, and style.  The 2 tone interior is why I fell in love with the car. It is stylish and unique.  A great car to call my office while on the road.",pos
I presently have three cars-BMW 5 series and BMW X5 both 2017 and our trusty Subaru Forester .I lease the two BMW?s and own the Subaru.If I could get out of my leases on the bmw?s I would and then go get two more Subaru?s.My wife and I fight over who is going to take the Subaru-Hats off to Subaru for it might be the best car I have owned in 45 years.,pos
"The 2018 Forester is a good fit for us.  It is our 2nd Forester.  Our 2014 has been great.  I researched many brands and models and the Forester was a great fit for quality, safety and price.  The visibility is great.  More open then many of the other SUVs.",pos
I use to own a 3010 forester my daughter now has it . I absolutely love my new 2018 Subaru it feels like it actually drives without my help. So comfortable plus saving on gas is amazing also. I highly recommend this car,pos
This car is perfect for my wife and myself. The best is the safety features and with our 2 year old we love that!,pos
"My wife and I first drove a Subaru Forester in North Carolina this past fall.  We drove all over Western North Carolina, looking a property in the Mountains.  This vehicle went every where twisty mountain road, logging roads due to great ground clearance.  Heavy rain wasn't an issue either.  In three days we put over 820 miles on this rental car and it was very enjoyable to the point that we just purchased one for ourselves.  It's very comfortable and price wise very reasonable.",pos
Comfortable ride and great in the snow. This is my second Subaru...after my first Forester I wouldn?t consider another brand.,pos
"We love our Forester.  The handling, convenience, and visibility are excellent.  We picked the Forester over the Honda CR-V because the visibility was so much better.  If you are going to drive to amazing places for great adventures this is the car for you.  The AWD system is far better than any other vehicle in its class and you will be able to immerse yourself in the scenery with its panoramic moon roof.",pos
"This is my third SUBARU.  I love the comfort and smooth ride, and the car maintains it's appearance over years.",pos
"Great ride, very comfortable, and very sturdy.  You get a lot for your money.  The dealership was very professional and clean.",pos
"The Forester is an excellent vehicle even in the snow. It drives like a luxury car with the advantages of an SUV. The all-wheel drive, eyesight technology, moonroof, navigation system and seat warmers are just a few of my favorites. I would highly recommend this car for anyone with a family. It is spacious in both the front and back seats, and the numerous safety technologies that are included make it one of the safest cars on the road.",pos
"At 6'6"", my options are limited, but I'm positive I'd buy the same car again even if I magically lost 11 inches. This car is fuel efficient but powerful, spacious but compact, elegant yet utilitarian... it's paradoxically the best of both worlds in every category. I went for the 2.5i Premium Black Edition, and it's ridiculously slick. The steering-responsive headlights were a luxury I didn't know I needed, but now I can never go back -- driving through the woods and backroads at night will never be the same. I can't say enough good things about this car, so instead I'll just identify the VERY FEW areas that could see improvement:

-- The driver sits a little high. at 6'6"" I still fit great, but it's a slightly unfamiliar position.

-- The CVT can feel kind of chunky at lower speeds. It's not a big deal at all, but I need to find something Subaru can do better for the 2019!",pos
"I've only had the car for 3 weeks, but I love the way it handles, I love all of the features, (Eyesight, Starlink and I feel very safe in it.",pos
I needed to have a smaller SUV and my Forester hits the mark for features and style. It behaves beautifully on the road including through snow and it has a nice tight turn ratio. I’m happy!,pos
I had a 2014 and it saved my life so went back to dealer got 2018 just like the one I had. Would not own anything else,pos
"as a poor snowy road driver, my forester gets me to work and back , and i feel very confident when driving in these conditions.  my first winter with a subaru forester i had snow sitting on my hood after driving thru drifts, and we kept running.",pos
This car is amazing. Peace of mind is what I have every time I step into it. I love it!! I love it!!,pos
"So we live in like the Bermuda Triangle of horrible winter weather, in a “green” town that does not sand, barely salts, and barely plows. And It is ALL Hills.....Forester has done the Subaru 4 Wheel drive snow driving reputation proud! So grateful we got this car. For the smaller size that it is, we are very happy with this car!  Definitely love the all-weather package.",pos
This is my third Forester I font even test drive anything and more I just tell them the color and options I want and I ho pick it up,pos
I just purchased new Subaru Forester.  I love the forester....it's the third one I've purchased. They are reliable and are alwayson the cutting edge with new technology.  I've owned many cars over the last 40 years.....Subaru is the only car I've purchased repeatedly.,pos
"Meets all my needs,lots of light, easy on gas, lots of room,reliable, not too expensive.It is not loaded with too much electronic. It would be good to have a bit more modern communication gadgets.",pos
"Fits all of our needs as busy retirees!  Has room for toys, grandkids and 6’ plus people!  Nice looking too!",pos
Very comfortable car to drive.  Drives well on the highway and city streets.  Love all the new safety features.,pos
"My 2018 Subaru is an exceptional vehicle. It has great, stylish looks, is very comfortable, gets great gas mileage, and the AWD sure came in handy during the recent winter weather.",pos
This car does meet all of my needs. The only time I have anything less then great to say is when I am pulling onto the interstate sometimes I wish it had just a little more GO... other then that the car is amazing.,pos
This car is very useful for us when we go on trips and take our little dog Casey with us it is very roomy and comfortable.  Great on Gas both in town and on the highway.,pos
"I leased a 2015 Subaru Forester and recently purchase a new 2018 Subaru Forest. My lease vehicle was wonderful and I am so excited and happy with my new 2018 Subaru Forester. The ride is smooth, love the all wheel drive, love the interior and exterior. I could not be happier with my new and old vehicles.",pos
"I just bought a brand new Subaru Forester last month and I absolutely love it. I opted for the turbocharged XT Premium model and it has been great: plenty of power, the AWD has been amazing, and the heated seats are a necessary in colder climates. The interior is very functional, with a great amount of room. There could be more space to store possessions in the center console up front. On the first ski trip to the mountains I got to test it in a 2 foot snow storm and it functioned flawlessly. Just what Subarus are made for!",pos
I was very impressed with the vehicle. For an all wheel drive vehicle it drove and handled extremely well. Unfortunately the passenger seat was comfortable for my wife.,pos
"This car meets our needs.  it has the visibility we liked in our old Forester, the new safety features we were looking for, enough room inside for real sized people front and back, and plenty of power, with great economy to boot. We can easily get to 75 mph on an on-ramp, and are currently up to 32.7 mpg.  There are plenty of people willing to help you test the driver assist features (adaptive cruise control, for instance) by cutting in too close, etc., and so far the car has performed flawlessly.",pos
"This is the perfect for road trips! I drove this from Washington State to Southern California with no problems. The hight of the seats and windshield view is perfect. I drove through the snow, ice, dirt, and clean roads without issues. I recommend this to a new first time driver.",pos
"Subaru Forester, meets all my needs. It handles very good, everything in my Forester is great...The radio system is wonderful, I was able to put aLL MY FAVORITES, FROM MY PHONE INTO MY SUBARU...I LOVE THE AWD, WITH THE SNOW WEATHER ITS GREAT AND VERY SAFE TO DRIVE..THIS IS MY FIRST SUBARU BUT IT WONT BE MY LAST....LOVE IT.......EDITH HUTTON",pos
"After looking for almost 6 years to replace my 2006 3.3L V-6 Hyundai Sonata GLS with 215,807 miles, I finally was able to get a new 2018 Ice Silver ""Black Edition"" Subaru Forester and I am very pleases. So far the car handles great and I am looking forward to driving it in the snow! I also like having heated front seats, a back-up camera, moon roof, Harmon Kardon sound system with XM satellite radio, adjustable front seats (didn't have with Sonata), and of course hands free communication calling, etc. Just pleased to also be in a safer car/SUV.",pos
"Awesome automated safety features, eyesight alone is worth the money.  Saved me on a foggy morning with a car without lights coming at me",pos
I have had this car for less then a week and i am in love with it.  It is solid and safe and beautiful.,pos
"Had to get a new car when my beloved 2006 Subaru Forester 2.5 XT (turbo) with manual transmission was totaled... :-(  I used the opportunity to get all the bells & whistles on a 2018 Forester 2.0 XT  Touring. Finally I have Bluetooth connectivity. But even better are the safety features (EyeSight Driver Assist Technology). Adaptive cruise control follows the car ahead, slowing down when it does and speeding back up to the set value when the way is clear. Lane assist will actually move you back into the lane if you drift without signaling. There are too many features to describe! It's kind of like I got a car that will backseat drive my husband for me when I'm not in the car... 
Looks great: I've got the Quartz Blue Pearl with black leather interior. And has plenty of zip: 250 horses... It is a lot of fun to drive.",pos
I had done research before I test drove the Forester and I wasn't disappointed.  It has great performance and styling.,pos
"This vehicle meets our needs for traveling, and outdoor activities we like to do. And it has the space to carry all of our gear.",pos
"Me and my two new knees love this car!!!  New, user friendly features make it even better than my 2015 Forester.  And it rides like a dream!!!",pos
"My new 2018 Subaru Forester  is just fantastic.  This is the third Forester that I've owned and they keep getting better all the time.  Bought it for the safety features, especially Eyesight.  Fuel mileage is tops, too!  Considered the turbo, but it requires high test gas and yields lower mileage, so stayed with the old reliable standard 2.5 engine.  Always enjoyed the CVT and the dash displays encourage the driver to drive softly so as to minimize engine rpms and maximize fuel economy.  Lots of room for my stuff.  Best handling of all the Foresters I've had.  Great lighting, especially for aging eyes!  Very satisfied with my new Subaru Forester.  Dealer (Apple of York, PA) experience was great--no pressure, very helpful and responsive sales staff.",pos
"I am 5’1” and needed to replace my SUV.  I looked at a bunch of different 2018 ones, and they all have the “stylish” curved windows which create problems for me: 1.  The curved windows make for blind spots for me, and 2. because I have to pull the seat way forward, unless I back the seat up every time I exit the vehicle, I have to avoid hitting my head on the curved window frame!!

 Not so with the Forester!  I LOVE the  large squared off windows.  I LOVE the large front windshield!  

I was nervous about going from a V-6 to a 4 cylinder, but my Forester has plenty of zip to pull into busy traffic situations, and on the highway!  I like the slightly smaller footprint,  and the better gas mileage. 

I am also loving the road gripping feel of the car in inclement weather, driving the hills of western MA!  I am so glad I got this car!",pos
"This car meets all my needs. Great styling, comfortable and spacious interior, AWD, heated seats, great mileage, fun to drive.",pos
