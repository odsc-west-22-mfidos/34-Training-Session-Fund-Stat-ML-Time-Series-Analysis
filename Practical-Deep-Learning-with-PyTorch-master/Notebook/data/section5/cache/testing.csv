"I believe this car is for the person who is focused on having a reliable, functional, simple yet user friendly, safe SUV. If you want a car that will change and powder you, this isn't it. This a car for someone who wants some of the luxuries of what is expected in modern cars but not really super fancy. When I set out to find a new vehicle, I looked for, reliability, power, all terrain capabilities, handling, decent looks, space, economy, and comfort. All of these have been met and surpassed. 
<br><br>
The car looks well built and symmetrical. No weird chattering or shaking, no cheap plastics, no seemingly loose parts, and according to my research on engine and trans, they are bullet proof (figuratively speaking). That's to be expected from Subaru though. 5th on the best quality cars in 2015.
<br><br>
 I was afraid that the 170hp 2.5 Boxer would not be enough for an suv but I have never been more wrong. It has ample power and moves briskly. Its not the turbo version by any means but definitely gets out of its own way and, not that I recommend it but, it has enough power and torque for spirited driving, off-roading, and hills. I've never liked a car that cant react quickly to the throttle, and the throttle response is great. I believe Having power is just as important as good breaks and handling to get out of dangerous situations and the forester has it all. I'm also a manual transmission kind of guy and I went with the CVT because of my Girlfriend and the economy. I'm blown away by the performance of this thing. Die hard, traditionalist, Manual trans folks, it ok to trust the CVT its nothing like the laggy ATX's of the past. 
<br><br>
I have not done much off-road driving but what little I have done, I can hardly tell the difference between tarmac and gravel. This car likes to grip the road and not let go. Im newish to AWD and the level of command this car has on less-that-desirable road conditions is outstanding. Compared to something like the RAV4 this is true AWD and behaves as such.
<br><br>
As stated above the handling is great, you point the steering wheel and there it goes. At first I was a little turned off by the lack of steering feedback but the comfort it provides when driving down bad roads is a blessing. You don't have to fight this car, it is under your command and will do your bidding. The body roll is minimal. It has less body roll than many sports cars I have driven, coupled with the symmetrical AWD, its fun on the twisties, for an SUV that is. The braking is also very responsive and I have already had experiences with people cutting me off and it just digs in to the ground but doesn't take away your control. If you want to test a cars brakes, come to Florida during season. This car is Florida season approved, if there was such a thing.
<br><br>
Looks are great, much preferred over the past models Subaru has put out, but then again that's a matter of opinion. The forester doesn't brandish fake scoops or anything to augment its looks and thats how I like it. I like simple and it looks great while being simple.
<br><br>
The space is ample inside. I traded my crew cab chevy 3500 for this and I am happy with the space. Nowhere near a large SUV but I keep thinking its larger on the inside. Might have to name it Tardis but its not blue. 
<br><br>
For the power and space the 2016 Forester offers is really economic. It has enough get-up-and-go but also has superb gas millage and if you find the sweet spot and hit the cruise control you can easily surpass the EPA rating.
<br><br>
The way I define comfort is that the car does what it needs to do when it needs to do it while making the experience a positive one. It doesn't have temperpedic seats with butt warmer and a coffee maker, but as previously stated this is not what Subaru had in mind with this car, or so I think. This does not mean its uncomfortable, I like the seats (great lumbar suport), tilt and telescopic steering wheel is really nice to get that perfect ""in control"" feel. The leg room is ample and the storage is great. Getting in feels like a large car, and looking out of the windshield feels like an suv. The windows are big and there is virtually no blind spot to speak off. a quick glance to the side, after looking out of the mirrors, is more than suited for merging. Batman could drive this and not worry about raising his insurance premiums due to his limited neck rotation. 
<br><br>
Overall, I couldn't be happier with the car, Its what I wanted, something nice, comfortable, reliable, strong, with excellent off-road capability and economy that matches that of cars. Very well rounded vehicle.",pos
"Toyota is the most expensive brand out there based on their internal ""agreements"" they have with dealerships. You get a lot more car for your money looking at other brands. Too much money for the quality of their cars. Materials are borderline cheap and finishes are poor. Interior design is small and not. As comfortable as other brands.",neg
"Just traded in my 2005 Pilot for the new 2018 Pilot Elite.  There is definitely a learning curve to get used to the new technology.  The lane keeping assist and interactive cruise control take some getting used to, but after a week or so you get used to the alarm for steering required and automatic breaking.  Now I am used to the new tech and miss it when I drive my other car.  I am definitely much safer in the new Pilot.",pos
I purchased Subaru Forester 2018 recently and it has been absolutely fantastic ride since. It is a great car with great comfort and style. The inbuilt functions make this car very reliable. Eyesight highly recommended if you are considering to add that feature.,pos
second highlander i have owned. first for 15 years with no problems . now in new mexico with son. if this is as good as first it will last my lifetime,pos
"I traded in my 2010 Toyota Sienna last October. The first thing the 2016 Pilot impressed me is its fuel economy. It is much better than my Toyota van. In the Minnesota winter, I could get average of 20 mpg for mixed local and freeway drivings. The new Pilot is also very quiet, much lower road noise compared to the minivan I had. The ride is so smooth and stable. On a smooth road, you just can't feel the speed you are driving. With the AWD, it handles so well on snow. The car doesn't look big from outside, but sitting inside you feel it's quite roomy. I had 8 adult rides several times and never heard anyone complained. Before I bought the Pilot, I read much about the problems with the same 9-speed transmission on Jeep. But I never had any issue with my transmission. It always shifts smoothly up and down, and reacts swiftly. I guess Honda must have a better software control. The lane keeping technology works very well even with poor road marks, at night, and in rain conditions. I really enjoy driving the 2016 Pilot.",pos
Still love my Subaru Forester especially during the winter months. It is the best vehicle that I have owned.,pos
"I've only had the car for 3 weeks, but I love the way it handles, I love all of the features, (Eyesight, Starlink and I feel very safe in it.",pos
"Excellent purchase. Handles like a van, not like a truck, and similar to a sedan. The leather and interior is excellent. Kids love it.",pos
"My wife and I have already had two Honda Pilots - the last one we had for 9 years. We really wanted to try something different and test drove a lot of cars including Mercedes, Infiniti, Lexus, BMW, Acura, Jeep, and Toyota. We ended up getting the top of the line Elite and have only good things to say about it. To put this into perspective if you go through all the features of the Honda Pilot Elite and price it feature for feature as a Mercedes, it would cost you about $87,000 for an equivalent car. Mercedes make great cars but I would rather save that extra $40,000 for college and take the Honda that will be more reliable, cheaper to run, and have better resale. Whoever led the redesign team - I hope you got a promotion out of this!",pos
"This is an update review for our 2016 Honda Pilot EX that we bought in November 2015. We still love it! We have had no problems with this Pilot. Something we didn't mention in the prior review is that the grand kids love sitting in the 3rd row seats. We sometimes have had their friends along too - all of the kids want to ride in the 3rd row seats. A couple of the kids' friends (under age 12) have told us how much they like this vehicle. Adult friends of ours sat in the driver's seat to determine visibility. They liked it alot. They will be shopping for a Honda Pilot rather than the Toyota Highlander that they had previously owned, since they said the new Highlander does not have good visibility . All in all, the 2016 Pilot EX has been great.
======================================================
Prior review:
We bought our 2016 Honda Pilot EX with Honda Sensing in November of 2015, so we have had it for a year now. So far so good - no problems whatsoever. We owned a 2004 Honda Pilot prior to the 2016, and had no problems with that vehicle either. We feel that the 2016 is quieter and more comfortable than the 2004. We make good use of the versatility of the 2nd & 3rd row seats: most of the time we keep the 3rd row seat folded down to allow hauling of luggage and other stuff to our vacation cottage, or for those stock-up trips to the local warehouse store. Often we fold the second row seats down too for added hauling space. We have also had 7 adults in this vehicle on several occasions with all the seats in the upright positions. That worked out just fine too. Everyone who has ridden in this Pilot loves it. They remark about how quiet and comfortable the ride is. The Honda Sensing allowed for an additional discount on the vehicle insurance too. We appreciate the lane keeper warning, and the comfort in knowing that there is collision avoidance for the front, although that has not ever deployed. We are very happy with this Pilot.",pos
This was the worse buy ever! I love the look of the vehicle but it drives extremely rough  and accelerates on its own. I have now only 15000 miles on it and it feels like it need a new transmission after it was already just replaced in October with only 11000 miles on it. I've been sold a lemon! Do not buy this car!,neg
"DO NOT BUY THIS CAR WHATEVER YOU DO! This car has been nothing but a heart and headache. It is absolutely terrible. Purchased car in the summer of '15 brand new (less than 35 miles) and just recently traded it in (with a little over 26k). If I could give this car negative stars I would. This is a death trap on wheels. While driving this car it literally completely shut off in the middle of the road. I was driving up a steep hill and around a bend. The engine completely shut off and the check engine light came on. I'm so very lucky to not have been hit. After getting car going again (which was a miracle itself) I made it back to my destination. I was 3.5 hours away from home. I attempted to drive it home to have it serviced. It made it less than 15 miles up the road before AGAIN having the engine completely shut off, in the middle of an intersection. $300 and tow to get it to a dealership anywhere close to home. It spent three days in the shop and one long commute to pick up my ""fixed"" car that wouldn't shift out of park. I've lost so much money on this having to trade it in. In just a year and a half it's worth almost HALF of what it was purchased for. I will never ever buy another jeep the rest of my god given days. This car is not worth a stick of gum. If you care about your safety and the safety of others on the road, I wouldn't even look at this car! IT IS TERRIBLE!!! It's the very definition of a lemon!!",neg
"It still has that ""new car"" smell. I am very pleased with everything so far. For the most part the controls are fairly intuitive and my sales associate showed my how to use most of them. I look forward to continuing to learn about all the bells and whistles. Consumer Reports top 10 cars in the Spring of 2017. Great gas milage and inexpensive to own. So happy with this purchase.",pos
"I've bought many Hondas since 1984, mostly Accords and Odysseys, all with bullet-proof reliability, comfort and handling. I decided to treat myself to a new, 2016 Pilot Touring AWD, now that the kids are grown. This is the most comfortable and quiet Honda I've ever owned. That's all the good I can say. The rest is either fair to poor. Handling on curves is somewhat cumbersome. The 9-speed transmission is slow to react to driver demands. If you approach a car on a curve on a 2-lane road, the car senses and flashes an imminent collision. The hood of the car flutters like a flag on a windy day when at highway speeds. The automatic cruise control is good at slowing down and braking when a car jumps in front of you, but recovery to set speed is very slow. The Infotainment system is too complicated to operate and voice commands are recognized only about 50% of the time. The Garmin navigation is excellent though. Last, but not least, reliability is poor in extreme cold. Getting out of work the evening of 12/18/16, the outside air temperature was -15 degrees. My brand-new Pilot stranded me by refusing to start. The engine didn't turn over at all. The next day I called the dealer, he said it was most likely a bad battery and would be replaced. On 12/20/16, I went to go get my Pilot with jumper cables in hand. It was + 25 degrees outside. I decided to try to start it one more time before using jumper cables, and it started immediately. The battery was later tested at the dealer, and the dealer said the battery was fine, with no other explanation of why my new Pilot didn't start at -15 degrees, while every other one of my coworker’s vehicles started with no issues. So sad, no more Hondas for me.",neg
"I got my Limited with all the high tech options and the base 4 cylinder engine. It has more power than my wifes turbo Buick Encore. It revs a bit but I havent noticed a lack of power. Shifting is smooth and it rides better than my Dodge Magnum. The adaptive cruise control is fascinating. The lane departure actually steers you back in your lane. Self parking works without a hitch. I also love the self dimming headlights, rear reclining seats, and the sound system is excellent.",pos
"Traded in 2015 MDX, better value and utility, though drives more like a truck then a sporty MDX. Good for kids and dogs and teenage drivers. Best midsize SUV all around.",pos
"The new Subaru Forester is not an improvement over previous year models.  I had this as a courtesy car for 3 days, so it went on my 45 mile each way work commute which takes me across small neighborhood roads as well as the majors and the turnpike, so all kinds of driving.  I noticed right away that the interior has some line of sight problems. The side windows are junked up with fake little triangle windows  near the front corners, so that the reflection of the interior is plainly visible in the window when  you are trying to look at the side rear view mirrors.  When trying to adjust the rear view mirror to see out the back and sides of the vehicle I accidently hit the on-star emergency button and was promptly given a call.  These small 911 butons turned out to be right above where I put my hand to bring the RW mirror to my height, so rotating the mirror down brought my knuckles into contact witthe call buttons.  Behind me, in the way of seeing to traffic, were the seat belt line from the back cargo area to the center back seat, and all 3 headrests also blocked my view.  The back of the car supplies large corner blind spots so that there is no adjustment that lets you see cars coming from behind you right or left.  I never achieved a position that alieviated the sight problems, and could not find the knob to adjust the outside view mirrors.
The seats are made of a shiny cover material so I was unsteady and  sliding off them, these are ""cloth"" seats, I think, that also had a heated feature with controls front and down on the center console.  The seats are supposed to be buckets, but are so uncomfortable, stiff and slippery that it was more like a personal bench seat.  The dials and knobs on the radio and heat are cheap shiny silver plastic that really feel and look rather low class.  The dashboard is still the sticky soft fake leather that I had in my 2008 Outback and already sported a layer of fuzz and dust that I know from experience cannot be removed. The feel of the ride, compared to my old Outback that needs struts, was just as bouncy and all over the road as my 08, so maybe I don't need that strut job afterall. 
               The Forester has LOTS of headroom, and a moonroof, but the front dash seemed all wrong, nothing was near enough for me to be able to use it easily or without stretching and craning.  Acceleration was awful in that it jerked around, although I am willing to say that maybe that was me not being able to find a comfortable seating position.  In slow and go traffic I had trouble keeping it completely  straight on, and there was a little audio buzzer on the dash to  tell me each time I strayed close to my lane line and yet nothing to tell me when other people were coming into my lane.  Climate controls were hard to figure out -- remember this coming from an Outback owner.  Maybe a larger person than myself would appreciate the shape of this car, but for someone 5 feet 5""  this car was too big and uncomfortable.  When it comes time to replace my 08 Outback I will be looking at something that does not put me in a 4 wheel skyscraper.  I thought it was good on gas, maybe because it has a larger tank than my Outback. But it would also be too tall for me to load my kayak as I am used to doing.",neg
"I was so excited about a new, super safe, fun to drive forester. My forester is all of those things, except I have had it in the shop 7 times in the year and a half I've owned it. Problems with the Hill Start Assist System, and even worse the Eye Sight. Dealer replaced the camera and computer to fix the eye sight, after too many attempt to repair. But as of tonight the 'Check Hill Start Assist' warning displayed for no reason.
So disappointed, car is fun and safe, but I don't feel it is reliable. Worst of all Subaru of America has been sympathetic but has made not real attempt to maintain good customer service or step and and do the right thing and replace the vehicle. ",neg
"Want a massage during your mani /pedi? get one on this car.  Great for a 15 min massage but extremely uncomfortable on long journeys or sitting in traffic for a long time. Plus the steering wheel rocking wildly back and forth after the Odometer reaches 14,000 miles while the transmission is slipping does not feel as safe or comforting as a massage.",neg
"2015 Jeep Cherokee Latitude 4wd V6

First of all I would like to say that I drove a 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited for the better part of 10 years and (except for the gas mileage) I was extremely pleased with the vehicle.  In  fact my granddaughter is still driving that Jeep today.  Because I was so pleased with that vehicle, I purchased a 2015 Jeep Cherokee Latitude and I absolutely love the way my vehicle looks, handles and drives as well as the gas mileage and comfort.  For the most part it serves my needs very well.  The only problem I have with my Jeep is outlined below:

In the beginning I had no problems with the way the vehicle performed, but after about 3000 miles I began experiencing problems with the 9 speed electronic transmission.  After slowing down to a near stop and then accelerating, the transmission will hesitate before engaging into the proper gear.  Because of this I almost had two accidents,  one of which caused me to come very close to running through the wall in my garage.  Also, if I start moving forward and give the vehicle maximum acceleration, when I release the accelerator pedal, there is a substantial delay before the vehicle stops accelerating. 

Further, I have tried numerous times to use the manual shift feature to downshift to slow the vehicle down when driving down steep hills.  There is a significant delay (several seconds) after I attempt to down shift before the transmission actually responds and by then the speed of the vehicle has increased such that the engine speed increases to over 5000 RPM when the shift occurs.  For my use, the manual change feature on the Jeep is absolutely useless.

Relative to the 9th gear, I have checked the transmission gear readout numerous times by moving the shift lever left, and I have never seen the transmission indicate that it was in 9th gear.  In fact it will only shift to 8th gear when I am going down hill.
Occasionally, after coming to a stop and then starting up, the transmission will lock up in 1st gear and I have to accelerate up to about 25 miles per hour before it shifts and then it shifts quickly through several gears.  I can also force it to change by getting the engine speed up to about 2500 RPM and then letting off the accelerator thereby allowing the gears to change.

I have explained and demonstrated all of this to the service manager at the dealership where I bought the vehicle and they have been most accommodating it trying to alleviate the problems I have had with the transmission.  They have even replaced the transmission, to no avail.  I still have the same problems and I am told by the dealership that this is all normal and within the designed operating parameters of the transmission. 

I have subsequently contacted Chrysler Customer Care and they opened a case number in my name (refer to above case number) wherein I was instructed to take the vehicle back to the dealership again.  Upon taking the vehicle back, I was told once more that the transmission is performing within design operating parameters and their diagnostic test do not indicate any problems.  Chrysler Customer Care contacted the Area Manager and he said that since the vehicle was operating as designed, there is nothing further that they would do for me.  They suggested that I change the way I drive to accommodate the way the vehicle is performing.  They have subsequently closed the case.

This is a totally unacceptable conclusion.  I have driven other new Chrysler products with automatic transmissions and they do not in any way perform the same as my Jeep.    I do not know what to suggest as a solution to my dilemma, but  I am extremely uncomfortable with driving my jeep even though circumstances force me to do so.  I am fairly certain that there are other Cherokee owners that are having the same issues with their vehicle and I would be very surprised if there weren't some related accidents.

Have subsequently traded for a new Grand Cherokee with 8 speed.

"Being in the military with limited income keeps my options low in regards to what I can afford for car payments.  I just got married and my wife just found a job in the Seattle area so we needed a 2nd car.  After looking at used vehicles, we came across Jeep's President's Day sale and they were offering $5K rebates for downpayment plus discounting the sticker price for all basic Cherokee Sport models. So we were actually paying less than what we were looking at for used Cherokees.  I wasn't impressed with the acceleration but it is a 4 cyl. My wife liked the features and it was new! So we pulled the trigger. 500 miles into the car, we realized there was puddling water at driver and passenger sides.  It was storming so I asked if her door was shut.  It was.  We drove it back to our dealer who proceeded to hold onto it for over a week.  Not once did they contact us.  We had to initiate the discussion and they seemed upset that we were upset.  A response of ""that's why there's a warranty"" doesn't comfort a consumer when the cause was a body part that needed to be welded shut, seals in the door and windshield that needed to be replaced/resealed.  It simply shows shoddy workmanship and low grade parts quality.",neg
"The hood flaps in the breeze at high speed with a cross wind.  The push button transmission is a pain.  The automatic braking feature is dangerous.  I have had several near accidents because the brakes are automatically applied.  Instead of the brakes being applied normally, they are slammed!  The drivers behind me are none too happy.  I have learned a whole new language as they pass me and give me the one finger salute.  Getting my vehicle washed is a joke.  You have to go through a series of button pushing to keep the vehicle from being damaged.  Now, I have to take it to a self wash facility.  Honda has found a way to ruin the new car experience with a CD instead of an owners book.  there are several other things that are very annoying but not worth the trouble to list.  If you buy one, make sure you understand EVERYTHING about the operation of the vehicle before taking it off the lot.  This was my first and last Honda.

Your going to love the rear seat belts....trying to put them back into the ceiling when not in use...Nothing has change as far as my opinion of the Honda vehicle.  Over rated and over priced.  My next vehicle will be American Made!  
Regarding the hood flapping in the breeze:  I had the vehicle into the Honda service department for this problem twice and they could not fix it.  They blamed the ""Honda"" bug deflector for the problem so I called the Zone Office and explained to the problem I was having.  A snotty woman told me that because the bug deflector was and ""after market"" product, they couldn't/wouldn't help me.  I tried several times to explain to her that the bug deflector was a Honda product to no avail.  SO-----I took off the bug deflector and took the vehicle for a ride......YUP!  Hood still flaps in the breeze at highway speeds and is very unsafe.  SO----- I called the zone office again and explained the situation to the person that answered the phone.  I was told that I would have to take it into the Honda dealer.  When I explained that I had already done that more than once, I was told there is nothing Honda can do.  JUNK, JUNK, JUNK.",neg
"This car is a great compromise for the big family that doesn't want to go ""minivan"". My 7&10 yo kids love the 3rd row & can get in/out without assistance. 3rd row access for adults is not terrible for the smaller physically fit, but more challenging for the larger or not so athletic (like getting into the back of a 2 door coupe). But once you're there leg room & comfort aren't bad for a 3rd row. If wanting to seat adults in 3rd row, I still suggest minivan with 2nd row captains chairs. Also, since the 2nd row does not offer captains chairs or removable center seat (unless you go Elite trim $$$) it's a bench with a 60:40 split. So if you put 1 car seat in 2nd row, you can access the 3rd on the opposite side. If you put 2 car seats in 2nd row, you can't even get to the 3rd row because you can't fold the seat forward with a car seat on it. So just keep that in mind if you have lots of littles. My 2 are just using the 3rd row, leaving the 2nd for guests. & they have folded the 2nd flat & use it for a foot rest or game surface (cards, battleship) for trips. My kids are happy to have AC vents & controls in the 2nd row, but have been complaining of low air flow in 3rd row vents. I have to crank it on extreme High to get any air into those way back vents. But it has been 100F this month so may just be a summer thing. Overall we absolutely love our Pilot EX. And our insurance rate went down with all the safety specs, despite the hefty purchase price! A very welcome surprise 👍🏻",pos
"I took my time purchasing the new Pilot because of the questionable reviews early on, particularly around the transmission, entertainment system technology, and fit/finish. We have been very pleased with the vehicle overall. I took the car for a lengthy test drive to ensure that I was comfortable with the transmission. While it has a slight lag from a full stop while in Economy mode, I don't feel that is excessive, perhaps because I've owned other fuel efficient vehicles that don't provide immediate acceleration. It does accelerate just fine once it does take off. And I have not experienced any of the gear-searching that early reviewers mentioned.

The active safety technology is pretty incredible, particularly for longer highway trips. Auto high-beam headlights, auto wipers, blind spot information system, and adaptive cruise control/lane-keep assist system all make the driving experience almost effortless. Problems with fit and finish from early on appear to have been addressed, as our vehicle has no such issues.

The only thing that does feel somewhat unrefined is the Auto Engine Off idle stop functionality, which can be turned off, albeit impermanently. If it is particularly hot or cold, you will likely want to turn off the Econ mode to maximize heating or cooling from the HVAC system.  And I still prefer Google Maps on my phone to the Nav system. 

All in all, we are very happy with our purchase.",pos
"I wish I had read the Consumer Affairs complaints before buying my 2016 Toytota Highlander XLE.   I've only owned my car for 30 days and already had an issue with the car starting on its own.  Yes!  That's right.  I walked up to my car after shopping at WalMart for 40 min. only to find that it had started up by itself, and must have been running while I was in the store with the doors locked.  Upon entering the car, a yellow caution light was flashing near the odometer.  I read many consumer complaints and found another person complaining of the same problem and was told that it can happen when the remote entry keypad is pushed twice after exiting the vehicle.  After reading many other customer complaints about various issues with 2013-2015 brakes not working while driving (Yikes!), driver doors not unlocking, and front seats making loud noises while driving, I wish I had read those complaints before purchasing this vehicle.  It sounds like the 2013, 2014, and 2015 may be lemons.  I'm not sure about the 2016 yet, because the car is too new to know for sure, but I'm very concerned about what's to come.  I don't feel 100% safe in this car, especially since I have 2 kids.  This is my 2nd Toyota.  I just sold my 2006 Sienna minivan and it had many defective issues/recalls.  I will not be buying a Toyota in the future because they don't stand behind their cars.  They only try to blame the customer for their defects.
UPDATE after 30 days of driving - The sound system is terrible.  My Sienna minivan had a JBL sound system which was great, but the Highlander has a cheap sound system with a horrible muffled sound.  After driving the car a little while, you will notice that the interior has many cheap parts!!  The floor ""carpet"" is actually felt, not carpet, and some of the dash has plastic parts.  The front seats and angled headrest are very uncomfortable on longer rides.  Wish I could trade my new XLE in for a well made car that matches the price I paid.  The quality just isn't in the 2016 Highlander for the high price.   Still disappointed.",neg

"I've been driving my Subaru Forester for almost a year now.          Pros: Safety is huge - my work responds to accident scenes and I've seen a survival in this vehicle I wouldn't expect in others.  I loved the way it drove in the snow last winter, it gripped the road while others were skidding out all around me.  I was able to drive through a foot of unplowed snow uphill! The back seat has enough leg room for my babies (who are each 6 feet tall).  The gas mileage is great, visibility is great and I love the huge sunroof.     Cons: The new touch screen has issues.  Once in a while it won't work unless I turn the car off and turn it back on.  Sometimes my phone isn't recognized by the bluetooth.  I wish there was moor light in the rear cargo area.  There's a strange pause when I shift gears.  It feels questionable when I take corners faster than I should.  Overall, I'm happy.",pos
"I really love this vehicle and will consider buying or leasing another one when my current lease is up. Some concerns I have is the third row seating will not accommodate an adult, I would like to see Toyota extend the length of the vehicle by 6"" to make the third row of seating comfortable for an adult. It would also be nice if the captain chairs in the second row were ventilated like the front seats. Also the headlights need to be converted to  halogen bulbs because current lights aren't bright enough.",pos
"I got a basic version - LX AWD. Very happy with the choice. All complaints appear to be about the features that I do not have anyway (touch display, 9sp transmission, sensing, etc.). I am a technical guy, but the level of technology on the basic model is just enough for me. It has everything that I (and my iPhone) need – maybe I would add an outside thermometer (really, Honda? Bluetooth, voice commands, rear camera, but no outside thermometer?) and homelink (otherwise $12 clip-on garage opener from Amazon does the job). I drove 1,000 miles so far and the ride is very enjoyable. I get ~25 MPG average with slightly overinflated tires (36 PSI). For the car of this size and power it is outstanding, IMHO. The handling, acceleration, comfort levels are superb. My wife claims that this is the first car that she can read a book in without getting nauseous. Take it for a ride and you will see what I am talking about. Just make sure that the “economy mode” button is not “on” – it is good on a highway, but for a city ride this mode is sluggish (feels like the “wow factor"" is missing). P.S. I went to YouTube and watched some videos of people abusing 2016 Pilot in off-road winter conditions. It is jaw dropping. Can’t wait for the snow to check it myself.",pos

The 2015 Honda CRV we purchased shudders significantly when accelerating.  It makes for a rough ride and will impact resale.   It is now in the Honda service department.  They said:
1) There is a transmission problem the 2015 CRVs.  Honda is aware but doesn't have a fix.
2) They did mentioned a software Patch yesterday but retracted that comment today. 3) They don't know what else to tell me.

Car drives great on the highway and I have been receiving 29-30 mpg around town. Despite some reviews I read about this car using oil, my car has not used a drop in between 2 oil changes. Highly recommend this car. Just turned 36,000 miles this September 2016. Car still getting 29/31 miles per gallon in the city. Have not had a problem so far.

"Hit a deer with my 2015 Forester and totaled it. I liked it so much, I bought a 2017 Forester, but not before I test drove just about everything in its price range. The Forester still suited my needs best for economy, real 4wd ability, roominess , handling,  ground clearance, and acceleration from a stop. I rated this car highly in just about every category compared to similarly priced suvs . The CVT transmission is particularly well suited to this car, reacting quickly to throttle input on hills and stop signs where others searched for gears or just would not get the car moving in a timely fashion creating some hairy moments when trying to get into traffic. When going on a trip, my wife wants to take everything, including the sink, but somehow, we manage to get it all in. Muddy fields, washed out farm roads, and interstates have been no problem. I am not saying this is the best suv out there, but it is hard to find a base model suv that will do most everything well. This one comes as close as anything I could find, in 2015 and 2017.",pos

Very comfortable inside and the extras with the SE(cool rims, ambient lighting, stitch designed leather seats) give her a ""cool mom"" feel.",pos
Its made by Fiat. 8 speed transmission a joke. Hemi engine the only saving factor. Electronics very poor compared to 2011 vehicle. Unable to fix problems with electronics .

On Edit: After two weeks at the dealership, the problem could not be found. The dealer gave us another new Grand Cherokee with the same options. Chrysler gave us an extended warranty on the replacement car. We are happy with the new Jeep. The old one is still out there and the problem was never diagnosed. The dealer is using it as his daily driver and being diligent in witnessing the problem first hand.",neg

"I love the look and technology of this car. I own a 2014 GC Limited. UConnect it great. Love that I can start my car from my desk. Not the best navigation. And now on to the transmission, terrible. Car doesn't shift gears properly. Car is constantly jerking because it is not in the proper gear because it didn't downshift/upshift properly. If you slow down for a red light but do not completely stop when you step on the gas the car doesn't go then suddenly jumps to 3rd for 4th gear causing the whole car to jerk. Make a turn across traffic at your own risk...because of the shifting problem car will hesitate (stop) and although you may have enough time to complete the turn you might not. Been to dealership 5 times and their answer is ""that's not abnormal."" I have had 3 updates in 6 months but none have fixed the problem. At first all I wanted was the car fixed...now I am feeling a little burned. My money was good enough to take, including the purchase of the protection warranty (covers all different parts of tranny but not whole tranny)but I am not significant enough to have my car fixed. Just want to get rid of it at this point.",neg
"Without going into much detail (because it would consumer several pages), I have been in the dealership for repairs over 30 times in 15 months, which includes several recalls.

"We purchased in Sept. 2016  We had looked at several comparable vehicles but decided to go with the Jeep due to pricing.  That was a mistake.  You get what you pay for.  It was inexpensive, because in simple terms it stinks.  From the very beginning it has burned excessive amounts of oil.  We took to the dealership and were told that a quart of oil every 1,000 miles is normal.  Well, that's not normal in my opinion for a brand new vehicle.  I have an 11 year old Chevrolet that does not come close to burning that much oil.  We were advised to check the oil every time we fill up with gas.  What a joke.  They performed an oil consumption test which resulted in them telling us they would send the findings to the manufacturer.  We called several times to check status of the oil consumption findings only to be told that they hadn't heard back from the manufacturer.  Two weeks ago, while driving the Jeep in rush hour traffic the engine light started flashing and service transmission light came on and car went into limp mode.  I was almost rear ended because car wouldn't move.  I was finally able to slowly move over 3 lanes and pull into a parking lot.  I shut the car off and once I restarted it, it seemed to be fine.  I got back on the road only to have this happen 3 more times before I could make it to my destination.  The dealership was contacted only to not return our calls.  We took the car in the next morning and haven't seen or heard from the dealership since.  My advice - DO NOT BUY A JEEP.  WORST CAR I'VE EVER OWNED.",neg
"I purchases this vehicle in August of 2015. I put roughly 3,300 miles on it. While driving it on December 12 the transmission failed and I was stuck on the side of the Hwy waiting 4 hours for a tow truck. The dealer replaced the transmission and I was able to pick up my vehicle yesterday December 29th. On the way home I noticed a couple odd sounds while driving at highway speeds (55-60 mph). I now have about 3,400 miles on the car so it will be interesting to see if the transmission simply needs a break in period or if I will experience this trouble again. I love everything else about the vehicle, I am just hoping that it will be reliable from this point forward.",neg
"Leased 2nd in May 2017, I wish I could keep 2014 XLE which was much better car with very minor issues. New 8 speed transmission is very slow, jerky and non responsive, GDI engine doesn’t help to get better mileage than the old one. The start- stop feature does effect nothing about efficiency, probably will create a mechanical issues. There is no improvement in driving experience; it is still comfortable but steering doesn’t give any feedback, suspension makes much more noise than previous one. There is no update on the Entune system, it looks and works like designed by amateur software team. Also material quality is far behind the new generation SUVs. 
There are still some good things about the car; good size, roomy interior, good snow traction, exterior design is better than other Toyotas, standard safety features works fine.
Competition is getting hard in this segment, Toyota needs better chassis, transmission, electronics and material quality in and out. I had 4 Toyotas, this would be the last, the new Camry doesn’t give any hope for the new Highlander that always shares the same platform.

If it was not for my Honda Pilot's durability and air bags, I don't know if I would be alive or extremely injured. I walked away with a broken arm and sprained ankle and some bruises.

"I traded from a 2016 Acura MDX to a Touring CR-V and I can honestly say it feels like a slightly scaled down version Acura. Sure the performance cant match the Acura, but its a sprightly driver, it handles well, its nimble to park and is spacious for such a small footprint. I am more than willing to give up a little acceleration, and really its not that much acceleration, for a huge jump in mpg and on regular instead of premium. The seats are very comfortable and Im a big guy and can comfortably sit in the backseat behind my drivers seat setting. As far as electronics, its very similar to the Acura in terms of the audio, lighting, door and window optional settings and the LED lighting including the headlights is great. I understand they put a volume button back on the dashboard but it really needs a tuning knob too. It does not have a CD player but no car will probably have one in a few years going the way of 8 tracks and cassettes. I wish it came with a panoramic sunroof like the Canadians get. I gave up only a couple features like the CD player and an auto-adjusting steering wheel, but gained automatic hi-low headlights and the remote start. Ive been getting around 28-29 mpg in town and have gotten as good as 36 mpg on the highway on a road trip. Hondas have always been noisy but this is overall pretty quiet, but you do hear wind noise at highway speed. It isnt the roar of tire and wind noise of old from Honda though. I like the front end and profile a lot, it makes it feel more substantial but the rear end needed a little more work. The taillights are cool but it didnt need a big chunk of chrome between them trying to compete for attention. Honda could have put the chrome strip lower above the rear license plate area and it would have looked better. The back end isnt all that pretty but it sure is functional and there is a ton of storage space in back and the kick under the bumper opener works well. Overall my gripes are pretty minimal, because so far its showing itself to be a really comfortable, practical and pleasant driver that delivers lots of luxury features at an affordable price. Im not missing my Acura at all.",pos
"1.  Navigation. Resets at toll booths. Continually recalculates. Requires three different shots on two screens to show a turn. Cannot adjust frequency, so you will be told 4 times in the last mile before approaching a toll booth. 

After one year:  the GPS in downtown Chicago is constantly one street off.  You have to stop, turn off the ignition and start again.  The GPS will constantly take you to a toll booth or major intersection and then reconfigure.  

After two years:  Friday the GPS system froze and then went blank.  I did not pay the update fee, but it is completely dead now.  

2.  Vibration. I have now had the car in 5 times. I have had all of the parts replaced, the software fixes. It still vibrates. It gives me a headache.   The winshield split across the middle one day.  

After one year:  the vibrations never stopped.  Its just such an awful car after a while its kind of funny yet sad.  

After one year:  I wanted blue tooth for the phone, had to stop using it.  Those on the other side constantly complain about the noise.  The car has numerous rattles.  I maintain the car religiously as I drive a lot.  

After two year:  the vibrations continue.  I usually put the car in neutral at stop lights to stop the shaking.

"My 3 year review, same old problems. Car still shakes and stalls when cold.  Not sure why people think Honda is so great. I have a 2014 Acura MDX that I put 3000 into this year and is very expensive to insure. I will never buy another Honda product. I just bought my son a 2017 Subaru Impreza,  we will see how they hold up but I’m done with Honda and their crappie engineering. Also, who thought that blind side camera was a good idea?  I can’t change directions on my gps while I’m drive but I can be blinded at night with that camera. My 2 year update. I still have stalling issues when I back out of my garage.  I will take it into Honda again and I'm sure they will say the same thing that they can't get it to duplicate.  I have called Honda several times and they say this is not an issue. I had a Ford Expedition with close to 200k miles that I now regret getting rid of. I would not recommend a Honda. Also the vibration issue is real and Honda does not care. They act like they have never heard of this. My father had a 1984 VW Rabbit diesel and this engine reminds me of that car.  My 1 year update-  while I still like the car, I have experienced many of the same problems other CRV owners have complained about. The worst problem by far is the CVT transmission. Many days I back the car out of the garage and experience a violent shutter and the car stalls.  I haven't taken it back to the dealer because they will just say we can't get it to do it and it will just add to my frustration but I plan to drop it off when I leave for vacation next month so they can thoroughly test it.  There is a definite shaking when at idle as the car RPM,s adjust up and down.  The first car I drove was an old diesel VW rabbit and this engine is similar in noise but While it's not very Honda like I accepted that during my shopping but just know it doesn't get better if anything it gets louder. Disappointed that Apple Play will not be added. As I said in my original review Japanese car manufacturers have the worst technology but the dealer said it would be added in the next few months. I know a car salesmen who lied shocking. This is my first Honda after mainly Fords. Would I buy another Honda🤔?  Probably not. 

I wanted to give an honest opinion on the Honda CRV after hesitating due to the vibration issue.  I didn't want to spend more than 30k, I wanted AWD, room for 4 adults with space for cargo. I looked at the Rav 4, Forrester, Rogue,Escape and the CX5.  None of them were perfect but the Honda was either as good or better in every area.  As for the vibration issue, I've noticed at a red light, the engine goes into a very low RPM that does provide a slight vibration.  I honestly would not have even noticed it, if not for the negative reviews. This small CUV is roomy,safe,comfortable, good gas mileage and really holds its value. After 1 month and 1,000 miles, I would highly recommend it.",neg

"First, please understand I was driving a 2008 KIA Sportage manual shift and was very happy with it, when my wife told me it was time to get a new vehicle. Hey, I don't have to be told twice.

I did a lot of research, and a lot of looking, and the new KIA's did not suit my purposes. I do a lot of kayaking and other outdoor activities. The new KIA's roof rack design was not conducive to carrying sea kayaks, plus they haven't been highly rated.  I also looked at the Toyota RAV-4's, and have experience with the Honda CRV since my wife has one- none seems to be the package I was looking for. 

The more I read, the more I thought the Forester was just what I needed. Not the sportiest vehicle out there, but reputed to be reliable, good gas mileage, good traction, and roomy without being overly big. 

The Forester turns out to be beyond my expectations. The kayaks fit easily, and I haven't noticed any decrease in the MPG with them on top. I have been averaging about 29 MPG on non-highway driving. I love the moon-roof, and the entertainment system is great.  All the usual driving controls are very intuitive. I've heard complaints about acceleration, but I find it peppier than my old Kia- not a problem merging onto the interstate. The car handles nicely on our winding back country roads, and the high clearance was perfect for the dirt ""roads"" in the Adirondacks that I frequent.  It is quieter than my Kia, and the CVT seems to work much smoother than a traditional auto transmission. There is good visibility while driving.

I also read extensively about the oil burning problem reported on older models- this gave me some pause, but after grilling the sales person and service manager, I was assured the problem had been fixed. And so far I haven't used a drop of oil in over 2500 miles. I'll keep an eye on it, all the same.

There are only a few things I would like to see improved. The dashboard material is very hard to keep clean- the pollen and dust stick readily to it. The instrument panel display (speedometer, etc.) are the nice red backlighting (protects your night vision)  when the lights are on, but the sound system is an LED screen, which I find excessively bright at night. Unfortunately there is only one dimmer switch, and when I decrease the brightness to suitable level, I can barely see the speedometer panel.

Another minor annoyance is the design of the door trim. I have long legs, and tend to sit splay legged when I drive, therefore my knee rests against this protruding trim. After an 8 hour drive across the state, I found I had pressure marks.Another adjustment I've had to make is the delay when moving from reverse to drive. Seems to lag a little. It may just be my transition to an automatic from a manual, but I do have to be aware of the change in timing for when I back out onto the road- I need more lead time to keep others from getting perturbed.

 The ""all weather"" mats that come as part of the ""upgrade"" package are quite cheap and ineffective. Subaru should be embarrassed. They would be better off contracting with Weather Tech to make some decent mats- particularly at the sticker price they put on these crappy things.  
The only other ""regret"" I have is the interior color. I got the blue exterior, which is really snazzy, but I didn't pay much attention to the seat color, which is a very light shade. I can see that down the road these are going to get grimed up. I guess you can argue the light color seats will be cooler in the summer- but living in the north, that is not a great benefit. I can't fault Subaru for my choice- just be aware.

Overall, I am very happy with my new Forester, and I expect to be driving it for years to come.",pos
"I've had my 2014 Higkander for 1 year, 8000 miles in, and I must say, it's near perfect. Not a single problem. Super smooth ride   Beautiful interior. Great acceleration, fantastic gas mileage. 
I have 2 caveats. My biggest issue is the second row. While  it is very roomy, and fits 3 across, the middle seat is not comfortable or practical. I have 3 kids, and liked it because I could fit 3 across in the second row, and load up the back with the third seat folded down for vacation and trips to the beach    However, the middle seat is not very comfortable. Because if the console, it protrudes out, is very hard, and is not practical for long trips. So I have to put my youngest in half the the third seat, and jam in luggage or beach stuff next to her. 
Besides that, this is a luxury vehicle for a very affordable price. 
Perhaps a bit more room behind the third seat would be nice too. 
Besides that, if your looking for a 3 row SUV that's classy, super smooth, and problem free, don't even think about getting anything else. 
I had a 2001 navigator before this.  While I loved the size, it was fraught with constant problems.   Expensive problems.",pos
"Bought this car for my wife, mostly because it had sweet safety ratings and distracted driver assistance. Rides quiet and fine. Looks okay, but could be a little more stylish. Safety seems excellent. Love the Eyesight, which prevented me from rolling into a car which inexplicably stopped in front of me. The first disappointment was the mileage, which was significantly lower than the sticker estimate (24/32), and one reason I chose this vehicle over other options. Suburb/highway combined mileage netted just under 24, whereas highway never topped 26. Interior was the major disappointment here, and mostly on things you wouldn't know without using the SUV for a while. The fabric on the ceiling is pretty flimsy, easily soiled and hard to clean. But the worst is the super-thin plastic interior of the cargo area. We placed some suitcases back there for a trip to the beach, and it busted a hole in the plastic wall surrounding the compartment. On closer inspection, I could see how ridiculously-thin the material was. Guessing this was used either for weight/mileage, or cost, but it could be described as an interior crumple zone, because the next hard object that goes in there will likely bust another hole in it. Can't imagine someone using this vehicle to move any sort of equipment or even making a trip to the hardware store. Seriously cheap. If they haven't upgraded the cargo interior and ceiling fabric in later models, I'd look at other manufacturers, who now have similar driver's assistance systems available. Oh, and the manager never called my wife back when she wanted to talk about the interior damage, so won't be going back there (Herb Gordon, MD).",neg
"What's not to like about the newly designed Forester (2014)? Hardly anything: the shorter wheelbase creates a bit of a bumpy, firm ride. The CVT transmission revs up loudly when you push the pedal down to accelerate onto the freeway. That's it! But things to like far outweigh those. A true 31.3 mpg driving over thousands of miles in the mountains and on interstates at 70 mph. An interior that is huge and comfortable for all---even the backseat passengers. Tinted side windows that block lots of sun. A huge sunroof. Electric driver seat that moves forward-back, up-down, tilt forward-back, and the lumbar adjustable seat back that tilts too. An oil filter on top of the engine that's easy to change. Beautiful metallic paint. A price negotiable to under $25000 for the premium level trim. No repairs as of yet after almost 60 K miles. All-wheel-drive that handles Colorado's deep snows with 8 inches clearance. A fairly decent information monitor with lots of different data screens. (The newer ones are even better (2015 and 2016). Subaru has things all figured out with these cars. It's our second after the 1998 Forester's engine finally died at 273,000 miles.",pos

"I came from a 2007 Honda Civic LX, I looked, and test drove most of the main players.  I tried the CRV, Rogue, Tiguan, CX-5, and the Outlander.  I had it narrowed down to these.  I had previously owned Ford, KIA, and Hyundai products..never down that road again.   They all had their strong points, but after you take all those and combine them, you end up with the Forester.  I love the styling, and the ride.  The only downside is the poor OEM tires.  The Yokohama Geolanders, well they just suck.  Besides the tires, I love the layout and the functionality inside.  I find the seats are comfortable (I've had back surgery).  No excess noises or rattles.  The stereo is nice with the bluetooth connectivity, and the USB ports inside the center console.  If you are looking for a comfortable CUV with a can do attitude, check out the Forester.

"Former owner 2005 pilot my wife loved 2005 pilot and took better than excellent care of it Honda offered a offensive  trade in value of $5000 on a new 2016 pilot, even after bring offended with trade in offer and because my wife liked the pilot we had for over 11 years I went ahead and bought the 2016 pilot and gave the 2005 pilot to my daughter. I knew the 2016 pilot was not equipped as well as most other makes in same price range, what didn't know was how poor the quality and function of included equipment is! Interior so called leather looks like cheap plastics, hands free phone system is a joke you can't understand what callers are saying, Honda put in new microphone (didn't help) would like to disable system so it won't interfere with cell phone,back seat entertainment is so difficult for children to use and requires someone in front to help, the kids use iPad instead, also there is no connection in back seat to recharge iPad has to be connected at front seat, Car is under powered if you use fuel economy feature, the only real complaint I had with 2005 pilot was road noise 2016 pilot is little or no better 11 years later, weather striping around doors is as flimsy and cheep as I have ever seen.

"Subaru has hit a home run with its Forester 2016. This is a very optimal vehicle, refined design, excellent safety rating. Really love the drive and handling.

"I own the 2016 Trailhawk V6 3.2L engine with tow package. Mango Tango! It was love at first sight; a work of art with unsurpassed comfort! But it's been just one year (14K miles) and I no longer feel safe in it, nor can I count on it to get me to my destination. Today, I write this review from my back deck when I should be enjoying my camping vacation, however for the 4th time in a 6 week period, the car completely shut itself down. Twice in the last few weeks the car has just shut itself off, requiring me to pull over. Each time it restarted after a few minutes. Thank goodness it was always where I could pull over. Today however, packed for my vacation, camper in tow, traveling 65mph EVERYTHING shut down: the electronics and the transmission. Dead as a doornail. No power brakes, no power steering. Nothing. Roadside assistance sucks. It took two hours for them to get a wrecker to me, but refused to take it to my local dealership, a whopping 4 miles further than the ""closest"" Jeep dealership, and made me abandon my camper. Furthermore they told me they would not get me home from the dealership they were willing to tow to (placing me 85 miles from home). So I paid the wrecker guy the FOUR MILE difference to take the car to my local dealer and my son-in-law rescued the pop up. I can't say enough for the service guys at my local dealership who did a diagnostic on the car first thing the following morning (Monday) to try and get me back on the road, but they could not replicate the issue and returned my car to me. :( I guess I'm stuck driving a $40K safety risk until this happens again, and again. Here are a few other things that annoy me about this car: the cruise control is a joke. Unless you are on flat land, it will take off on you going down hill as though it isn't engaged. I've had the car bolt from 55 to 68mph of its own volition. You can't turn off the radio; you have to mute the volume every time you get in the car if you don't want to listen. Bluetooth connects sporadically and often can't send messages or takes several minutes to respond. If your iPod/iPhone is connected to a USB port for charging, you can't get it to run through the speakers for music. I just paid $3K for the extended service plan; looks like I'll be needing it.  This vehicle has a history of issues. ITS TIME CHRYSLER DOES SOMETHING ABOUT IT; 3 MODEL YEARS IS ENOUGH!

"Really love the car but getting scared off it. Had it at the dealer to be told there is nothing wrong with it but it shakes so bad above 68 mph, I'm about ready to blow my top. Bought a new set of tires about 9 months ago (crv only had about 30K miles) hoping it would alleviate the problem and even went through the pains of having the tires true'd twice (process in which they shave the rubber off the tire to make them round while mounted to the car) with no luck, dealer wanted to blame the tire manufacture so I went and bought another set of tires, this time I bought some really high end tires but got the same effect, steering wheel shaking like a wheel is hopping. Ride is so poor... Really think I won't buy another one of these, love the car but can't deal with this anymore, come on Honda, step up to the base here, the touring is the Cadillac of the crvs, think I would rather had gave my money for what I spent on this to someone who was selling a 1980s Yugo than you, at least with those, they road like a Cadillac!",neg

The Trailhawks unique Italian-inspired design and muscular stance is eye catching. Something to be aware of: snow chains are not recommended unless you downsize your tires.

Around town mileage is somewhat lower, but, averaging better than 24 mpg in suburban driving. Only disappointment so far is air conditioning effectiveness - cooling is marginal in direct sun when over 90 degrees (perhaps due to untinted windows on base model).

"OK so im in the market for an suv with 6-7 seat i saw that the new highlander came out and decided to test drive, this is by the worst car i have test drove. Let  me start off when i left the lot to the main street i tried to punch it because it was and entrance to a highway and the car hesitate so bad its like it doesn't have the power my foot demand and it gets stuck in gear for long period of time it is as bad as the first version of nissan cvt transmission, from 1st to 2nd gear the car went to 3500 rpm and was there for a good 4 sec untill it finally changed to second this was the same thing from second to third and it shifted hard as if the transmission was slipping or something. As you doing a rolling stop and try to step on the gas there is a bad delay for the car to respond ,  its confused on what gear to go into and so  one time it went to a higher  gear and almost stalled. this is as bad as the hyundai santa fe issues if not worse, another thing i hated was the start and stop i know its new technology yea it saves fuel but its going to be harder on the engine and starter, but for toyota i give them an F for this system because as soon as you step off the gas it jerk the living **** out of you, i thought someone hit us  or something and the dealer guy was like thats the new system i just drove back and left cause that car it just horrible.      Some of you may think i dont know what im talking about but im a drag racer and only feel a car jerk like that either when some one hits you or when i gas it on my race car for a car like this highlander just to jerk you every time at light it bad eventually the jerking will ause the car to crack something in the unibody i know you can shut it off but still what the purpose of having it if does this. also to add to the car hesitation for a car with 295 it seems very weak the sorento has 280hp and its plenty powerful, even my dad old towncar is more powerful and it only has around 200hp and weighs 4000lbs. so please people think again if you want to buy these new highlander give them a through test drive and youll see what im talking about",neg
This is my 2nd Pilot. I went from the  2010 EX-L to the 2016 Elite and I love the navigation and all of the bells and whistles which are standard in the Elite. I can't speak of the reliability yet since I only own it for 2 weeks.,pos
I bought this vehicle based on having driven my sisters 2013 CRV. This is a very different vehicle. The transmission never engages. When I need to get in an acceleration lane and get up to speed it never takes hold. If you floor it it really confuses it and it starts to fluctuate up and down. I had a 2005 Honda pilot before this and I was ready to take a step down but the storage and fit and finish on this vehicle is not even in the same universe. The console and door storage are poorly thought out and are near useless. My pilot was the exact opposite. I know Honda is chasing good gas milage to compete but in  my opinion this was a big miss. I would go so far as to say this vehicle is dangerous if you are going to take it out in traffic.,neg
"I bought a 2017 Forester to replace my 2006 model.  The new one is a pleasure to drive.  The driver's seat and steering wheel can be adjusted in more ways, the interior is quieter, and the sound system is better.  My only complaint is that the right-rear blind spot is bad.  The rear-seat headrest on that side blocks the  view out of that corner.  Overall, I love the car.",pos
"Update:  I've owned the Forester for over 7 months now.  I still love the car.   The only slight negative I've noticed is that with the 23mpg and a 16 gallon gas tank.  I have to fill up a few more times a year as the range with my driving history on a full tank is under 400 miles.  

I had a 2009 Mazda 6 Grand Touring with a 6 speed stick because it was fun to drive.   The Forester XT is just as fun and I'm going to love driving in the snow.  So far, all my driving has been city and I'm avg about 23mpg.  Not too bad as I have a bit of a lead foot and a turbo.  The sport sharp mode is great fun and quick.  I really like the feel of this car on the road.  It's quiet and handles well.   The ride is surprisingly comfortable even compared to my wife's Legacy.   Turning into a parking spot is excellent compared to most cars I've driven (I travel quite a lot so drive many different types of rental cars).   I can't think of much I don't like.  There a few 'it would be nice' things; a bigger console, easier way to switch between radio and USB while driving, a little stiffer-feeling brake pedal (just feels a little soft after the Mazda).... that's about it.    I drove it in very heavy rain a  couple times where it plowed through 6 inches of water and kept me straight, really confident.   Eyesight (with adaptive cruise), lane assist, automatic braking, rear traffic detection are all really good reasons to buy the higher Subaru trims.   I'm very ok with the CVT (turbo XT gets a better transmission than 2.5 trims).  The CVT shifts fine, I like that I can set the cruise and it will slow me to the set speed going down fairly good hills without hitting the brakes.   I like to play with the paddle shifters once in a while just for fun.   I'm pretty sure if no one ever mentioned it had a CVT most people wouldn't actually notice.    I looked at the 2017 Outbacks but the Forester is much easier to get into and out of than the Outback.  It's got fantastic vision - you can see everything around you.",pos

"I lease a 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo E 4x4 which I've had for 11 months to the day. I only cross-shopped this vehicle with a Jeep Wrangler Unlimited, and settled on the Grand Cherokee after being truthful with myself about the amount of times I would be able to use the Wrangler to it's full potential. Before leasing the vehicle, I had heard of a few issues with the 2014 Grand Cherokee models, but could not find anything negative about the 2015s and assumed any kinks had been worked out.

I love this car for its exterior and interior styling. I have pretty much a base model car, but it comes with many standard creature comforts like the keyless enter and go, push button start, power seat, automatic dual zone climate control, etc. It also looks like a much more expensive vehicle.

I HATE this car for its cheap build quality and faulty electric systems. As soon as I drove the vehicle off the dealer's lot I noticed that the headlights flicker sometimes when the car is shifting. On several occasions my radio has completely shut off and restarted while I was driving, other times it has just simply shut off and does not reset until I restart the vehicle. I have also had my instrument cluster turn completely black while driving, which includes my speedometer.

Two days after getting home with the car I noticed that my seats were ripped at the seams in the second row and passenger seats where no one had sat before. This is a minor problem, but just an example of the cheap quality workmanship.

Roughly six months after buying the GC, I started hearing sloshing water in the driver's side dashboard. At first I attributed it to heavy rains the night before, but after continuously hearing the water and it progressively getting worse, I brought it to my local dealership. After several weeks of back and forth with them, they took the dashboard apart below the steering wheel and removed a 1/2 gallon of water; however, they were unable to identify the source of the water.

A few days ago, on a cold February morning, I heard a piece of ice slide across the dashboard as I turned corners. The water issue is back and is now freezing! Before being able to make an appointment to have this looked at, my entire climate system: heat, air conditioning, and defroster stopped working altogether today. The fan started blowing at full blast and then suddenly stopped and started to make a knocking noise. It wasn't a fun ride to the dealership on a 28 degree night.

I'm eagerly awaiting the resolution to this most recent instance of my reoccurring problem and will make every attempt in my power to just get rid of this vehicle ASAP. The beautiful aesthetics and interior finishes are not worth the headache and aggravation of being without a car once a month while it sits in the dealership and they scratch their heads looking at it.",neg

On my way to the dealer, the transmission started slipping and there was a squealing noise. I was terrified, and knew that it was the transmission. After 2 hours at the dealer, they determined that it was the transmission, and that they would need to order a part. It would take 3-4 days to get the part and fix the car. Yes, FIX THE CAR, that I had owned for 33 days, and had paid $45,000 for. I told them that I did not want the car, and that they needed to give me my money back. They offered $39,500. So, I was going to be out $5,500 for a defective vehicle. I demanded to speak with the manager. After nearly 6 hours at the dealer, with my two kids, the manager offered $44,000. In total I was out $1,300, but was too tired to fight. Chalk it up to lesson learned. I now have no car, a stained garage, am out $1,300 and have to start the car shopping process again.

The sound system and available options are plentiful and quality sounding. Navigation aid and mapping is nice. The USB and other component ports enable multi availability to other occupants. Very satisfied w the Forester.",pos
"Pros: roomy interior, good visibility, good brakes, adequate hwy acceleration, fuel economy meets epa estimates. CVT transmission works smoothly and quietly so far. Cons: Found out about the ongoing oil consumption problem when the salesman warned us after buying the car. With this information I was then able to specifically search for Subaru oil consumption issues...lots of people having problems. For some owners the oil consumption did not start until 20k-almost 40k miles. Not good. I'm watching the oil level closely. If a problem starts then this Forster will be down the road..deforested. The heater system is the coldest of any car we have ever owned. in summary my wife says it is a cold car, whereas her Toyota Highlander will cook you out of the car in a few miles. The dealership checked the heat system and said it is ok, but the temp and volume of airflow is truly lacking, thus takes a long engine warm up on cold days 10 degF or colder. Therefore so much for the partial zero emissions. The heater controls are very difficult to read, chrome knobs with a small square marker to identify what the setting is. The seats are stiff and take getting used to. The car has 70 series (wide) tires and skids easily on hardpack or icy roads. The Forester also gets stuck easily...6 inches of wind-drift in the driveway and have to resort to moving back and forth...whereas the Highlander (2002) works thru it with ease. Moving the Forster forward thru deeper snow, but not up to the belly of the car, the car starts to hop and shudder..the car barely keeps moving. The Highlander goes thru the same untracked snow with no problem. The car has a large windshield, no across the top window tint, and small sun visors that dont reach to the rear view mirror nor do they step up and over the mirror...thus on winter days with the sun at a low angle to the horizon, it shines in between the mirror and sun visor...no way to block it. When driving 800 miles to visit family at Christmas that became alot of sun in your eyes for hours on end. In summary, back in the 1960's the motto was owning a vehicle required putting up with a certain amount of hassle...I did not expect this with a 2016 vehicle. The on-going oil consumption problem, the poor heater, the poor winter traction all combine to reach a poor review.",neg

"It is a little early to rate this Forester but it is a huge upgrade from my 2004 model. I am hoping that the interior is more durable than my other one. The cloth/vinyl combo may split. I will see if they improved. I also looked at the Nissan Rogue and Toyota Rav4. If visibility matters, the Forester has it all over these other SUVs. However, I like the material of the seats in the Rogue more. The back up camera in the 2016 Forester is much better than the 15's. It has a larger area for hauling than the other models too without getting into a bigger sized SUV.",pos
"I have driven my Summit through blizzards, snow covered roads, roads that were covered in deep water and never has it let me down. I drive around 35k miles a year in the Jeep and the only maintenance other than oil changes, I have ever had to do is replace a sensor. The styling is great, I can tow things with it, the ergonomics are the best in any vehicle I have ever been in. My only complaint is the gas mileage. I own the Penstar V6 and it should get 17 MPG City 24 Highway, but though 95% of my miles are highway I only average 17.5 mpg. Far short of the 24 that is advertised. Though I do drive 5 MPH over the speed-limit so generally at 75 MPH.",pos

Adaptive cruise control follows the car ahead, slowing down when it does and speeding back up to the set value when the way is clear. Lane assist will actually move you back into the lane if you drift without signaling. There are too many features to describe! It's kind of like I got a car that will backseat drive my husband for me when I'm not in the car...

No confidence. The engine has many flat spots when accelerating, or when you move forward after a stop. The transmission is still thinking..... I had a whirling noise in my engine that Jeep could NEVER fix. I brought it to them two or three times complaining of the same thing. Customer service was almost as bad as Subaru. Rude, condescending managers that have so many vehicles in line to be worked on that they forgot they gave me a loaner car. Forgot.",neg
"Friend bought a 2006 GC brand new that I fell in love with. It was a basic model but did have the 4x4 and towing packages. 9 years later and now that I could afford one, I bought a 2015. I wish I would have had the opportunity and had at least a two day test drive period. First of all Fiat has cheapened the exterior by eliminating the dual exhausts and adding that ugly plastic trim along the bottom. Next the Uconnect  is a nightmare especially since the heated seats and other options aren't controlled by a physical knob. The dash squeaks so I know as my Jeep ages these squeaks will become really annoying. The steering wheel is too thick, your hands become sore after a long drive. Even with the lumbar and other seat controls, your back is sore after two or more hours of constant driving.  Cheap interior trim and my leather seats are starting to crack in the FL heat and humidity.  The dealer just repaired my transmission.... others have had the same problem... and now the A/C compressor is bad. It keeps recycling every 15 seconds as if there is not enough refrigerant in the system. Anyone who is really serious about buying this model or other Chrysler Fiat models, read the Consumer Report reviews. You'll change your mind in an instant.

"This 2015 Subaru Forester was my first new vehicle in 12 years. I did my research and test drove a lot of other vehicles before choosing it. Everything was fine until the oil light came on before the first scheduled service. I checked the oil and it was a quart down. I put a quart of oil in and mentioned it when I took the car in for service. The maintenance person I spoke to was completely mystified as to what could be wrong. I have had the car a little over a year and a half and have had to put oil in it three times. The dealership has had me coming back every 1200 miles to do oil consumption test ""to see what could be wrong"". Three weeks ago I got a settlement notice of a class action suit against Subaru for excessive oil consumption in the 2014 and 2015 Foresters. So, all along the service people must have known what was happening and I can only assume that they were told to lie about it. I like the car, it's fun to drive, but I really resent being treated like an idiot by the dealership I will never buy another Subaru. In my opinion they are completely unreliable.
Update as of June 2017:  The dealership replaced the engine in my Forester in September of 2016 after I sent in a very negative survey to Subaru corporate. It came out that the design of the engine I had allowed synthetic oil to leak around the seals, thus explaining the low oil levels. Since replacing the engine is an expensive fix, that is why the dealership didn't want to admit there was a problem. Since the engine was replaced the car has been burning oil normally and I've gotten to a place where I think I can stand to keep the car. I will not, however, ever buy another Subaru. Trust lost often can never be earned back.",neg

"I've had my 2015 Forester for almost an entire year now and I'm at 17,000 miles. When I was shopping for a new vehicle, I didn't even consider Subaru. The day I went test driving all of the vehicles that were on my list, I was highly unsatisfied with everything that had happened at other dealerships, and on a whim, my parents were like ""WELL LETS CHECK OUT SUBARU!!!"" 

The knowledgeable sales people, warm environment, and the ""quality you could feel"" with the Forester is what sold me. The giant glass sunroof is also an extra perk. During the winter months, I made it EVERYWHERE with complete confidence. And I even tested out X-Mode on my friends extremely snow-covered driveway.....it works flawlessly. Highway MPG is also fantastic. I average 32-35. I highly recommend this vehicle or any Subaru. They have a feeling like non other. So far, no complaints.




Updated Review: I ended up trading my Forester for a 2017 Subaru Outback 3.6R. Nothing against the Forester....They fulfill their intented purpose flawlessly. However, I wanted a vehicle with a better ride, handling, and more powerful engine.",pos
They are a good reliable suv that is great with driving around a group of grandkids,pos
I purchased the 17 Highlander xle for my wife and the dealer has had the vehicle and put more miles on it than we have .  It had a vibration and noise coming from the front end when making left turns . I was called into the dealer 3 different times to recreate the noise for them .  The part they said was no good had to be ordered from Japan and they couldn't give me an eta .  22 days later still no word .   I would wait until they get parts issues handled before you purchase this car .  Interior quality is great but I wouldn't know because I had the car for 5 days before I took it back,neg
"I'm a fan of CR-V But this is not for anyone
This car is full of errors
Vibrates at every traffic light
It's totally noisy. what is it with Honda??",neg
"Bought a 2015 CR-V new less than a week ago. For the first few days it was a perfect car, then it started vibrating horribly at idle when in drive. Apparently this a known issue (just search the internet, Honda even has a video about it) that the ""reputable"" car rating websites chose to ignore when giving the car five star ratings. Don't be tricked into buying this car.",neg
"I deeply regret purchasing the V6 4x4 Trailhawk 2015 Jeep.  After 2200 miles, the transmission is broken.  While driving on the interstate the check engine light came on, so we exited the interstate.  A service transmission message was displayed on the screen.  Upon stopping at the exit ramp light, the car would not move forward, although it was in drive.  The problem repeated again, one block away from the dealership where we took it for repair.  The car simply stops in traffic with little to no warning.  Prior to the sudden onset of this transmission problem, we had no issues with the vehicle.  When we arrived at the dealership, they indicated it would be at least a week before the transmission techs could even look at the vehicle as there is a glut of service inventory for transmission repairs.  After they look at the vehicle to get the specific failure code, we would then have to wait for our turn for repair as they are backlogged for transmission repairs.  We asked that they call other dealerships and find out if they can service it sooner, and every dealership within 75 miles is booked out WEEK(S) ahead for transmission repairs.  We looked up this model vehicle online and searched specifically for transmission failures, and our hearts sunk.  Many (hundreds of people) claim to be having what appears to be the same issue at very similar mileage (less than 6500 miles) on the Cherokee 9 speed transmissions.  We are disgusted with this purchase and the customer service we have experienced from Jeep.  I emailed Chrysler, per the instructions in the owner's manual, and have not received a response.  I have called the customer care department and have not received any support.  Jeep will not give us a loaner vehicle to use while they repair our brand new Trailhawk with 2200 miles on it that we paid $41k for.  I know these vehicles are visually appealing, have comfortable seating, have good acceleration and performance specs, but seriously, no car should have transmission failures at 2200 miles.  If you are still considering purchasing this vehicle after reading my review, I strongly urge you to spend a few minutes on the web searching car complaint sites for issues with the Cherokee transmission.  I deeply regret this purchase and would advise any friend or family member to purchase something different, based on this experience.  We have been without our brand new Jeep for some time now, the dealer has not contacted us, Jeep has not responded to our inquiries, Chrysler has not responded, and there appears to be no end in sight.  I would never purchase this vehicle again under any circumstance, despite how much we love the appearance and comfort.",neg
we bought the car a week ago so very early review we had a 10 Avalon for over 7 years my wife wanted an suv looked at so many brands the mid sized and full size suv drove like a truck to her didnt care for that but all the compact suv had 4 cylinders didnt care for that then we found the Cherokee overland v6 power and plush as a bmw try one!,pos
"We have only had the car for about 1,000 miles, so some questions don't apply.  Overall, we are very happy with the purchase.",pos
"We traded in our 2011 Honda Pilot, and went for the top of the line this time. While the interior and amenities are very nice, they don't make up for the problems with the transmission.  Two months after purchasing the car we noticed a whining sound while accelerating. Took them 2 months and me being very insistent on getting a fix, which was a new wiring harness. Recently the vehicle started having transmission problems, similar to other reviews. Transmission was glitchy, lurching, missing gears, this was most notable when climbing a hill. The vehicle then started with some sort of belt squeaking noise, engine then started overheating while idling. Back to Honda Service....""somehow"" transmission fluid had gotten into the radiator, and the Honda service verified the transmission problem, the fix replacing the entire transmission. Found out at the Honda Service desk that they had to replace a transmission on another Elite just a few weeks before mine. After doing extensive research on this 9 speed transmission, it seems this transmission is not reliable. I too like other Elite owners, am EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED WITH HONDA. Why would they put this transmission in their most expensive vehicle? I have called American Honda to open a case, with the hopes of getting out of this car and into a Pilot EX-L with the tried and true 6 speed transmission. Of course the dealer with ""let"" me trade my car in and accomplish this, and then I can loose twelve grand. SHAME ON YOU HONDA!!!
Thank Goodness we were able to get out of this car...Went to an Acura dealer this December and they helped us dump this lemon of a car..I'm in an ACURA RDX and love it...this is what a car should do when you bring it home:)",neg

My Highlander is the top of the line with every option. It is very lux and actually an easy replacement for my previous SUV a BMW X5. It is lighter by 1000 lbs and has 45 fewer bhp.

We still love our new Pilot!,pos
"Let me start with saying that I’m a Mazda guy. I owned 8 Mazda in 15 year period. My wife drives 2016 CX-5 GT model and we love that car. I had 2011 CX-9 GT with to many miles, so it was a time to get a new car. Went to Mazda to see what I can get for cheap, like $250-$300 per month lease. Liked the new 2017 CX-9, but it was to expensive. Then my brother told me that Subaru has cheap lease specials. Same day went to see what will I like. I liked the Outback but it was to slow with 2.5i engine option. Outback is much heavier then Forester. So I end it up leasing 2017 Forester because the cheap lease special ($250 per month tax included.  $400 down) and the way it drives. This is my second Subaru. The first was 2007 Impresa 2.5i. I loved that car. Drove 95K miles with zero problems, that’s why I decided to get Forester. So far I’m very satisfied. Good acceleration, good MPG for AWD, very comfortable seats. AWD is a big plus. Good handling, very nice and quiet ride.  I love all the safety futures, lane assistance, blind spot monitor and break assist. New entertainment system is awesome; 7” touch screen is very easy to use. Backup camera is OK, low quality when it’s dark. The only concern I have is the towing capacity only 1500lb. I have a trailer with 3 dirt bikes on it. Total weight is 1400lb, so I should be OK I hope))) I drove both 2016 and 2017 Forester. 2017 has a better CVT transition (more responsive), less road/wind noise, better interior and looks meaner))). Over all I enjoy driving this car.",pos
"My (top-of-the-line)  2015 CR-V which I purchase on July 22, 2015 has an engine that is malfunctioning.  It frequently and unexpectedly fails to accelerate when the accelerator is depressed.  In fact, the vehicle stalls/slows down during these occurrences.  Getting through intersections and merging with traffic can get real exciting. These failures have been witnessed by as many as three licensed drivers.  A Honda dealership has done two diagnostic test and driving test and can not replicate the condition.  The dealership and American Honda Motors express they can not repair a vehicle if they cannot identify the problem.  My question is if their technician is riding in the car and the acceleration fails how will they identify the cause especially when their diagnostic equipment does not identify the failure(s).  At this time, both the dealership and American Honda Motors tells me there is nothing they can do for the malfunctioning car they made.  This leaves me with a $40,000 piece of junk (in my opinion).  A car for which I am paying over $40,000 and it is unsafe to drive.",neg
"I was so excited to get my 2014 Grand Cherokee limited. When I picked it up, it was great. It drove very well - I stayed with the V6 rather than upgrading. It was comfortable, and just all around everything I hoped. The Tech features are very cool, they take a little time to become familiar with all of the options though. After a few days of driving it, I was on the highway when it had an issue. First the instrument cluster stopped working, then it would not accelerate. The engine whined pretty loudly, then the whole car shut down, and I coasted for a few second. It came back on, and accelerated quickly. Luckily, there was nobody right in front of me. As of today, the Grand Cherokee is in the shop for the third time, all similar issues. The dealer has tried replacing the catalytic converter and the oxygen sensors... I'll see what they come up with this time. Chrysler's customer service so far has not been much help at all.",neg

"My problem started in May 2015 with approximately 30000 on the car. The car didn't want to accelerate when first starting. When stepping on the gas the vehicle lurched forward. I took it in to Subaru three times and they told me this was normal with their CVT transmissions. Finally at about 40000 I took it in a fourth time and I'm told I have a failed transmission. this was based on anise they heard coming from the engine. Subarus exact words and what is written on my diagnosis. I'm no mechanic but that makes no sense to me. They gave me an estimate of approximately $9,000 to repair. The vehicle has a 60k power train warranty. You would think Subaru would replace it under warranty. Nope. They are trying to not honor my warranty and stick me with the bill. I have had nothing but problems with this vehicle and with Subaru customer service. I told Subaru I didn't feel safe driving this vehicle with my three year old child. Subaru offered to reimburse my $30 per day for 5 days of s rental vehicle. My five days are up and I have yet to receive any response from Subaru Corp. Unacceptable Subaru!",neg

My wife and I are the ones who refuse to get a mini van (family of 4..hoping 5)....and after extensive research we decided on a HONDA PILOT LX. We didnt need anything too fancy. We wanted 1. Reliable 2. Comfort. 3. Spacious. So far so good - I test drove many in the mid size SUV and HONDA PILOT won. The mid size SUV feels like a car - steering is extremely easy/non stiff for a mid size. Comfort is great / the extra space in the back makes a difference. We looked at Kia Sorento and Hy Sante Fe...liked both of them but Pilot seemed a hair smoother on the ride / more spacious 3rd / more cargo space. And we got it for under MSRP! We couldnt be happier with our Honda purchase...time will tell if it holds the Honda name and last over 10 years (My old ford explorer in the past did not!!),pos
"Very comfortable crossover with nice interior. I am 6'4"" and have plenty of room in the drivers seat. The standard safety features include dynamic cruise control, lane departure warning, rear cross traffic warning and pedestrian warning all work well and enhance the safety of the vehicle. Start-stop function is smooth and responsive and can be disabled if the driver does not want the added fuel savings. New 6 cylinder engine with 8 speed transmission proved sufficient power and smooth acceleration. The third row seating is limited and can only be used for adults during short trips or kids. Quality interior and exterior fit and finish.",pos
"I love Hondas. Have had a few. Was excited to purchase the 2016 Honda Pilot. We have had the Honda for 1 year and 2 months..it has approximately 19thousand miles. Unfortunately, as the time increases things are starting to break. The passenger windows have had problems going back up...once down it may take several minutes to get the windows to roll up. The dealership is going to replace some parts and hope this will allow them to work again. The  second row Passenger seat broke and was unable to move forward or back..the dealership fixed and I hope the other seats do not have problems. The biggest problem is the transmission. The engine started to make a chirping noise about 2 weeks ago when shifting into 4th gear or when you got to about 10/15 miles. I took it in to find out that it is unable to drive and will take 2 weeks to repair because it needs a new transmission.  I find it a little scary after researching on the web that this is a common problem. I contacted the dealership where I purchased the car to express my concern. They suggested I call Honda directly. I have done this and now have a case file and they are to contact me tomorrow. With 3 kids and reading a lot of reviews of transmission problems and brake problems will admit am a little scared to drive once they fix. How do I know that this will not happen again or something else? I can't get over the fact that it has only 19 thousand miles and only about a year old. My husband is ready to trade the car in and call it a loss. Recommend doing a bunch of research before purchasing this type vehicle.",neg

So, would i recommend this to anyone yes to everyone especially if you have a family. We are just a small family of 3 but, we have a dog so we wanted something big enough to separate the baby and the dog.

"Solid car, not a sports car, but acceleration is ok.  Took a 1100 mile trip, drove in hard rain and winds for 2/3 of the distance and handled both well.  Traded in a 2011 Avalon, so had to adjust to stiffer ride and a little more noise. 
Still happy with the car, had a tire blow out at 75 on the right rear, hit some construction trash, but was able to pull off on shoulder with no problems.  Only problem, in remote Texas late at night,  road service is severely limited, had to drive on donut spare for about 150 miles at very slow speed.

Over the next 2 months new transmission and new axel on front driver and passenger sides. 3 software updates for the transmission and still  shifting horrible. Looked up lemon law rules for my state and followed them. No attorney and 6 months later they bought it back. They have no choice but to if they haven't fixed it after 4 tries. Send certified letter to corporate giving them one more try to fix it and if they don't BUY BACK TIME.  Call your state's consumer protection department and they will help get you on track. They paid retail price of the vehicle plus registration, tax,doc fee,warranty fees, gap that didn't get refunded to me as well as any accessories I put on the jeep. I also got ALL the interest in paid above everything else which if you figure half your payments go toward interest at the start of the loan so was nice.

"Knowing what I know now, I have complete buyers remorse.  It does not hold its value.  It's a complete rip off.  Toyota Finance is a complete rip off.  They need to realize the true facts about their American made ford parts being assemble in Mexico is false advertisement.  I have a Toyota body, with who knows how many cheap parts are used.  I will never by a Toyota again, the sad thing is who would want to by any highlanders, the trade in value doesn't come close to being the amount it should be.  Complete buyers remorse.  Stay away from Toyota's.  Buy a Ford, It is American, by a Chevy it is American.  But if I were to by an European car.  It will be a true European Car.   Not happy about the true facts about Toyota after the purchase.  Lesson Learned.  I would come out a whole lot better if I turned the car in due to not holding their value for the price you will pay.  Not to mention, Toyota Finance is repo happy, I think the reason is they want to make payments teetering on the edge of way too high so people default.   I say let them have it if they won't work with you and be reasonable...After all the parts are not Toyota parts.  They are assembled in different places in the US, but mostly Mexico.  So there you have it, the absolute truth about Toyota and their high repo problem with Toyota Finance.  If you still want one after reading this statement of fact.  Do not use Toyota Finance, they are prideful of the millions of 2015-16 repo action.

I bought  a 2015 Honda Crv.  A few days after i had it i relized that it has a vibration and idle problem when stopping at red lights.  I very seldom drive the car because it vibrates so bad.So i am paying on this car and Honda hasnt did anything about the problem.

"2017 and the first month was great..then came the rain. A puddle of water on passenger side floor. Of course we brought it back to the dealer and wanted it fixed and get things replaced and wanted to know what's going on. Well to our surprise they tell us the air conditioner is blocked and that is causing it. Well I don't know how that can cause a puddle that goes above the floor mat. What the heck how can that be it's bran new. We have owned multiple cars and none have had issue like this.  Not sure about Subaru's quality anymore...

So after much back and forth with the dealership over the phone, and many trips there as well, it all came down to a plugged drain line for the air conditioner which of course they fix and then cleaned the carpet. They gave us a nice gift and upgraded our warranty. Lets see how well the floor pan holds up over the next couple of years.",neg
"First of all, I am writing this review keeping in mind its for a CUV and not a sports car.

A traded a 2010 Honda CR-V for my 2016 Forester 2.5i. I also test drove a Honda CR-V, HR-V, and many Subaru models and trims

Since I already own a sporty car, my purpose for buying the Forester was practicality.

My reasons for picking and loving the Forester over other choices:
- Quality of material are superior. The seat fabric feels better and more durable than on the CR-V. The plastic trim feels really nice and is soft-touch in most places. The switch gear (knobs) are very solid. The doors, door panels and seat frame are solid.
- The 2.5 boxer engine and CVT provide much better acceleration than my old CR-V. Its on par with the new CR-V but it handles better.
- Visibility is outstanding. I feel much safer being able to see around me so well 360 degrees. Most CUVs have poorer visibility.
- Subaru AWD is best in class. The OEM tires are mediocre, but that is true of most OEM tires.
- Storage space is excellent - on par with the CR-V.
- Cabin tech is much better than I was used to. I paired both my wife's and my iPhones. You can set it up to automatically connect to either phone when do so manually when the car starts. I use Apple Music and have steering wheel control of Apple Radio, playlists, albums, etc. Pandora integration is also excellent. It all works over BT or over USB - your choice.
- Handling is better than I expected. I drive a very rough, windy road for a few miles each day. The suspension tracks very well and inspires confidence.
- MPG is very good. I used to average 24.5 mpg with my 2010 CR-V. In the first 1000 miles I average 28.5 mpg with the Forester. I expect that to get better after break-in, with warmer weather and summer gas.
- My dealer was great. I asked them if I could get heated seats added to the base model. They took care of getting them installed (after-market). Considering the Subaru's TMV and my trade, they didn't charge me anything for the upgrade.

And a few cons:
- With the base Forester I got manual seats. I wish they were more adjustable.
- Subaru could have provided more storage nooks in the dash

Considering the passenger volume, cargo volume, great CUV mileage, and quality, the Forester is a steal.",pos
"First of all after purchasing this car I feel like the stupidest person alive. I assumed there would be a spare tire or at least a donut which there is none, all you get is a tire pump filled with a one time use sealant where the spare should be. You think i would've checked before buying. The Uconnect voice commands only understand you 5% of the time, worthless. I purchased the Lifetime Warranty, which i assumed would be forever as long as I'm in ownership of the vehicle and breathing. This is not the case the Lifetime warranty becomes void as soon as the repair cost becomes more than the vehicles value at the time, I figure 10-12 years according to what i see on Blue Book Values, not to mention deductibles on warranty repairs which greatly affects warranty price. Last but not least, bring a calculator with you on any new car purchase and take the time to recalculate the dealers figures, mine offered me $1000 trade-in on my hunk of junk without even seeing it, which now that i think about it. He probably gave me nothing and made it seem like he did. Live and learn. I have only owned this for 3 days, so i don't know very much on performance and reliability, but from what I've seen so far, I think i'm in for a very bumpy road ahead. My first choice was a 2016 Hyundai Tucson, should've went back.",neg

This will make 2 weeks my wife has had to ride on this cheap spare...not really comfortable with that. They choose a tire that NO ONE carries, dealers or locally. Seriously no one can get tires for this vehicle without ordering. Our dealer Moss Motors has been less than helpful, not even bothering to return a call as promised. Come on Honda!

"I purchased a 2015 Highlander Limited on September 30, 2015-I absolutely loved the vehicle.  This vehicle was a replacement for my 2003 Highlander in which I logged over 180,000 satisfied miles.  It was amazing how far this vehicle has come since then with regards to design and features.  The new vehicle was extremely luxurious and had exceptional driving ability. 
On October 20, 2015 I was taking my three boys to soccer practice (ages 6,7 and 11) when I was hit head-on by a drunk driver in a 25 mph zone five minutes from our home.  The driver of the other vehicle, who was travelling at 87 mph and managed to slow to 70 mph before striking me in the front driver side, was killed instantly.  Me and my three children were able to exit the vehicle and walk away!  This is true and real -world testament to the Toyota Highlander's quality and safety.  The Glassboro Police Department (assigned to investigate the crash,was impressed with the construction of the vehicle and how it held up under such extreme conditions and force.  It is my understanding that the Chief of Police actually wrote a letter to Toyota as a testimonial to the vehicles safety features.  He actually had a small quote in one of the numerous articles attesting to how well the vehicle withstood the collision.  
Needless to say that as soon as I was able to, I walked into Toyota of Turnersville and purchased the exact same vehicle, only a different color-slight superstition.  My children love our Highlander and refer to it as the ""safe car.""  This car is definitely top of the line in its' segment across the board.  Please keep in mind, the price is relatively high (comparable to some ""luxury"" SUVs) and there is comparatively less wiggle room with the price; however, you get what you pay for with this vehicle.

"We bought our eighth -- and last -- new Honda in March 2015. We drove the CRV-EX AWD just 1,600 miles before trading it for a 2015 RAV4 because we experienced unexpected acceleration on several occasions and received no help from Honda. I was stunned. I couldn't believe how a longtime loyal Honda owner could be treated so poorly by Airport Honda in Tennessee and American Honda. I wanted American Honda to buy it back and told the representative that I would gladly pay for the mileage.

Here's what happened: I took the car to Airport Honda on Aug. 26 so they could check it out. Since the problem was intermittent, I halfway expected that they wouldn't find a problem, especially given the way they treated me upon arrival. Despite showing them Internet reports of unexpected acceleration in CR-Vs, they said that they had never heard of such a problem. I explained that there's no way I would make this up since it caused me a lot of trouble taking off work and driving 40 miles (round trip) so they could see if they could ""replicate"" (wink, wink) the problem. The best I could get was a car that functioned properly. After keeping the car for two days, of course they told me the car was fine.

So when it became obvious that the service department was of no use, I tried to trade the car for either a 2016 Pilot or another CR-V, although that prospect scared me somewhat because I didn't know if I could trust another CR-V. They said they'd call me with a trade figure, but they never did as they obviously didn't want the absolutely pristine gray CR-V with the added $500 options of a hood deflector, mud flaps and a sunroof visor -- all genuine Honda parts installed by Airport Honda. I called them back and spoke to Bruce Wayne (no kidding), and he wouldn't provide a trade figure many hours after he said they'd have those numbers in a few minutes.

In the end, I lost several thousand dollars and all respect I had for American Honda and Airport Honda. Our RAV4 with a conventional six-speed transmission is rock solid and the dealer, Fox Toyota, is perhaps the most honest and best in America. Reports of Honda's decline certainly don't seem to be exaggerated based on my experience. Oh, and I forgot to mention how the CR-V's engine sent vibrations through the cabin with the car in drive and the brake pedal depressed. Airport Honda acknowledged that problem but said there isn't a fix at this time. Anyway, I just hope no one gets killed in a CR-V when it takes off.

Many months later, nothing has changed. Honda is an arrogant embarrassment.",neg
"This is my 4th 4 x 4 vehicle. I bought this planning to keep for 6 years. In less than 1 year Transmission already broke 3 times and there is always something wrong; ABS, engine light As bad has the car is the service. But it makes sense, every-time I go to the dealer, someone is complaining about their Jeep and takes more than One week to make an appointment . Jeep... Never again.",neg
I loved every one of my Foresters.  Subaru is a company that puts quality and safety and clean air above profits.  The service I received at dealerships has always been done as scheduled with no unpleasant surprises.  They make it easy to stay loyal to the Subaru brand.,pos
"For the first time since 1979 I bought a new car just for me. The car I have been dreaming about for years a Subaru. I knew how safe Subaru was, I just never thought I would own one so soon. I love the ride, and all the safety features. My salesman was great and very patient with as I tried to decide what color, options, when to actually buy it.",pos
"I really liked everything about the 2017 CRV, materials, comfort, safety features etc.  That was until I did a test drive.  On the street it felt heavy and somewhat underpowered.  On the freeway, it was really bad.  The midrange power and torque is really inadequate.  If I wanted to speed up, I would press the accelerator and the SUV would start to accelerate but then the CVT ""upshifted a gear"".  I would then have to press the gas pedal further but the same problem would recur again and again.  There is no sport mode to make the CVT hold a ""gear"".  This was really bad.  The sales person also admitted that there's always a delay with the CVT which is then aggravated by turbo lag plus the CVT always moving ""up a gear"" making the engine bog down.  Great for mileage, bad for driving.  My driving is between Los Angeles and Las Vegas, as well as Los Angeles to Mammoth, so there are hills, steep grades and passing.  So this SUV is not suitable for my driving conditions and style.",neg
"I wanted a Subaru because they have a great rating. When I test drove it, I loved it.  This car handles impressively. This model has many great features such as heated seat, remote start, navigation,and eyesight. I had no issue with it in the snow last night. It is a quiet ride. I have not learned what everything does because I am still learning all about it. I discover something new everyday about it. I have nothing but good things to say about it.  Very nice car.",pos
"I spent weeks checking comparing and driving about 6 different SUVs. We finally narrowed it down to the CR-V, Sportage and the Ford Escape. The Honda won out because we liked the fit and the way it drives and handles. I drive almost 65 miles a day and so far am getting about 29 mpg.. First road tip coming in August to Dallas Georgia so well see how it goes..",pos
"Never thought I would ever say Do not buy the Honda Pilot, but I must. Frequent, but random ""Hard Shift"" issues with the transmission. 3 times to the dealer and no solution.

There is a big issue with this car. Still not resolved.. Stay away till they figure out there problem.",neg
"Have my 2015 Chrokee for a year and a half. Always in the shop. Dashboard is like a Christmas tree. Dealers don't know how to fix it. Chrysler will not exchange car.

"As many have mentioned before, this 2015 CR-V EX-L is also plagued by the vibration issues.

The sales person never mentioned this issue (of course) and I never felt it while test driving the car. I also missed the terrible sounding radio. I didn't care too much about the infotainment interface the, and I abhor it now.

Navigation only works if you have the app + cable and phone Honda wants you to use.

Overall not happy with the purchase. It is starting to deliver on the promise of better fuel consumption but the vibration issues make me wonder about the long term reliability of this vehicle.

I would encourage others who are shopping for this vehicle to be forward and ask the sales people about the vibration issues and shop elsewhere.

I would return this vehicle in a heartbeat.",neg

My past experience with Honda and the fact a comparably equipped XT5 would have cost me $15,000 more than the Elite, made my purchase a no-brainer.  The ride, quietness,and safety features are superb!",pos
"I've put 200 miles on this vehicle and hate it. It beeps at me all the time and usually I have no idea why. Sensing system goes into error. Dash tells me to BRAKE and more BEEPING when there is nobody near me on the freeway. Fancy iPad mounted to the dash blows. The vehicle is always locked when I think it's unlocked and unlocked when I think it's locked. The locks are downright infuriating. The fab weighs about 10 pounds in your pocket. Engine is loud and s l o w. Cab is horribly loud in the rain. Thought I needed to bond with her and spent the last two days dolling her up. It made me hate the vehicle even more. It's a detailing nightmare with so many water retaining nooks and crannies. Water gets inside the tail lights. Chrome trim pieces in the headlights grab my wash mit because they are poking out at the ends. Oh, and you have to leave your fab well away from the car when washing otherwise it keeps locking the doors and beeping every time the water hits the door handles. I hate this vehicle!

Update 03-04-2018: 2 months ownership, 842 miles driven on it, no regrets about anything my previous review said. My CRV has officially been named Spawn of Satan (SOS). I especially enjoyed the 4-week insect infestation on the EXTERIOR of the vehicle. 10s of thousands of the smallest jumping insects I have ever seen. Corporate Honda did not care; dealer had no clue what to do. Best guess is that it was sold to me with a nest in it somewhere. Every ""safety"" feature that can be disabled, except for blind spot warning, has been turned off because they flat out don't work. Unfortunately, the Honda Sensing system cannot be disabled. It's not ready for market. Count on plenty of temper tantrums from the system in anything less than perfect road conditions or weather. 

A few adds to my list of dislikes...The left 2-3 inches of the front windshield becomes unusable in the rain. You cannot stuff the center storage console with stuff AND expect to use the power/USB ports. There are no lights on the joysticks. When using turn signals you can EASILY accidentally turn on high beams. If you own it, you know these things. Regardless of an obscene amount of gasketing on this vehicle, there is still a moisture issue as evidenced by inside foggy windows every time the car is washed or in rain. 

This vehicle very surprisingly topped my most despised vehicle ever owned list in about a week. It took out long standing champ '89 Chevy Beretta which GM bought back from me under lemon law. Not in a million years would I expect a Honda to do that! I want to be clear that this vehicle has had NO mechanical problems that have left me stranded.  It's the rest of it that is absolutely sub-par.  This CRV replaces a 10-year old similar size and trim level SUV with an American badge. The bar to beat didn't seem very high, but I guess it was.",neg
Great buy! Nice amenities at a great value. We are extremely happy with the purchase!,pos
"This car is well thought out size & space wise. The ride& handling is quite good. Interior is well thought out both size & layout of controls.

No issues after 1 year of ownership. However getting in and out of the 3rd row seat is very bad. 3rd row usage limited but then again this is no mini van.,pos
"I had a Dodge Durango for a few years and since it was almost out of its extended warranty I figured get a new Jeep.  What a mistake that was.  After owning for only two weeks the car spent 11 days at a dealer for the following problems:  Faulty paint on the spoiler, Extreme wind noise, clunk noise when going over speed bumps, clothing hanger loose & rattling.   They repainted the spoiler, replaced the two front door rubber seals, a front & rear shocks were leaking so they replaced the front shock (rear shock is on extreme backorder, whatever that means because no one knows), replaced clothes hanger.  Well, after 11 days at the dealer, the wind noise issue is not resolved as once I hit 50+ miles per hour, I can't hear anything inside the car and the clunk noise when going speed bumps is still there.  I even made sure that the technician had driven over a bump to ensure the problem was actually the leaking shock.  I'm not sure how he couldn't hear the clunk as it's as loud as it can be.  So, now I have to go back to the dealer and leave my car for God knows how many more days there.  Now the headrests on both seats have started rattling every time going over rough road.  I haven't even made my first payment yet and I'm already disgusted with the car.

Update:  took the vehicle back to the dealer.  It sat there for another 5 days (now total of 16 days at dealer).  Apparently it were the two front shocks leaking & not the rear, bad communication from the service adviser.  They replaced the second front shock.  Clunk noise is still there.  Technician couldn't replicate the wind noise, so we took a ride and then he heard how loud it was and agreed it wasn't normal.  Next step is to wait for a Chrysler representative to come out, test drive the car and do a cabin pressurizing test to see where the air is leaking from (I'm not sure how you can pressurize a cabin when there are so many vents located all over).  This keeps getting better and better.

2nd Update:  Vehicle back at the dealer.  The clunk noise is still there.  Took a ride with the technician and went over small bumps at about 5 miles per hour and you could hear the noise.  His suggestion: driver over them slower!!!!!!!!!! I suggested maybe I should get out of the car & push it over the speed bump.  After all aren't Jeeps suppose to be off-road vehicles and yet they can't handle a small shopping center speed bump.  The wind noise still there, apparently the technician made the whole thing up about a Chrysler representative coming out and doing the whole pressurizing the cabin thing, because according to the service manger that never happens and Chrysler reps never come out.  So, now I'm back in my cheap piece of junk, dirty loaner car for the 3rd time this month, crossing my fingers that they will actually fix these problems on a car that I paid well over $40k for.",neg
"Loved this 2015 JEEP Cherokee Trailhawk for the first few months, then the recalls started to roll in. Oh, and still going to the dealership for the same recall fix (tomorrow will be the third time getting the back liftgate fixed, that won't latch/lock). 

Even though I went in under the warranty/recall to get things fixed, and they weren't fixed properly, so I'm back in Service Dept – now that I'm out of the warranty. they won't give me a rental car (not the dealership, not JEEP)! 

New favorite issue with the JEEP is when I'm sitting at a light and it's about to shut off because it's not getting enough gas perhaps. You guessed it, another fix that I already brought to the dealership to get done. Round 2 tomorrow.

Our JEEP from the 1990s is running better than this POS.  Not buying another (new) JEEP.",neg
"My car runs out of oil between oil changes. The dealer did an oil consumption test and told me I should be checking oil like they did in the old days, when pumping gas at each fill up.  I run synthetic oil so I go between 6,000-7,000 miles between changes. Twice I have run out of oil after 5,000 miles.  The first time I thought it was an error during the oil change. The next time I knew it was the car. The good news is I don't have to dispose of used oil... there isn't any. My husband drives a Chevy truck with over 100,000 miles and has never had to add oil. My boss bought two Kia's and they both have over 100,000 miles, no issues.  My car has had break issues at 60,000 miles, front and back washer pumps replaced. Front axle replaced. Seat belt recall. Timing belt cover had a hole in it, had to pull engine. Now it drinks oil ... a lot. All of this before 100,000 miles. I have owned Subaru's for over 30 years. This will be my last.",neg
"We replaced our 2006 Highlander about a month ago. Actually we kept it also we liked it so much. 
The new Highlander is fabulous. Super comfortable. Great acceleration. Very solid tight ride. Spacious interior. Great for long trips which we take often. CR gives it it's highest rating for a reason.
Some of the items above were given an ok or N/A rating because we haven't had the car long enough, except the navigation which actually is just OK. This seems to be the case on many of the built in systems.",pos
"It handles very well and has a smooth ride. I also like the safety features like brake warning, blind spot warning, to name a couple. With this turbo engine, some people have had a problem with excessive fuel getting into the oil. I have not. I am keeping a watch on it, but for now its not an issue for me. Having been a long time Honda owner, I feel a fix will be coming for those with the issue. The only very minor complaint I have is the black carpet. Every little bit of dirt shows. I would prefer the gray, but no longer available. Highly recommend.",pos
"This car has probably got the greatest turning radius of any vehicle I've ever been in...it practically turns on it's hind wheels!  Very easy to park...parallel parking is a snap with the turning ability and the backup camera.  It's solid on the road - although I haven't tried it in snow...I have taken it on rutted dirt roads and it drives like a dream.  The pickup is smooth and instantaneous (which is what I wanted...I wanted those ponies to race getting onto a freeway....and they do :)  )  For a 4 cylinder engine...it's got some moves.  Mileage is a little less than I'd hoped, but not too bad.  It's a heavier vehicle (obviously) than my Honda civic so I'm putting gas in it about a third more often than before (most of my weekly driving is in town) but it takes regular so the cost isn't outrageous.  The interior design is stellar...there are almost NO blind spots in this car!  The entertainment center and the climate control are my biggest disappointments.  I got the basic package...and the sound system is less than wonderful.  It's ok but...could be better.  The climate control is a little difficult to maneuver while driving and I would have preferred something other than dials.  A better design would have been to place that portion of the dash at an angle to make it more available to the driver.  The control keys on the steering wheel take a little getting used to....and the Bluetooth can be a little frustratingly slow and cumbersome.  Outside of those tweaks...I'd still buy this car.  I'm enjoying every minute I drive it.",pos

"Buyer beware, this car has transmission issues. (look up 2015 jeep Cherokee transmission issues) I couldn't understand why my brand new automatic car was hesitating, shifting between gears slowly and running sluggish until it died on the side of the road, miles from home! Come to find out there is a software update issue. I waited 3 hours for Chrysler Road Side Assistance to come ( an hour a half later than they said) and was just told I may need a new transmission.

"All Pilots come without a CD player – something that sales people should point out! It costs about $280 to have Honda add one. I had Honda add one. I drive a lot and listen to books on CD while I drive. It is important to me that the car remember where the CD left off when I turn off the car. That way it will continue the story when I start driving again. About 10-20% of the time the car forgets where it was and starts the CD from the beginning. I've owned 4 Toyotas, A Mitsubishi, and a Subaru and this has never happened with any of them. Otherwise, the infotainment system is a mess. It is not at all intuitive. It is difficult or impossible to operate with gloves on (I live in northern NY and it is cold in the winter). The voice commands are finicky. It forgot all the speed dial numbers that I manually entered!  The infotainment display occasionally gets stuck - an obvious software bug. As for the rest of the car, it downshifts too far when accelerating quickly. I pull a boat and admittedly, the car is good at that. The driver's seat is comfortable but the driver's seat arm rest tilts down at an odd angle and is next to worthless. The battery is inaccessible - I cannot use the car to jump start my tractor! In short, this could be a good car but it is plagued with a series of small but annoying design flaws and software bugs. Honda has been unresponsive to my complaints about the CD player.",neg

The dealership told me that they have loaner car for me but I have to come to pick it up by my own, I call Honda car customer service at 1 800 999 1009 and spoke with Stephanie and asked about reimbursement for car rental from my home(150 miles away) and she said no and sorry.

"It's my fault for purchasing this high priced piece of hot trash. After owning a 1998 Cherokee that gave me ZERO issues and a half million miles (literally) I decided to try another twenty years later. I'm not stupid, I realize nothing will produce what the old fashioned straight six would in terms of dependability and torque, but it's a new era and it's all about mpg and style.  I test drove the Wrangler, Grand Cherokee and of course this rolling hemroid before burning my cashier's check away on the Trail Hawk. Ranting about how terrible everything from acceleration to zero torque, to the plastic interior and cramped quarters won't do it any justice. Please just realize that your better off buying a Honda fit and spray painting a 4*4 Badge on it. Their about the same except maybe the fit has more testosterone. I just cannot get over how Daimler murdered this brand name. The other two ""jeeps"" I test drove had mini van V6 engines in them and also needed a strong wind from the back and a downhill to get up and move. If your thinking of buying a ""jeep"" after 2003 model year then do what I should have done and burn your money outside the dealership and know it's better than driving out of the lot in your new Fiat with an awd option called jeep.

"This is my second Subaru Forester.  My first one was a 2005 fully equipped 2.5xt.  I LOVED the way my car handled in all weather conditions and the pick-up of the turbo engine was a big selling factor for me.  When it came time to trade in my 2005 I test drove a Honda CRV, Toyota Rav, Nissan Rouge, Ford Escape, Ford Explorer, Subaru Forester touring and premium, Subaru Crosstrex and a Subaru Outback.  After spending hours looking at reviews and test driving vehicles I ended up right back at the Subaru Forester, but I wanted the turbo charged engine.  I found the Forester 2.5i did not have enough kick for me, so I special ordered a 2.0 XT premium.  I’ve had my car for a couple of weeks now and LOVE IT.  I have found the cabin noise I hated in my 2005 has been resolved with a new body style.  It’s great to hit the highway and be able to talk to someone without shouting.  I love where the new intakes are in the front of the car.  We had an ice storm last week and it handled beautifully on the ice.  There were people sliding all over the road and mine stuck to the road like glue.  It has far more room with the new body style then my 2005.  The performance has greatly improved along with my gas mileage.  I used to average 18 miles/gallon in town and now I’m getting 21 miles/gallon.  (Would get even better if I didn’t have a lead foot.)  My only complaint is I have found the seats to be a bit uncomfortable, but I will get used to that.  It’s more like sitting on a log now then a nice soft bed.  I had a 148,000 miles on my 2005 before trading it in and hopefully I will be able to get this in my new Forester.",pos
"My Subaru history is a bit unique. My wife has owned 5 Subarus: 3 outbacks and 2 Crosstreks going back to the 90s. I now have owned 3, all Foresters. Unique? 2015 Limited. 2016 Limited. 2017 Touring XT - the King. Prior, I drove: 94 Nissan Pathfinder, 2003 Nissan Xterra, 2005 Xterra and an 08 Nissan Rogue for 180k miles. I had a bad bait and switch experience with a Nissan dealer when it was time to trade the Rogue. To the Subaru dealer I went, tested and purchased in the most easy, straight forward transaction I ever had. Loved the 15, got a call from the dealer asking if I would trade for a 16? Amazing resale trade value was an offer too good to pass. Had the 16 for 18 months and 18k miles. I had a performance itch. I went online with a query and had multiple dealers quickly respond. I kbb'd my Limited's book value and went deal'n. I soon found out how rare availability was for xt touring models. More so for color/option choice. Order waiting from Japan was 3/4 months. One dealer had a prior ordered Pearl White w Saddle Brown Leather interior ready to arrive within days. I was there to see it backed off truck w 3 miles on the Odometer. A 4 mile test drive sold me. Easy deal with my Limited's great retained trade value.  3 days later I'm still giddy with the Performance UPGRADE! Add the lux and safety and sound system (Harmon Kardon 440watt), Wheels and Exhaust upgrades over Stacked Limiteds... just Slammed. This ride destroys an Audi Q5 that costs over 50k in 0-60 and qm times and crushes it off road. I love a deal. I love and require reliable. I love real world functionality. Add this level of Luxury and Performance? Feeling Fine! 
Now at nearly 4k miles and 7 months of ownership, i can say I still love my choice and like new ride. Zero problems. I added stainless gas and brake pedals to up the sport and Love factor. The ride is Fast and I always drive with the #S button pushed to max the Sti turbo factor. Amazing “sleeper” factor reveals itself often at stop lights, on-ramps and xways! Macho $$$  status machines see my rear lights often and humble pie is Served. I once had a hopped up Mustang. With this XT, i get to enjoy the same thrills in a much more reliable and functional and modern Chariot! For the price... there is no competition. The Real competition is much, much more expensive.
Update at 1 year ownership. Still like new. Quality workmanship and materials in my Touring XT have proven themselves and wear and tear hasn’t presented itself. Eyesight system was recalibrated at first oil change at 5,000 miles under warranty after I noticed rear automatic braking wasn’t quite working as it should. Works great now and gives comfort and confidence should surprising incidents occur.
Engine and Performance still thrill and I just love goosing the accelerator whenever I can. This is just an enjoyable ride to drive....Anywhere! I live in a remote location only accessible by a hilly, pothole filled,  mile long,  one lane dirt road that any car or vehicle without 4wd would be wise to avoid. No problems with the Foz in the mud or in the ample snow faced this year.
Recently, upgraded exhaust system. Replaced perfectly fine and still like new stock exhaust with an ‘Invidia’ 3” custom cat back stainless steel exhaust for greater performance and sweet sounds.
My pearl white ultimate performance Forester XT Touring continues to Rock. My Sweet Ride continues to get approving looks and grudging approval from owners of much more expensive and less able vehicles.",pos
"In February of 2011 I bought a V6 Overland and from day one there were issues. When coasting to a stop the brakes make a horrible humming noise. Jeeps answer: ""its just a minor program problem with no update."" Next was a complete failure of the A/C unit @ 9400 miles. Then at 12,000 miles the tailgate window hinge broke away from the glass because the adhesive melted from the sun. Next was the transmission banging into gear, that was another program problem. There are many other things that failed and I'm sure you can get the picture. I'm not one to buy extended warranties but in this case I ""thought"" it would be wise. The final straw was last week when my whole entire leather dash shrunk and wrinkled literally within 4 days when I left it in my driveway. That problem cost $3800 and of course its not warrantied. This vehicle has been in the shop a total of 24 times in the 33 months I've owned it. Unfortunately at month 24 it was one problem shy of falling under the Florida State Lemon law. I currently still have the jeep but in the process of selling it and never returning to Jeep. At this point its cheaper to cut my losses and go with a better quality manufacturer.",neg
"I have about 10,500 miles on my 2017 Subaru Forester. No, I do not drive a lot but love this vehicle every time I am behind the wheel! After 18 months, the car maintains a high mark (from me) overall. My fuel mileage has never hit the high Subaru claims but I am happy with an average of 29 mpg overall. I live in FL and use the a/c most of the time and I have been told I am an aggressive driver.  The car is great and within the price range is a winner hands down. Eyesight is awesome and I will never own another car without this feature. There is cabin noise; mainly some transmission sounds; not distracting but it does exist. The seats are firm. If one thing could be changed I would ask for 'cushier' front seats. The usb ports are handy but will not charge my phone. I chose Subaru because of safety ratings and the excellent performance of the 'eyesight' option. I changed from a sport sedan to a SUV for comfort and a higher ride with better visibility.

No one can find what is wrong. DO NOT SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS VEHICLE! All it has going for it, its the engine power. Nothing else!",neg
Great all around suv.  Check if you like the front seats,pos

I knew I was going to buy a Forrester.  I got the eyesight package by mistake and am very glad I got it.  It cost an extra $1200 and worth every bit.  The insurance on the new car was a little cheaper than my six year old trade in.  The car is much better than expected for the price.,pos
"I hate to admit it, my husband may have been right on this one. When we test drove my Pilot before I bought it, my husband did not think it handled very well and I fell in love with the interior space and all the technology. My husband wanted me to shop around a bit more before deciding, but I knew I was sure this was it. Now after driving it almost 2 months, I hate to admit it, he was right. It does not handle well, The steering is all over the place and I have trouble keeping the vehicle going straight. There is a bottom heavy feeling, but the feel of the road is not there and a delay from when you turn the steering wheel to when the wheels start to turn. I have to take corners very slow as I am not sure when the wheels will start to turn. I took it back to the dealer to see if anything was wrong or needed to be adjusted and was told it is the way the car was designed. They also told me I was not the first person to complain about the steering and they had already notified Honda about the issue. I know I am going to never hear the end of this from my husband, but I just am not comfortable driving such a poor handling vehicle and want to get rid of it. I am currently talking with the dealer on trading it on something better. Please don't make the same mistake I did.",neg
"This is the tenth Honda we've owned, so you know we WERE loyal!  Traded in a 2007 CR-V that we loved.  Our 2015 CR-V was the most uncomfortable car we've ever owned or ridden in.  Couldn't stand to be in it for a trip longer than 45 minutes.  The seats were awful, and the front passenger legroom was terribly restricted compared to our 2007.  It was so uncomfortable that we traded it in after nine months on a 2016 Ford Escape Titanium.  We love the Escape!  It's better in every way than the Honda:  comfort, power, quiet, handling, technology.  We haven't missed anything about our Honda once since the day we drove away from it.",neg

"My greatest complaint is the Manuals for the Highlander and the Navigation with aids are not updated to current models.  My Highlander Manual referred me to a page in which the compass was located in rear view mirror.  After an exhausting search of the Manuals I emailed Toyota Customer Service and two days later I get info that there is not a compass in the rear view mirror.  I am sure there are other shortcomings in the over 1100 pages of manual, however, updates should be done when the year changes on the vehicle.  
On the positive side, the suspension is great, the cabin in quite, and vehicle as a whole far exceeds any criticism I read before purchasing this vehicle.
I remain overwhelmed with the volume of info with manuals.  So many things I have simply given up on as I don't need them for the operation of the vehicle",pos
"I had an '08 Highlander Sport for 5 years, then thought it was too big for just myself. I owned two AWD wagons for a while; they are great cars, but I missed the quiet, powerful ride of the Highlander. My local dealer was offering great incentives, so I went shopping. The '18 Highlanders have retained what I had loved in my '08, and naturally, improved on them as well. Now I can ride interstates and large highways for hours at 65-70 and hear my own radio, and not get fatigued. I'm back, and it's great! The XLE trim is the lowest you should go, but get the Limited if you can. The Highlander rides large, but it's quiet and powerful. It does not accelerate in a punchy manner, but you'll be going 55, thinking you're going 35. It's that smooth. Nice interior! Gone are buttons: it's all touch now. Wow. Exclusively, the Highlander has a shelf underneath the dash: once you've seen it, you're spoiled forever. Nice ambient, blue lighting. Great stereo in the upgrade to JBL's many speakers: you can hear the radio at low volumes! Do you know how much that means to me? Wonderful!",pos
"I've owned/driven Hondas for the last 25 years and have always been satisfied with fit, finish, reliability, and safety and I have come to take these things for granted from Honda.  The point is, up to now, I was just satisfied but the 2017 Pilot has blown me away with seemingly all the things I didn't even know I needed.  I've never owned a vehicle with remote start but now I use it almost daily.  I love the auto door unlock/lock feature.  In the past when leaving my vehicle my hands were full and I used to have to fumble for the door lock FOB and juggle packages.  Now I just walk away and the vehicle takes care of itself.  When I return I don't need to unlock the doors I just grab the door handle and the doors unlock.  Don't buy navigation just use Android Auto it integrates well with all of the other Audio options.  I know these are just minor things but the cumulative effect of all the minor design improvements are going to WOW you and make you appreciate your decision to buy this car.  It's fun to drive, looks good, and gets good mileage.  I don't think you will regret it.",pos
"We looked at the Tahoe, Armada and Highlander and the pilot won us over on its winning combination of performance, economy, advanced AWD system and value. We travel to Vermont often on narrow, private roads that are not always plowed well. Honda's i-VTM is really the Acura SH-AWD with torque vectoring. On dry roads it helps some, but it is also a winner in the deep snow, shifting power left to right as well as front to back as needed. Really great system. The cargo space in this rig is HUGE, especially with part or all of the 3rd row down. The cargo area is equivalent is size to the Tahoe and more usable as the load floor is lower.  The acceleration is decent and I like the intake noise as the VTEC kicks in at higher revs. Without flogging it, I've seen high 20s for MPG on the highway. Overall, over the first 1500 miles, we've gotten 23 MPG combined.  The 9 speed feels a bit weird around 4th or 5th gear but it isn't a big deal. The push button shifter took some getting use to, but after a day we were used to it and it wasn't a big deal. I really liked the looks of the Tahoe, but for the money (and even not considering the money), the Pilot is an unbeatable combo of utility, economy and performance.",pos
The 2016 CRV still has a serious vibration issue and there is no fix from Honda.  I had a 2015 first and was told that the 2016 did not have the vibration issue but that was not true.  Honda used to be a good car but really dropped the ball on this issue.  I would never buy another Honda.  Buyer beware!!!!!!,neg

"In the Fall of 2014 we purchased a 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee Summit and our purchase decision was based primarily on the high level of satisfaction we had from purchasing a 2012 Grand Cherokee Summit in the Fall of 2011. Simply put, we were very satisfied Jeep customers as the 2012 had exceeded all of our expectations at that time. It was a stunningly beautiful vehicle, well designed and performed flawlessly over the first three years of ownership. The 2012 had experienced only two service required issues. One to replace a prematurely wearing seat bottom (warranty at 20,000 miles) and the second a failed heat diverter (owner cost, out of warranty). Other than that it was gas, oil and go for over 100,000 miles in a little under 3 years.

At this point (Fall of 2015) we decided to replace my wife's 2013 Chevrolet Silverado extended cab 4x4 with a second Summit and became the proud owners of a new Grey one but this time equipped with the Hemi V8. This upgrade in power really changed the performance of the Grand Cherokee positively and surprisingly only resulted in around a 2 mpg loss in fuel economy which was quite amazing. Most of our driving with both Jeeps is purely highway and the V6 averages around 24.5 while the V8 comes in at around 22.5 with both running at around 70 mph on relatively flat terrain. This sadly is where the good news ends.

It is hard to believe that these two vehicles were built in the same factory. The difference in quality is immediately quite evident. Paint quality on the 2015 is quite frankly ""poor"". Botchy and thin paint gives the vehicle a mottled look...as a matter of fact the factories inability to produce a quality paint finish caused them to cease production on several colors during the 2015 model year. This vehicle came new from the factory with more squeaks, rattles and strange noises than our 2012 had after 100,000 miles of driving. After a couple of months ownership the navigation system began giving false readings and this defect spread into all functions within the radio, navigation, heater A/C screen finally culminating in all functions in-operative and a pure black screen. It took numerous ""Updates"", trips to 4 different dealers and finally a complete radio/nav, heater A/C module and screen replacement authorized by Jeep Engineering in Detroit to remedy. During one service attempt the Jeep was in a dealership out of service for almost 2 weeks...not a ringing endorsement for an almost $60,000 vehicle....!!!!!

Moving on, the 8 speed transmission exhibits a nasty habit of refusing to upshift through the gears from a dead stop. Upon accelerating it stays firmly in 1st gear and will only come out after pulling over, putting the vehicle into park and then attempting to drive forward through the gears again. Updates to this point have failed to cure the issue. This leads into the electronic gear shift itself. Quite frankly, it is a very dangerous feature of this generation Jeep Grand Cherokee and has been changed completely for the 2016 model year. The chances of a failed complete move to park has resulted in injuries to Jeep owners exiting their vehicle thinking it is park when it is in fact in reverse. A very poor design since eliminated by Jeep.

Summing up the 2015 Summit I can only say it is an enigma for sure. We want very much to love it especially with the performance of the Hemi V8 which makes it a really fun SUV to drive. Additionally the size and configuration of a SUV and in particular this SUV is perfect for our use. But, the issues we have had with the vehicle are not what we expected from a highly awarded and expensive vehicle.

If I may, I would like to shift gears (pardon the pun) back to the 2012 Summit. Shortly after buying the 2015 the ""engine warning light"" on the dash of the 2012 came on and a distinct engine misfire became evident. A trip to the Jeep dealer netted a diagnosis of a failed cylinder head which was a defect in the early V6 Pentastar engines and which is covered by a Jeep/Chrysler extended warranty (150,000 miles). All costs involved in replacing the left side cylinder head are covered by this extended warranty but this dealership added additional repairs (which I agreed to) and which added an ""out of pocket"" expense of over $600.00 to the engine repair. Also the 2012 GC had developed an annoying rattle in the rear end which they diagnosed as worn and loose shock absorbers that they replaced at a cost of $700.00 (again authorized my myself). Now if the cost of shock replacement wasn't bad enough, when the vehicle was picked up the rattle was still there. Not to mention that when I checked part pricing for the shock absorbers themselves, the OEM shocks they installed cost $138.00 each while a neighboring Jeep dealer quoted them at $96.00 They claim their dealership has its own part pricing matrix. Simply put, the poor quality was bad enough but the recent servicing we experienced cost Jeep a customer...we have purchased our last Jeep product.",neg
"I bought the base model LE Highlander and I am impressed with it, especially the suspension and drivetrain.  It is very smooth, quiet, and fuel efficient.  The four cylinder model has all the power you need, as I have never had a lead foot. I got great mileage above the EPA 20 -25 mpg advertised.  I averaged 26.2 mpg on a 3600 mile trip.  By keeping your foot out of the gas, you can achieve good results and still do 70-80mph on the Interstate.  It handles well and has good control in rain and mountains.  The climate control system is superior and I liked everything about this vehicle, except the cloth seats could be better quality.  My wife complained that the side mirrors are too big, but I like them as is.  As an old geezer I don't really care about the new computer technology gizmos and this base model suits my needs admirably.  After comparing numerous mid sized SUV models, I chose this vehicle because I have had good luck with Toyotas.  This is my fourth.
1/23/17  update: Had car for One and a half years.  12,600 on odometer.  Still impressed.  Only complaint is 4 cylinder on cruise control can't hold top gear on slight inclines at freeway speed.  It constantly power downshifts at 75-80mph, which keeps me honest and ticketless.  The comfort of the suspension is still awesome.  It is mainly my wifes car and she gets 18-22 mpg around the city 'cause she likes to juice it more than me.  Very satisfied owner.
1/26/18  update: Vehicle is still going strong.  24K on odometer.  Moved to the Rockies, car handles high altitude and snow very well.  No problems at all.  Still, it's a mom bomb that rides like a cadillac so I'm happy with it.  Starts right up in cold weather (-5 degrees), warms up quickly, and the snow feature keeps you from slipping on packed snow on the road.  I think front wheel drive is 90 percent as good as all wheel drive if you don't get too crazy with dirt roads, mud, and snow.  Overall, the vehicle is holding up very well with the limited abuse I subject it to.  It is a good value for a base model.",pos

"It may be an ideal SUV for a small family, but it also fits well for us senior citizens. Easy to park; great visibility; easy to enter and exit - just the right height for that. Very quiet and smooth riding for a small vehicle. Engine and CVT transmission seem perfectly mated for this vehicle. Oh, the best part is amazing gas mileage for an AWD - got 30 mpg out of my first tank for city/hwy combined! What' s not to love!",pos
"We made an appointment to pick up our new 2018 CR-V EX from the dealer. After waiting 5 hours, we were told to go home and come back the next day and it would be ready. They provided us with a free loaner, the 2017 Pilot. We slipped into the seats to head home and they felt goooood!  The only adjustment I had to make was to reach the pedals.  The acceleration was strong and the shifts smooth. It was a pleasure to drive. The next day I picked up the CR-V and spent most of my time on the way home trying to find a comfortable adjustment for the seat. It is small and hard with pronounced bolsters. Since this is Honda's best selling car with a lot of favorable reviews, I'm surprised by the uncomfortable seats. The short cushion feels like it is cutting off the circulation in my right leg. The steering wheel in the Pilot must have been padded or wrapped in leather. It felt comfortable to grip. The CR-V's is hard plastic and becomes uncomfortable after driving for awhile. The rear seats can't be adjusted, unlike other cars. The center console in the Pilot is low and flat so the front seating feels open and unconfined. It also provides a good place to plunk down a pocketbook. The CR-V console is split level and interferes when buckling up and leaves inadequate space for the pocketbook. There are no pockets or drawers in the dash, other than the glovebox, and everything must be thrown into the center console. When accelerating, there is a slight hesitation to start, and the shifts... well, it is a CVT transmission. The engine has a small engine growl when pressed. The Pilot is larger and more expensive, but it might be worth the investment for such a pleasant driving experience.",neg
"I reviewed our 2015 Cherokee Latitude 4x4 V6 back in Oct so this is just an update. Our Cherokee now has 23k miles on it without any problems whatsoever. We bought it used (9K) last February and have taken it on many dirt roads (fishing, camping, etc., excursions), and are now in the midst of our 2nd winter (snow & ice) and we love its solidness and handling of all driving conditions, while enjoying the luxurious comfort and technology of the interior. We have consistently gotten between 22 – 24 MPG in overall driving and when we took a road trip from Reno to my brother’s house in Hesperia, CA, we were amazed with 30 - 31 MPG (almost all highway driving) both ways. My mother-in-law’s 2016 RAV4 is much noisier from road/wind/engine noise than our Jeep, and the RAV4 also has hard, cramped seating. All my 8 year old daughters friends love to ride in the jeep, and call it the “Robo-Car” because of all the high tech features such as ‘talking’ with the on-board computers female voiced assistant for everything from requesting a specific song to reading/composing emails, etc. We love our Jeep!",pos
"Gripe review.
This $40K vehicle is not what the quality or integrity I thought I was getting. I have only purchased Honda's for the past 25 years and am sad to say this is my last. 

Everything about the car was what we expected except that we never used the radio when we test drove it. Once we literally pulled it off the lot and started to listen to the FM stereo we noticed it had an issue. The sound quality was poor. It's volume would go up and down on its own and sounded muffled. I brought it to dealer and make the long story short it's a known defect with my dealer and AHC. BTW - currently there is NO FIX and no ETA.

"My wife and I bought our 2015 Jeep Cherokee Latitude 4X4 with the V6 used with 9K miles on it. We have taken several long road trips (750 plus miles each trips each way) and dealt with one of the wettest/snowiest winters in many years, and our Jeep made it all a true pleasure! We now have 40K miles on our Jeep and have had zero problems with it. We even managed to see 32 MPG on our long-distance drives to another state on Fuel Fighter tires! Our family loves the outdoors and we are avid fishermen, water sports, and camping-hiking types that frequently take our Jeep into the country-side mountains. It has handled every rough-dirt road, mud, snow, and steep roads with ease! Its also nice having the peace of mind with the nearly one-foot of clearance and the all important skid plates that protect nearly the entire undercarriage, oil pan, transmission, transfer case, etc.This and the mountain snows we often have to contend with are the reason we wanted a true 4 wheel drive vehicle and not a AWD SUV. Last winter we had to drive through some flooded areas after a very wet year with no problems at all! We love the tech package as our 9 year old daughter can work on our laptop, her Kindle Fire, and read books, or watch movies. She loves our Jeep so much that she is always trying to find reasons to take it for a ride. Especially with her friends who call it the Robo-car because of the panoramic moon-roof, auto-tailgate, and the female computer voice with which you can tell to change the radio, play a specific song, phone a person, read an email, or dictate your email, etc. Our Jeep is truly the most tech-savvy vehicle my family has ever owned, and a very comfortable interior to boot! And the nearly 9inch computer touch-screen makes everything very easy to access and the GPS navigation map very easy to see and understand. Early last year our best friends retired from 30 years working for a major oil company, and were looking to buy a new SUV. They liked the look of our Jeep and asked us about it. I spent more than an hour explaining and showing all the great features of our Jeep. These are folks with the financial means to buy almost any vehicle they desired but they went to the Jeep dealership the next day and took a fully tricked-out 2017 Jeep Overland for a test drive. They fell in love with it and bought it on the spot. They take it on frequent drives to the San Francisco area, and now have more than 10K miles on it, and say they still find new reasons to love their Jeep! Over the recent Christmas holidays our friends with the new Jeep Overland were speaking with some friends of my brother-in-law who mentioned that they were also interested in an SUV that would be safe for their young family. Our friends took them outside to show them their 2017 Jeep Overland and even let them take it for a drive. The couple fell in love with it so much they went out the next weekend and bought one of their own! My mother-in-law bought a brand new Toyota RAV4 a few months before we bought our Jeep, but after riding in our Jeep she now says she wishes she had bought the Jeep as she loves the interior size, navigation screen, tech package, and 4 wheel drive capabilities of our Jeep!

The 2017 Forester is noticeably quieter, there are now lights on the vanity mirrors...it's a girl thing!  The eyesight package is amazing, I just love having all that safety technology, especially with all the distracted drivers on the roads.  The peace of mind of the SOS button and road side assistance is a blessing.  The steering wheel tracking headlights are so cool!  There is a redesigned rear view mirror that is easier to use, with a larger viewing area, love that!  The upgraded stereo system is noticeably superior!  The trade in process was easy and fair.

"I bought a new Honda CR-V EX 2017 in February 2017 from the dealership, Castle Honda, in Morton Grove, IL. 

The car has problem getting started and, as a result, has become very unreliable and undependable. It has happened four times already and three times in less than last three weeks. 

First time the problem happened in August 2017 when I tried to start it after not driving it for a week when I was in vacation. I was able to jump start it with my other car. 

Second time the problem happened on 12/11/2017 and I was not able to jump start the car. I had to call the Honda roadside assistance on 12/12/2017 to tow the car but the tow truck guy was able to jump start the car. I drove the car to Castle Honda, the service department did some testing of the battery and said the battery was fine and they did not know the reason for the problem. I told them about the tailgate door not working properly as well, they tested that also and informed me that the struts were broken and and they ordered those parts. I drove back the car home hoping that the problem was fixed. 

I drove the car to Castle Honda again on 12/14/2017 to install the tailgate door struts. I am yet to find out what else is wrong with this car.

Third time the problem happened on 12/29/2017 and I was not able to jump start the car. I called the Honda roadside assistance and this time they sent a guy to jump start the car. I drove the car to Castle Honda, the service department tested the battery again and said the battery was fine and they did not know the reason for the problem. They told me to tow the car next time the problem reoccured. I again drove the car home hoping that the problem was fixed. 

Fourth time the problem happened was on 12/31/2017. I had to wait and seek roadside assistance on 1/2/2018 as the dealership was closed on 12/31/2017 and 1/1/2018. I called the Honda roadside assistance around 6.30 AM and requested specifically for the car to be towed, they said the expected time was between 3 and 8 hours. The tow truck showed up to pick up the car around 11 AM. The tow truck guy from J-TEAM AUTOMOTIVE declined to tow the car and started showing lots of silly excuses of why he could not do it. I did not want to let him go and wait another 5 hours before any help arrived and so I let him jump start the car. I drove the car to Castle Honda and turned it off while waiting in the queue in front of me, the car could not be started after that. The dealership service department tested the battery and this time found the battery to have issues and replaced it. I do not know if this will resolve the issues with the car and the car continues to be as unreliable and undependable as it were.

It appears to me that the dealership sold me a faulty car which has caused me lots of inconvenience and has costed me quite a bit in terms of hassle, time spent on the issues and missed work. 

I have been in contact with American Honda since 12/11/2017 and they have opened up a case on my car. The case manager keeps telling me that they bear no responsibility for the dealership or the roadside assistance and also only thing American Honda can do is to fix any issue the car may have since that’s what warranty is for. He does not appear to understand that having too many issues like I experience make Honda CR-V a inferior quality product, American Honda a low-grade manufacturer and Castle Honda a low-grade dealer. 

I have extremely negative customer experience with Honda CR-V, American Honda and Castle Honda. I will never buy any Honda product and tell others not to buy Honda products as well.",neg

"Vehicle: 2017 XLE 4dr SUV AWD (3.5L 6cyl 8AT 8 spd transmission) We purchased a new 2017 Highlander XLE after comparing it to several other vehicles in its class. Toyota touts quality and safety features as their biggest sales pitch, seems its there every time we turn on a tv. The transmission problem occurred at 8,253 miles, lucky for my wife, she was at a red light when the transmission failed and nobody was injured. The vehicle was hauled to local Toyota dealer on a flatbed & sat at the dealership for 52 days. We were told by dealer that a new transmission was back-ordered from California. After picking up the vehicle I noticed the work order stated part number 30510-48600-84 REMAN ATM and CORE RETURN. Re-manufactured parts should not be used to repair a brand new vehicle under factory warranty, which hasnt seen its first oil change. The day after picking it up I drove the vehicle around and excessive power train noise was present. Vehicle went back the the shop & they replaced both front wheel bearings at 8,392 miles and it sat in the shop another 3 days. Neither one of these repairs should occur on any new vehicle or a vehicle under 100,000 for that matter.

And the Acceleration of the 2017 Highlander is just painful. Overall it's just an average car, and it's not worth if you pay over 40K!

"My wife has a 2015 Legacy with the 3.6r and Eyesight. I love the pickup and Eyesight makes driving on the highway a lot easier. I bought the Forester with the turbo and Eyesight to get about the same horsepower and features. It sits higher, its easier to get into and out of and the cargo area is fairly huge (new lawnmower fit easily). The 2017 is quiet and rides very well (though not quite as good as the Legacy). I drove in some extremely heavy rain a week ago - admittedly too fast for conditions and the Subby just breezed through 6 inches of standing water and kept me straight. Really felt confident with it. The Touring has some great features and Im still learning the best way to use some of them. My commute includes some small hills and I really like being able to downshift the CVT using the paddles to slow rather than braking. My last car was a nice Mazda 6 with a manual 6 speed and thats what Im used to. For me, this car is almost perfect, I had the Mazda for 8 years and it was still going strong so I was a little worried that I would be disappointed - Im not. It isnt the best looking SUV Ive ever seen, but that really wasnt one of my main criteria. If you buy a Forester that has Eyesight available, you should think about it. Adaptive cruise and lane assist are great. The cruise lets you set the speed and when youre behind that guy that passed you and wants to go 1 MPH slower you can just let the car pace them and relax. Note it also will slow you to your set speed when going down hill using the CVT until it needs the brakes. So far, I havent found anything to dislike.",pos
"We purchased the Highlander XLE and realized after driving it for a couple of weeks that it did not have some of the safety features that we really wanted.  We traded up to the Highlander Limited AWD after 3 weeks of driving the XLE.  And, we love it!  The Limited has blind-spot monitoring, a back-up camera with alarms and several different traction modes. This is a great family vehicle although, the third seat is tight.  I would not recommend the third seat for older kids for any long trips.  The ride is quiet, the interior is comfortable and the exterior is a classy!",pos
"The 2017 redesigned Highlander is the best SUV on the market. It still retains the luxury SUV feel and comfort, all while bringing in new and improved upgrades! The new upgrades to the transmission makes stressful driving a thing of the past, with its comfortable shifting, cruising when you need it and power when you really need to step on it and put the pedal to the floor! And let me tell you, this baby has 5 USB ports! Who needs 5 USB ports you ask? Any family where the kiddos need to be constantly attached to their devices, thats who! That is genius on Toyota's part, now I dont have to listen to my kids complain and moan while we are all in the car. All I have to do is plug them in and they shut up for hours! I wouldnt consider anything other than the brand new 2017 Highlander, it has comfort, luxury, and power! I dont know what that other guy was talking about, if he really drove a Highlander he would know that everything pales in comparision to this beast of a machine! Plus, its got black tires, and who doesnt love that?",pos
"The 2015 CRV is plagued with vibration problems.  Honda admits this but has no solution.  If you feel you still want to test drive one make sure you do the following:
Turn off the audio, turn off the fan, turn off any a/c, turn off any headlights or wipers.  Make sure you drive the car until it is warmed up 10-15 minutes.  Windows up.  After warm up, stop car in D, foot on brake, car will vibrate.  Might do it in reverse as well.  If you take along a cup of water and place it on the center armrest,  it will be obvious.  Next accelerate up to ~ 2200 rpm.  Car will vibrate between 1800-2200 rpm.  More like a buzz as if something was loose in the back, something metallic.  If you maintain the rpm range at around 2000rpm, the vibration will remain constant.  The first vibration described is called mode 1 vibration by Honda.  The second type described is called mode 3 vibration by Honda.  They also reference in their video online a mode 2 vibration which occurs at over idle engine speeds but below the 1800-2000 rpm threshold of the mode 3.  Those buyers here who have negatively reviewed the 2015 CRV for excessive vibration are not exaggerating.  It does exist.  It is admitted by Honda.  They have produced two online videos addressing this defect but have not as yet delivered an effective solution.  This problem has existed with the 2015 CRV since its introduction.  That's over one model year ago, yet no solution.

Like many others, I trusted Honda as I have owned eight in total (3 CRV's).  As a result, I did not do these things when I test drove the CRV I bought.  I was unaware of the defect.  My test drive was with the a/c on, radio on, headlights on, fan on.  This will mask the idle mode 1 vibration, these items raise the engine rpm, which mitigates the vibration at idle.  The audio and fan noise will, at what I consider to be medium volumes, mask the mode 3 vibration noise as you accelerate through the 1800-2200rpm range.

This vehicle isn't ready for prime time at any price let alone what the varying models sticker for.  If you buy one you will be stuck with it and likely a significantly reduced resale value for years to come.

No new car at any price should sound and vibrate like these things do.  Buy something else or just keep what you've got...fair warning.

UPDATE:   Honda applied all listed fixes 12/15.  Solutions were effective for approximately 6 months when the mode 2 and mode 3 vibrations returned.  The Honda authorized solutions are not effective.  Dealer will not address the issue further.",neg

"I loved everything about this car during the test drive. The interior and exterior are amazing. The tech is the best in class and it seemed overall great. Then I took it home and my opinion changed. I tried every seating position and even used cushions, but could not get comfortable. Even worse than that, after 15 minutes in the car my entire foot and leg started to go numb. I made myself take it for a long drive and by the time I got to my destination my entire foot and leg ere completely numb. It took a while to get the feeling completely back and then the pain took over. I was limping the entire next day. So on the way back I tried cushions and other positions and nothing changed. The seats press on my static nerve and cause all of this to happen. I recommend this car for all of its features, but do not recommend it for comfort. If comfort is important to you look at different cars like the Subaru Forester or Mazda CX-5. I will be selling this back to the dealer for a big loss because I refuse to keep a car that will hurt me. Just beware before buying.",neg

"Bought this car as a downsize.   Traded in my 17 mpg Sequioia.    This car is MUCH smaller, much easier to drive, and much more ""car like"".   This is my second review.   The car is roughly 5 months old & has 3600 miles.   No mechanical problems thus far.   The ride is comfortable.   The front & middle seats are very spacious and comfortable.   The dashboard display is clear & intuitive.    Ride comfort is very good, but to be fair, roads where I live are very smooth.   Those who have criticized this car's acceleration are misguided.   We drive with the car in ""eco"" mode.   Acceleration is MORE THAN ADEQUATE!!!!    Step on the gas, and the car moves.   Overall mileage has been spot on EPA estimates:  roughly 22 mpg, with a bias of 65% to 75% city driving.   As for highway mileage, we took our first ""semi-long"" highway drive the other day, 300 miles round trip, 95% highway driving, set the cruise control at 68 mpg, and realized 28.4 mph upon fill up.   So, a 290 hp 3 row SUV, with full time all wheel drive, with air conditioning running the whole time, returned 28.4 mpg over a 300 mile trip.   Need I say anymore about fuel efficiency?    Pretty impressive, in my opinion.   If this car holds up like previous Toyotas, it's a no brainer, and should be on anyone's short list of 3 row. mid-sized SUVs.     11 months and 9,000 into ownership, we have only grown to appreciate this car more.",pos

So far I have 1100 miles on it. I am really enjoying the smooth ride. I traded in my 2016 Toyota Highlander for the pilot. I do miss my Highlander but the pilot has so much more options.

It could be improved. This vehicle has a auto engine idle. The navigation is neat. It shows you exactly where you are as if you are looking from the sky. It even has pictures of exit signs. The sensing is not as sensitive as people have stated. Its doing what is it suppose to do. Lots of interior storage. Leg room is good. The car seems so much bigger from the inside.

"I've owned the AWD Limited Platinum for over 6 months and couldn't be much happier with it. I test drove and researched many competitors, but it came down to this and the Acura MDX (AWD base). They were both around the same price, but of course you get all the bells and whistles with the Toyota, and I am so glad I did. Also, I actually preferred the ride and steering over the Acura. The steering feel is excellent...nice and tight. At the same time the ride is extremely smooth so you really get the best of both worlds. So even with the base V6 you will still enjoy the great ride. The bucket seats in the rear, suit our 4-member family perfectly. The amount of space back there, makes it a great place to be. The panoramic sunroof and heated steering wheel are as nice as expected. However, I was surprised by how much I use and appreciate the blind spot monitoring and the adaptive cruise control. I highly recommend this vehicle.",pos

How's that for American quality? The transmission issue is always a ""software update"" or they couldn't replicate it in the parking lot so it must not be a problem. The 9 speed transmission that is supposed to be a plus is actually a detriment to its performance, when it's actually functioning correctly. I have no doubt the Jeep Grand Cherokee or Wrangler are still great vehicles (out of my price range). The '14 Cherokee is not a ""real"" Jeep at all.

Pros: Very comfortable, great drive, good handling, first 20k maintenance included, reliable, very solid all the way around in every category, awesome tray under dashboard.  Cons:  Toyota still seems to be struggling a little with inside aesthetics, mixing colors that don't match, etc.  The third row seat is difficult to get to and very uncomfortable - Probably only viable for kids 7-13 age range, with even a small booster seat in the car it takes up more width than allotted for the seat so you can not take advantage of the 60/40 split with two in the car, you pay a premium price for features where you can get much more for the same money on a car like a Nissan Pathfinder (but this car handles better *Toyota that is*), small issue with blind spots as found in many cross overs in this category, gas millage much worse on highway and city than listed.

"Mostly my review is positive. I have one of the higher-end trim packages of the Subaru Forester, and, it is my first SUV as well as first Subaru. I'd love to see better climate control for the back seat people (they must rely on the front seat AC/heat vents to eventually reach them). There are limited amounts of cupholders, and the front two in the middle console are ok, but they are front to back with each other and the back one requires moving the armrest backward to a position where it's not really much use. I suppose the mileage is good for a car this size (I've only had it a month, and I'm averaging 25 MPG). But, coming from a Prius C prior to this, and having 50-54 MPG regularly, this is a bit hard to take. (Deep breaths, it will be ok). The safety features at this point in my life are more important than MPG. I am loving the ""Eyesight Technology""! I love sitting up high and feeling a larger presence on the road. Love the steering responsive headlights, and the backup camera is awesome. It's a smooth ride, and a good looking car. It did have a complicated electrical/computer problem the 2nd day that I owned it, so back it went to the dealer for three days. All seems to be well now, after a special technician was called to make an appearance to come to the computer's rescue. It's only been a month, so I cannot speak to the repair cost issue, nor to the reliability of the car, which I will know as time goes on.",pos

The car performed flawlessly for 7K miles until it was involved in a front-to-side collision. The entire front end was taken out. This occurred at approximately 40 mph and there were no injuries. The car was repaired and once again performed flawlessly until my wife was hit by a drunk-driver last week. She swerved to avoid a head-on crash and the entire left side was taken out. Both vehicles were traveling at approximately 40 mph, and once again, no injuries. We don't know if this will be repaired or totaled, but either way we will be headed back to the dealer to get a new Highlander as soon as the dust settles.

We can't say thank you enough to the folks at Toyota for protecting our family during both of these unfortunate incidents.

"I bought a brand new 2014 Subaru forester because they claim to be dog friendly and reliable, sadly the interior center console is not dog friendly...within ten seconds of my dogs checking out the new rig it was destroyed.... My gas cover sticks and I have to ask for strangers to pull the lever while I pry it open with a butter knife ( had it to dealer six times to fix) and the engine burns so much extra oil we have had to undergo annoying oil consumption tests for three thousand miles. The air conditioner runs so loudly you can't hear the radio and the built in radio loses its set stations on a weekly basis!!! I bought this truck at full price brand new..under warranty ..but other then doing free oil consumption tests and bending the spring in my gas cover the warranty does not cover much. The reason I ranked my Subaru so low overall is that i am now in a battle with corporate over my paint job which has been months of trips to multiple dealers and pictures and hours on the phone to be told that my truck with less then 30k miles that sits in my garage has had its paint eaten off by acid rain... Mind you the two other vehicles that are in our driveway are fine... As are all my neighbors and friends... And I have not taken the car out of state.... And the one spot in the car with perfect paint....a door we had replaced by a local body shop after a hit and run when the car was two months old....strange that that paint is unaffected.... Subaru does not back the paint... And the paint warranty oddly enough does not cover any environmental issues...

I had to park my brand new car for a holiday weekend until a dealership opened up on Tues. They reset the light- said it was nothing. It came back on during  my ride home. I drove directly to the dealer. They had the car from May 27th-June 9th and replaced the transmission. I hadn't even made a payment yet. June 12th the light is back on!!! 2174 miles on the car. I only had it back 3 days..back to the dealer I go. Now they have the car from June 12-July 2nd and they tell me they have replaced the valve body. July 7th on my way to work and the light goes back on as well as the parking brake light and the 4x4 light. I smell something burning. The dealer has to come and tow the car away. Now I am calling Chrysler asking for a repurchase- I don’t want this car! They don’t call me back for three weeks. 
July 22nd I get the car back after a 2nd replaced transmission. July 28th back to the dealer again! This time a 3rd transmission is placed in the car and I get it back Sept 4th. The car at this point has 2664 miles on it. 
I filed a lemon law suit with FCA Chrysler on July 17th 2015. I am still fighting this claim. I have been driving the car since Sept but the transmission is not right. It screams down hills and does not shift. It screams up hills and shifts so hard the whole car jerks. The dealer tells me there is nothing wrong with this transmission. It does not shift well- this is not normal. Chrysler is not responding to the lawyers on this claim and they are trying to make me settle with a deduction for the miles I have put on the car. I cannot believe that Chrysler is handling this so poorly. I will never but another Chrysler/Jeep product again nor will I recommend them. The car stinks- the company stinks!

"I have had my new Forester Touring for about 3 weeks now, and what a blast to drive. Being my first Subaru, it was hard to decide on the Forester or Outback. They are both great. The Forester is easy to park, and visibility is excellent. The 2017 has been revised with a quieter interior. I chose Saddle Brown leather, and it looks sharp with the dark gray exterior. I love my music, and the stereo is perfect. Much better than a friends Outback. I chose the Forester because of the reliability , and I like the boxy look. It sets apart from other SUVs that look so much alike these days. MPG has been great ...upper 20s for mixed driving. Havent taken a trip yet, but looks like it will be great with the current MPG. I must say the Forester has come along way...I use to not like them as they were very loud with road noise, and rough....not the case now. A lot of vehicle for the money...try one out !",pos
"We purchased a new 2017 Highlander XLE after comparing it to several other vehicles in it's class. Toyota touts quality and safety features as their biggest sales pitch, seems it's there every time we turn on a tv. The transmission problem occurred at 8,253 miles, lucky for my wife, she was at a red light when the transmission failed and nobody was injured. The vehicle was hauled to local Toyota dealer on a flatbed & sat at the dealership for 52 days. We were told by dealer that a ""new"" transmission was back-ordered from California. After picking up the vehicle I noticed the workorder stated: ""part number 30510-48600-84 REMAN ATM and CORE RETURN"". Remanufactured parts should not be used to repair a brand new vehicle under factory warranty, which hasn't seen it's first oil change. The day after picking it up I drove the vehicle and very excessive power train noise was present. Vehicle went back the the shop & they replaced both front wheel bearings at 8,392 miles and it sat in the shop another 3 days. Neither one of these repairs should occur on any new vehicle or a vehicle under 100,000 for that matter. Toyota Corporate has been less than helpful & we're currently going through the lemon law process. Toyota has lost another long time customer, if I could rate the 2017 Highlander 0 stars I would.",neg

"Great value when selecting trim levels.  Almost all or nothing.  I can only imagine what you get with Touring and Elite trims.  Wife wanted more bells and whistles from what we had in a 2012 Pilot LX.  EX interior was rough like denim and looked like it would be too hard to remove stains.  EX-L adds luxury with leather, sunroof, power front row seating, and a host of other little overlooked conveniences.  I read complaints on the infotainment limits, but we love it and haven't seen what all the fuss is about.  We have to master the steering wheel buttons to keep our eyes on driving.  The Android Auto app integration is amazing.  I'm sketchy on the privacy tradeoff though.  But beats 1-2k for built in his.  The touchscreen is responsive to our liking.  Went with 2wd because I didn't like the 12' and due to sluggish acceleration and roughness.  The ride quality is great.  Nix the nitrogen option if you can, mixed opinion if it does anything.  Eco mode is noticeable because it throttles ac, acceleration and such.  Very nimble from takeoff without eco mode.  I'd use on highway more.  Shifting is almost unnoticeable with 6 speed transmission.  Still contemplating extended warranty since there is a lot of electronics involved.  Lane assist is useful, again maybe more in a highway scenario.  Looked at Toyota Highlander and 4runner, both couldn't beat the Pilot's 3rd row capacity without pushing 2nd all the way foward.  Didn't see the need for Honda-sensing, I'd like a to retain some decision making while driving.  I've had 5 Hondas before this, and the 2017 exl is a winner in my mind.  Only reason for some 4 stars is I just bought and don't know.",pos
"In April 2015 we purchased a 2015 Jeep Cherokee, brand new! They literally unwrapped it in front of us. We were so excited for a little luxury upgrade! This car was just gorgeous inside and out! This is our 3rd Jeep, in the last 5 years. Soon after the purchase we began having issues. When we would call into the dealership to bring up our concerns regarding the violent shifting of the transmission we were told it was “normal” on EVERY occasion. So far, in 9 months it has been in for 3 recalls and 2 “software updates”. By September ’15 the transmission issues had gotten so bad we finally got them to agree to “test drive” our vehicle, our numerous attempts prior to this were always met with “well this is normal for this vehicle” and then we were told that the service department was so backed up with transmission repairs that we would have to drop off our vehicle for possibly up to two weeks, before they could look at it and we would NOT be provided a rental since the “check engine light was not on” . After basically demanding that they check this problem out because the car was just months old and has only 6k miles on it they agreed to “check” it on September 18th, they still refused to give us a rental, and we agreed to leave it for the weekend so they could address the problem. They called to notify us that they had “test drove” the car and nothing was wrong with it, my husband requested that he be able to sit in a test drive with the service man the following morning and asked him not to start or drive the car until he got there, when he showed up to do this test drive the service department told him they test drove the car again (even though they were asked not to) and that again, they found “nothing wrong with it” At this point my husband was furious. Not only did they not address the problem, but they also didn’t care to follow the requests of the cars owner. Now it is January 2016, the car is still shifting hard, or not shifting at all, as well as an issue with  a recall that was done a few months ago for the car where when you would turn the air/heat on the car would sputter and almost stall, was happening again, even after the supposed “software update”  So we once again contact the dealer to address an issue, they again tell us we need to just drop off our vehicle for an unspecified amount of time and they will not provide us with a rental, mind you this is our daily driver. So we then contact Chrysler directly, where they inform us we are eligible for a rental, and they will make sure that we get one, as well as be able to leave our car at the dealership for 5 days and then we will go from there. January 22, 2016 we take drop our vehicle off at the dealership so they can try to tell us what is going on with the transmission, again we are told that this is “normal” they tell us that it is a “Fiat Transmission, and that it shifts gears differently”  miraculously this time the service department drives the car and says they do feel the issues we are bringing up, and that is was a “software update” to fix the problem. Well… I have already had a software update, that FAILED! Following I will list the issues; First the vehicle shifts roughly into every gear, causing my vehicle to jolt forward, second, when at a complete stop and then beginning to accelerate the  vehicle has a delay, the engine revs and it finally jerks forward to go. Most the time the vehicle reaches 5-6k RPMs before it ever shifts gears. Third, when you start the car and turn on the air/heat the car drops below 1k RPMs, shakes and almost stalls. NONE of this is “normal” as the dealership states, this is especially NOT “normal” for a brand new car with significantly low mileage. The transmission should have ZERO problems. When I received my vehicle back from the dealership this last time, I got onto the freeway to drive home and it wasn’t until the vehicle reached 6k RPMs that it finally shifted into a gear. This is 100% unsafe, like I stated earlier in my letter, this is our daily driver, it is the vehicle that I buckle my two young children into EVERY SINGLE DAY, I count on this vehicle to get me to and from my destination in the safest manner available. Because of the jerking from the shifting of the transmission it can easily result in an accident. There have been times where I have almost hit the person in front of me because of the jolt forward coming out of a complete stop, as well as almost being hit from behind because my vehicle does not accelerate properly. This is not something I want to wait around for, this is something I am not willing to deal with until another “software update” is available, or until the manufacturer finally recalls this vehicle (which will happen) because it is a clear safety issue, causing my family to potentially be injured or worse. I do not feel safe in this vehicle, nor do I feel comfortable putting my children in it. Two visits to the dealership to repair this problem is far too many for a car",neg
"We are recent empty nesters, and my wife wanted to downsize from her Honda Odyssey.   We really liked the Odyssey, but at 170,000 miles and 14 years, my wife started to doubt its durability.  I think it was more perception than reality, but if you feel nervous driving your ride and you can afford a new one, its time to upgrade.  We test ""sitted"" many of the competitors in the small SUV/CUV segment, and my wife was attracted to the Forester for its 1) outward visibility, 2) Subaru Eyesight, 3) practicability, 4) no-nonsense styling, 5) durability, and 6) ruggedness.  What is up with other brands using tiny windows?  I guess Gen X and Gen Y likes to hide under hoodies and baseball caps.  Maybe they should just cover their eyes with their hands.  The Forester was the only vehicle that she didn't feel as though she was looking out of a cave.  My wife is a blue jeans/track shoes type of gal (she doesn't buy or use makeup!), and the Subaru brand image fits her perfectly.   Subaru Eyesight clinched the deal for us.  It is driver assistance technology that includes lane departure, forward collision warning, emergency braking, and adaptive cruse control.  Its pricing was very reasonable and did not require expensive and unwanted upgrades.  Because we are entering our senior years, we felt that these driver aids will come in handy over the coming years.  We wish that it also had blind spot monitoring.  However, the windows on the Forester are really large, so you don't really need it.   I'm a mild car enthusiast and had my doubts about the CVT transmission, but it works pretty well with the engine.  There is a little lag with hard acceleration from a stop, and you may think twice about passing a car at 50 mph, but it really is not noticeable in puttering around town or shleping along the interstate.  After all, you don't buy a Forester to drag race.   We have only owned it for 2,000 miles, but so far so good: no discernible defects or issues.  How about me?  Well, being ancient, I wanted really comfortable seats, like the zero gravity seats in the Nissan Murano.  They are a dream.  The Forester seats are comfortable, but not stellar. I would pay more for better seats.  Also, the ride could be more compliant.  The suspension is a little stiff.  Maybe it will soften a bit with more miles. When driving over expansion joints on the highway, there can be a bucking motion that is particularly noticeable for back seat passengers.  How about technology?   The infotainment screen could be better, but it is acceptable, unless you get your undies in a knot over anything less than iPod ease of use.    Come on people.  You have a really blessed life if your biggest complaint is hitting the correct station on your touch screen.  In summary, we love our Subaru.  I hope we don't become those tedious Subaru zombies who rattle on about how great their car is, but I may have gotten the virus.  With a little luck, my Subaru will see me out!",pos

"The Honda Pilot is a very well built, high quality automobile.  It drives good, rides good, and is very quiet on the road.  It is filled with technology----almost to a fault.  It will take my wife and me some time to learn all of its features.  It is very smooth and is getting very good gas mileage.  I can't imagine that any SUV being made could have more features than does the Pilot.  It is also very roomy.  It also has all wheel drive and stability control, so is very sure footed in rain or snow.
We took a 3,000 trip to the northeast, and the Pilot performed flawlessly.  It is very comfortable and will carry practically anything a traveler would want to take.

"Overall a really great vehicle, very comfortable. Interior could be a bit classier but it is still good. This is a family hauler and it does that incredibly well. This is a solid generally pleasing vehicle. I test drove countless competitors comparable models multiple times. It took me 3 months to make this decision. Overall ride quality and standard options combined with Toyota’s undeniable reputation of quality and dependability won me over. I have to admit though that every American made suv in this class was superior in comfort, quality of interior materials, ride comfort and amenities out shown every Asian vehicle we tested. However these tended to be priced higher and there is of course the questionable reliability. We tend to keep our vehicles for a decade or more so dependability was the ultimate deciding factor. There is one large problem with the Hylander, the outdated and outgunned engine infotainment system. This system is difficult to navigate and lacks basic things like smart phone mirroring. I am at a total loss on why Toyota would install such a poor system especially when just about every competitor has a much more advanced and intuitive infotainment product. I will say this though the navigation programming is excellent. It is easy to set, has nice graphics that make sense and are easily readable.",pos

This is a nice car I like the looks of it. The ride is good a little on the hard side but it handles good because of it. Visibility is very good much better then the other SUVs I tried. The interior is very roomy and the seats are supportive. You set up high In the seats that helps with the visibility. The rear seats are comfortable but they dont fold all the way to front seats and dont fold as easy as my CRV. The car has good power for a 2.5 better then my CRV. And the CVT is much better then I expected it does take time to get used to. Gas mileage is good 29 to 30 on the highway and about 19 to 22 in town.

"It was an exhaustive search.  It boiled down to a Forester, Jeep Cherokee, or Mazda CX-5.  All wheel drive is an extra option on both the Mazda and the Jeep. The jeep was out first based on cost with options and the extremely poor reliability rating at Consumer Reports.  The Mazda drove like a sports car, but the cost added up fast with options and I didn't like not being able to get heated mirrors unless you stepped up to the top of the line trim level which put you in the low 30k cost area and added options I didn't want.  The Mazda had a lot of great electronics, but lets face it, in 5 years they are all going to be like like in-dash VCRs.  The Mazda's reliability rating was way below the Subaru, the Mazda was harder to see out of, and since the only traction tests I saw on line were Mazda productions and the only thing they highlighted on was acceleration on a snowy hill from a dead stop and the wheels always turned to the right, I was skeptic about the drive system as well.  That and in the test the Subaru driver always seem to be pushing the accelerator hard to make a slip.  The only test I would believe is if they chained them both together on a snowy field and did a tug-of-war.  I went with the Subaru since I wasn't in the market for a sports car and needed something that would deal well with a Minnesota winter.  I got what I wanted for 26k, a time proven all wheel drive system, heated seats, heated mirrors, rear defrost and wiper, and easy to see out of when snow clouds your view and it comes standard with a nice power moonroof which was an extra option on the Mazda.  I still have bluetooth, sat radio, and a bunch of entertainment features I don't even care about.",pos
Bought this brand new on 12/31/2014. Traded in a 2012 Accord to get into something with all wheel drive and a slightly taller driving position.  Shortly after purchasing the dreaded idle vibration started to occur. This issue alone would be enough for me to dissuade someone else from buying the vehicle.  Then we noticed that during cold starts there seemed to be a metal on metal grinding noise coming from the engine.  After doing some research this seems to be the VTC actuator which has been a well documented issue on the 2.4 engines for some time which Honda has still not yet fixed.  Now after only three years there is rust forming on the inside of a couple doors from the water drain holes. This car has been a huge disappointment.  Really frustrating because it gets fantastic fuel economy and is an overall practical vehicle. Would 100% recommend a different vehicle rather than this.,neg
Driver seat will not adjust height.  This is a safety issue as I can not see over the dash.  Honda said they did not know how to fix is and I had to wait for a recall -its been 6 months now!  The software constantly glitches when using the iPod.  The windows are sluggish and sometimes will not work at all!  The heater cuts out when stopped but running.  Terrible car!,neg
I would not advise purchasing the vehicle. It is so new that dealerships do not know how to repair issues with the car. I have taken my car for the same TPMS issue that has occurred 5 times and they are still unable to fix the issue. Now I am stuck waiting for a specialist to come out within 1-2 weeks with one day warning to get my car into the dealership. They have replaced all my tires and admit to not knowing what is going on. The dealership now says it is between me and corporate honda. corporate honda is unwilling to provide me a loaner car. Even though tpms is required by law.,neg

Noise in rear end.  It sounds like a rubbing noise when braking slowly to a stop.  Very annoying and it is loud at times and other times it does not make a noise.  Have taken to dealer twice.  Road noise is more than expected with this price vehicle.  Dealership is not very supportive in resolving the issue.  Navigation and radio system requires a long reach and is dangerous to operate when driving because it requires too much time and concentration.   Maps are not near as good as the Garmin  GPS system.  Car cuts engine off at each stop light.  To discount this feature it has to be turned off each time the car is started.  Have had some issues with electric tail gate not functioning properly.  Backseat has less room than other competitors SUV’s.  Adults would be very uncomfortable using them.  Dealership doesn’t  seem to be interested in supporting customer.  Don’t know if this is a Toyota organization trait or the individual dealership but usually the dealership minors the company policies.,neg
"The buzzing sound from the servo motor will drive you crazy.   The buzzing sound occurs when the interior air is trying to sync with the exterior air.

Replacing the servo motor requires taking apart the dash - an expensive proposition.  Due to the expense, Toyota is taking the position that the noise in ""normal"" and not under warranty.  Many online forums reflect this issue - search buzzing, noise, servo motor, etc.  Don't forget that the buzzing is loudest when the exterior and interior air are similar.  If you buy the Highlander in the Winter, the buzzing will drive you crazy come Spring.",neg

"I recently just survived Hurricane Harvey in the Houston area flooding. I purchased my 2017 Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk V6 in May. This past week, Houston was inundated with close to 50 inches of rainfall causing catastrophic flooding in many areas of the city. Luckily I had my Trailhawk. What this vehicle did was truly legendary. I was at a relatives house in a neighborhood where the water rose to 2.5-3ft deep in the streets, and the water was still rising. In the household we had 4 babies and 2 medically compromised senior citizens in addition to several other adults. One senior is on dialysis 3x weekly and the other is completely unable to walk and is on a wheel chair. We decided to evacuate the neighborhood due to the rising water levels. Their was no help from any city or county ordinances, we basically had to fend for ourselves. I had my Jeep Cherokee fully loaded with passengers and cargo and 2 other vehicles in our convoy, a Nissan Armada, and a Tahoe (neighbors wanted to evacuate with us who had young children with them). I first scouted out the best exit points measuring water depths. We started the evac, my Trailhawk in the lead. The vehicle easily forded through 2.5 to 3ft of water, with no water entering the cabin and handling it all like a champ. In one part we had to off road into a muddy area, the trailhawks 4wd system easily made it through. Unfortunately, the Nissan got stuck in the mud, at a slant with the medically compromised seniors in that vehicle. I luckily had a recovery strap in my vehicle and a nice man close by in the flooded streets loaned me a second strap to get more length. With both recovery straps connected, I hooked the strap from the Nissan to my Trailhawks recovery hook, I put the Cherokee in 4LO and locked the rear differential, and pulled that 6000lb plus fully loaded Armada out of the mud with my little Trailhawk. Once getting the convoy back on track, my Cherokee led the way through devastatingly flooded suburban streets until making it to an area of higher ground and access to the highway system to get to a safe place for the young children and to get the medically compromised people to help. All I can say is that this vehicle is one of the best I have had over the past 20 years of driving. It has excellent handling on the highway, the 271hp V6 has plenty of power and the seats are exceptionally comfortable. The interior components are of high quality and the vehicle is just built solidly. The 4 wheel drive system is amazing, especially having the locking rear differential. I got a great deal when I purchased this vehicle new. There is no other vehicle in its class that can compare. It is great on the highway and excellent off road. I can fit my 1 year olds car seat comfortably in the back and the suspension is excellent for an off road based vehicle. With the roof rails already installed from the factory, I added a Yakima load warrior, where I can put extra cargo and carry extra fuel jerry cans for any situation. I highly recommend this vehicle, because it truly saved a lot of lives that day. Truly legendary, only in a Jeep, kudos to Fiat Chrysler for building an exceptional vehicle that proved itself in a dire situation.",pos
"Junk junk, junk just changing the radio station is dangerous.  The engine knocks when I turn corners.  My rear window will not go down.  When I put the car in park it slides several feet forward or back.  I have to use the emergency brake every time I park even on flat roads.  The gear fobs on the steering wheel are a mystery to me.  I could be on a freeway going 75 and accidentally hit one of those and my car downshifts into D6.  Very dangerous.  I can't seem to shift back unless i look down and desperatly get it back into drive.  I do not know how to bypass that feature even looking at my owners manual. My car is always dinging.  Why?  I can't get that to stop.  My drive button is no longer readable the plastic has worn off.  My exceleration is a total joke.  I have to put the gas pedal to the metal just to get it to go.  The windows fog up instantly making it hard to see. I need to blast the defroster or pull over till I can see.  I used to have the old pilot and I wish I would have kept it.  I am sure there is more that I have problems with.  We are looking to a another car company to trade in this piece of crap.  Actually running.  Over priced and worthless.

"Bought this the week it came out at our local Honda dealership. This was the 3rd Honda Pilot Touring we had owned because we loved the brand. The love quickly faded as all the issues starting screaming at us. First off the 9 speed transmission in the Touring and Elite is horrible. Shifting is inconsistent at low speeds, seems to rev up when when downshifting causing you to quickly react with more pressure on the brake.Very jerky and hardshifts. Does not smoothly drive down isles in parking lots or city driving.
Another issue is the engine seems really loud while idleing, reminds me of an old 1980's American 4cyl with valves tapping, not something you would expect on a $40K vehicle.
I have taken this vehicle into the dealership and it is working perfectly according to them.
Honda did a nice job on the interior and navigation. Fuel mileage is great and highway driving is smooth.
If you like the syle of the new Pilot go with the 6 speed transmission and avoid the Touring and Elite models.",neg

"Purchased the 2018 Elite after much research.  Very happy with our decision.  We were between the Pilot, Highlander, and Atlas.  The Highlander was smaller and didn’t have Apple CarPlay.  The Atlas, although nice, doesn’t have the track record the Highlander and Pilot have.  Although many reviews complain about the 9-speed transmission, we have been happy.  It does behave differently than a traditional transmission but it just takes time to get used to.  Very happy with how quiet the interior is at highway speed and the ride is great.  Very happy with the mileage we are getting so far.  We only have a few dislikes…the infotainment system is a little slow and not quite as intuitive as it could be.  I wish the auto start/stop feature could be disabled permanently instead of having to do it at each start-up.  Although it has the premium sound system, the bass is lacking but is sufficient for a family hauler.  I wish the Honda Link app would allow you to remotely start the car.  Rear entertainment system is great for trips with the kids.  I can use the HDMI input and use my phone to stream movies.  Overall very satisfied with our purchase.",pos

"My Forester Premium with EyeSight is the most effortless vehicle to operate that I have ever owned.  It is effortless for me at 6 ft., 225 lbs to get into, and my wife at 5'1"" also finds it very easy to get into.  The seats are very comfortable and the seating position great.  Visibility is great also.  I fold the second row seats down and visibility probably rivals that of the Pope Mobile.  Driving it is effortless also, acceleration is more than adequate, handling is nimble, parking it is the easiest I've ever experienced, other than my old Jeep Wrangler, and the ride on the highway feels ""well connected"" to the road.  It's quieter than my 2011 Toyota Highlander Limited and the engine is about as smooth.  I have averaged 34 MPG over 14,000 miles, getting 38 MPG at posted highway speeds, and occassionally 40 - 41 MPG when keeping speed below 65 MPH.  The EyeSight really helps take stress off on long trips, with the adaptive cruise control being especially helpful.  I'm now considering trading my Highlander in on an Outback to get the EyeSight feature on my wife's vehicle, though, she rarely drives the Highlander anymore, opting for the Forester instead.  A great vehicle at a very reasonable price.",pos
"The vibrations at a stop while in gear with the brake in is just too much for me to ignore.  Honda will tell you it has something to do with the engine and transmission combo... It simply isn't true.  
Fact 1 - If I am stopped, in drive, with the brake pushed in, the car idle drops and the car vibrates horribly.
Fact 2 - If I am stopped, in drive, with the EMERGECY BRAKE on, and my foot off the brake, the vibration STOPS and the RPMs go up.
I try to tell Honda this has something to do with the power brake system pulling power from the engine, but they won't hear it.  Mark my words, they will figure it out someday, and the issue will be with the power brake system.
Besides the vibration issue the engine is underpowered from a stop. I find myself dropping it into low to get moving sometimes. 
As far as negatives there are two others. First the plastic on the door jam and in the trunk is not of good quality the first time you step on it or slide something across it there will be scratches. My last complaint is with the Bluetooth. When playing songs or podcast the play and pause button on the screen works when they want to. When making phone calls the dial by name feature is terrible. Sometimes I would try to dial by name and it would just dial some random numbers. I just use my phone's dial by name feature which works perfectly now. My overall opinion is that I would not buy another Honda. Despite complaining about the vibration every time I brought it in for service and being assured that I would be called as soon as a fix was made I still have not been called by Honda.
A couple of positive notes... when locking the doors with the key fob there is no horn sound. There is just a nonintrusive tone that sounds and even that can be turned off. Also, after 25 months of use I just got my first warning that my key fob battery was getting weak. The notice was displayed on the dash and was much appreciated since it would have been very inconvenient to have the battery die and find out the hard way.",neg

"I sold my Ford Edge and bought a Pilot. I’ve heard how great Honda is, etc. I literally cried the first day I drive the Pilot to work. Horrible ride compared to my Edge. The controls are substandard, the touch screen is not close to driver, it has no pick up, and handles horribly. I took advice from people who only drive Hondas. Well if you only drive one type of car how do you really know if it’s the best. What are you comparing it too?  In all honesty, my Edge blew this Pilot away. If I could return this vehicle I would. The best word to describe it is BASIC.  Ford Sync is light years ahead of Honda. All the controls can be changed using your steering wheel, never have to take your hands or eyes off the road. There is no upgrade$$ for Ford Sync. What was standard options on the Edge can only be gotten with the Touring version of the Pilot. Never ever again will I forgo back up sensors, lane change alert, navigation etc for a substandard vehicle that is ultra expensive for what you get.  Forgeign cars aren’t better. I can say it because I’ve owned both. Disappointed to say the least. Never again. First Honda and it will be my last.",neg
"I previously owed a 2011 touring model.  Had no problems.  I now own a 2016 Elite. Gas mileage, acceleration, exterior, interior and overall performance is much better than my previous Pilot.  The navigation system is a little hard to operate but that may be because I was so familiar with the older version.  I do not care for the navigation lock out .  It may be a safety feature but it disallows my passenger from making changes to the map and destination while vehicle is in motion.   The safety systems, and there are many, seem to work well.  I'm a little Leary of the forward collision system so I elect to shut it down.  I feel it sometimes over reacts  and then is sluggish to retire.  There is also a by pass for the engine idle shut off but it has to be activated every time the car is restarted.  Wish there was a way to disable this function on a more permanent basis.  Front seats do not seem as comfortable as on my 2011 Pilot.  That may be due to the seats being ventilated as well as heated.  The drivers seat arm rest and front passenger arm rest leave much to be desired in my opinion.  They are adjustable up and down but seem very small and rather cheap.  Other than those few complaints, I'm very happy with the vehicle so far.  May be to soon to give a thumbs up approval because I have only owned this vehicle since January of this year. Update. May 2017 after driving this vehicle for approximately 17 months I can honestly say this is the best automobile purchase I have ever made. Approaching 20,000 miles and it's tight as the first day off the lot. Normally drive at 75 mph on the interstate but yesterday we had an open stretch of road so I decided to see how it preformed at higher speed. At 113 mph it was still very quiet, handled well and still had much power left over. MPG overall is approx 24.4 and 27.6 on the interstate at 75+ MPH. Just an overall great vehicle. Dec. 2017 and 24000 miles. Still love this Pilot. Will probably purchase another one in 2020.",pos

My first ever jeep purchase and my last!! Nothing but problems! Started leaking oil at 500 miles. Yes! 500 miles. Nightmare steering aliergnment issues. Dealer could care less.

The battery is missing a bolt, the rear seat belt is broken and we haven't even had it a year. The backup cam froze on me and I almost ran into a wall in my garage. When I noticed how loud the car is, I took it back to the dealership immediately, only to be told everything is fine. Sometimes it shakes so bad you can't see clearly in the mirror. There always feels like something is scraping when we're driving! I was told it could be the software making it jump. There have already been 2 recalls! The air and heat do not barely blow on your feet. This car scares me so much; I don't feel safe in it.  I hate this car and want to drive it over a cliff!

"I knew the Jeep Cherokee was not given good marks for dependability, and apparently I drew the short straw. 

I purchased my 2015 Cherokee in May of 2015. Took a road trip 500 miles away and could not get the lift gate to close on the Sunday of Memorial Weekend. By the time Tuesday rolled around and the dealership was open, I had to have the car towed in. The dash display continuously showed a warning that the lift gate was open. The battery seemed to be hold charge, but by Tuesday morning, the car did not respond to the key fob and I could not get into the car. I used the mechanical key to open the door. The alarm went off, which I believe is normal. However, once inside the car, it would not respond to attempts to start the engine. There may be some ""trick"" that has to be done to clear the alarm when the key is used, but I could not find it anywhere in the very limited documentation and really was not in the mood to look through the dvd again after sorting through it since Sunday trying to figure out the first problem. The lift gate would still not close. Called a tow truck and had the car towed to the dealership. Once there.... everything worked fine. Asked the technician if they could run diagnostics to find what the underlying problem was. I mean.... UConnect was happy to send me emails telling me the lift gate was open and the alarm went off, you would think the data was stored and could be retrieved. Nope. Can't determine anything without the fault currently being active while at the dealership. Wonderful. Went home waiting for another iteration of frustration. 

In September, went to my golf league. Unloaded my clubs and locked the car. Realized I needed to get my sun glasses. The door would not open, didn't recognize the key fob. Used the key again. The alarm went off again. Could not start the car again. Called the dealership and asked if there was something I needed to do to reset after the alarm went off under those circumstances. They said no, I needed to have the car towed in. Called roadside services. Waited almost 2 hours for the tow truck. At that time, the car worked fine. Called dealership and asked, can you run diagnostics and let me know what happened. Of course not, the car has to be exhibiting the bad behavior for them to know what's going on. 

I am a single woman and a Realtor. I cannot afford a car that can randomly and unexpectedly not start. If the dealership won't even look at the car to figure out the problem, and I can't know I can get where I need to be 24/7; then this vehicle is unacceptable. I cut my losses and traded it in on a Ford.

"Great vehicle, driven two long road trips and averaged 32.2 mpg. With in town driving currently at 31.4 mpg.

"It is too soon to answer some of these questions such as fuel economy, but my experience so far is good.  I especially like the visibility with full Windows all around and the driver's seat raised.  I wish the passenger seat was also electrically controlled  it is comfortable as is.  I especially liked dealing with the people at Matin CA Suburu/Mazda dealership p.  Straight forward, reasonable price.  No need for dickering.  They didn't push extras .  I drove my car off the showroom floor the first daY went in.
I have returned a few times for more operating instructions  which they gladly give.  I got the security feature Eye Sight.  That and other features made a lot to remember. The price below includes registration, license, tax, $1400 for 3 year maintenance at Suburu, and gap insurance recommended for first few months to insure replacement if my coverage falls a bit short.    ( I have a comprehensive insurance.). Update.  I am not thrilled with mpg, but I am told the reading is not totally accurate the first few months and I am primarily a short distance driver.  Example I drove 11 miles mostly freeway but also in town with three or four stop lights.  The mpg at end of 11 miles was 23.5.  All city driving it is quite a lot lower.

The transmission has been fine, no complaints. Yes, they have had a few minor recalls, but saved them and went in only twice, each time getting a free oil change and car wash, as well as ride to/from home. I like the service.

I have taken a couple of trips and the Pilot handles great on the highway. It has plenty of power and really good response. The seats are extremely comfortable on long rides and there is very little roadnoise which makes ride even better. The controls are all easily accessible and are quite easy to use. The safety features are excellent like lane departure warnings,the rear camera and automatically slowing you down if you are following too close to other cars.

STAY FAR AWAY from any of the new Chrysler/Fiat models. In regards to this model, the Cherokee, I am sure you have read many reviews on the transmission problems, and the difficulty in dealing with the dealership and service people. This vehicle is a complete disaster. We have to deal with them on a daily basis, everything from the transmission to electrical problems. One of the worst lately is the thermostat fails around 30K. The problem is so bad we have mothballed our 2015 models because the replacement thermostat ""unit"", which is a non-removable thermostat housed in a multi-port junction, is unavailable for MONTHS because they are out of them.... it is a nationwide shortage. These things are dropping like flies. If yours goes out after warranty, prepare to pay at least 2 hours labor (HARD to get to) and $200 for the part. This is the worst vehicle I have ever dealt with, so if you heed the advice of someone who has worked on hundreds, STAY AWAY.",neg
I had been driving Suburbans for about 20 years and decided I was done with large vehicles after driving a small SUV for my daughter from Florida to Oklahoma. I was seriously looking at the Nissan Rogue and Toyota Rav4 when I stumbled upon the redesigned CRV at a Honda dealership. We have had 4 Hondas in the past and everyone of them lasted forever with minimum trouble or maintenance so I had to stay loyal to Honda. We bought the Touring model AWD and it had everything I wanted for creature comforts except the cooled seats. I ABSOLUTELY love this car. Has the 1.5L Turbo and does very well in most circumstances for acceleration. I have been getting 30+ MPG in the city. I get slightly less on the highway when speeds start reaching above 65. Between 45-65 I think I average about 35 mpg and about 27-28 mpg when above 65. The interior is not of the highest quality materials but it works great for us and looks nice. The controls are easy to use once you learn about them. I have zero regrets about buying this vehicle and am looking forward to driving it for a long time.,pos

I took the car  to yhe dealership they did a software update did not resolve the issue.

"First off, I read every single review on every single website I could find about this car, spent hours doing research and watching videos before deciding, the best source is cars101.com! all about subarus!! I am coming from an '04 Nissan Frontier pick up truck, so this is an entirely new feeling/ride for me, both of my parents have Mercedes, so I have comparison on both ends of the spectrum. I test drove the forester 2.5i & 2.0L, cherokee, patriot, cx-5, rogue, rav4. And then I also peaked at the honda cr-v and the kia sportage. The top priorities for me were cargo space, reliability and gas mileage, then I wanted something a little different, with some flare for under 28-30K. The XT package is so rad man, my car came with the gunmetal grill too, its so clean, the rims rock, the front of the car is aggressive, sporty! I don't know why people hate on the styling of this forester, I think its the best looking CUV on the market, I love the boxy look too. All my friends dig it and say it looks like a BMW - but thats the XT. I am a hand drummer and percussionist and I sometimes need to load over 30 drums and percussive items in my car for events, I fit more instruments in this car with the back seats down than I could fit in my entire truck with a tunnel cover on, I was also able to fit my 19"" frame road bike in the back with ease (get the cargo cover and rear seat protectors!). Gas mileage so far is lower than I expected in the city driving (14 - 21 mpg), but higher than expected on freeway drives (27 - 35 mpg). I don't commute to work over the summer, so I'm mostly driving city, I calculated the MPG on my own and I'm avg. 20 MPG... not stoked about it, but man... I got that turbo engine and it rocks my world, so much pull in the S# mode, its such a hoot to drive, makes be care less about filling up the tank as often as I did in my 2004 pick up.

Addressing some of the issues that most unhappy buyers complain about... 

#1 Seats: im 5'11"" 165 lbs. I fit in the seat nicely. yeah the bottom of the seat is a little short, but honestly I wouldn't have noticed if i didn't read all the damn reviews about how uncomfortable the seats were. They are definitely firm and they are lacking some major lateral support, especially for how well the car corners. I don't think the lumbar is obtrusive. Anyways my experience is funky... I hated the ride after I took it on a drive longer than a 10 minute tester drive. I constantly had kinks and tension in my neck and shoulders. I have long legs so i would pull the seat back for leg room but then feel like i couldn't grab the steering wheel without leaning forward. So i read into the reviews, I was so upset, the new car feeling was gone, I tried different seat additions and was looking into custom covers with built in cushion support (I might still do it to get more lateral support) - I think its the cleanest and cheapest way to make the seat comfortable without cutting it open and messing with the warranty and OEM parts. Long story short... I woke up one morning and the pain just stopped. it was so weird, at least thats what it seemed like. the pain when driving just went away... I think I got used to it, take it on a long test drive if you're worried - ill report back after my upcoming road trip!!

#2 Stereo: I worked the kicker speaker set and the tweeter kit into the deal for my vehicle. So they put it in for free. I got to drive around for about a week with the stock system, I am a musician so I feel like I am a little picky about my audio. Stock isn't bad, it distorts a little at high volumes and the sound isn't very clear, the kicker speaker kit does help with the distortion, but the lower end coming from the stereo isn't very clear at all, its very boomy. I would love to change out the head unit, but I am not going to mess with the warranty yet. Have them put the kicker system in, Im sure you will love it. I am just not crazy about the sound coming from the OEM stereo unit. I LOVE the layout though, don't need a nav with the iPhone and don't need the bright lights, the deck and whole interior for that matter is so simple and functional - I'm all for simplicity. 

#3 Bluetooth: I have had ZERO issues at all pairing with my iPhone 6. you don't get your contacts to merge, but so what? hold you siri button and ask her whoever you want to contact. I haven't experience i single dropped connection and the phone connects automatically every time i get in the car and turn it on.

Update:
Had the car now for a year and half.... Great ride, stable, safe, don't use turbo as much, but it's nice to have. I wish it was a little bit heavier of a ride.

Neither of them could be fixed. 1.  Unable to start the car because I could not depress the brake enough to start it. This was a random problem.  Did not happen when I took it in to the dealership, so they had no idea how to fix it.  2.  Horrible shift from first to second gear. Takes and extra second to engage transmission. When I am accelerating, there is a noticeable lurch. Was told it is the way nine speed transmission works. Well, it is really bad!  Would think a more expensive car would be smoother! 3.

"This is our 3rd Honda Pilot Touring. We jumped on this as soon as they came out. Big mistake! The car is nice except the loud engine noise while idling and the 9 speed transmission.

My suggestion is if you like the car get the 6 speed automatic and skip the 9 speed.",neg
"I purchased the 2017 Grand Cherokee 4X4 Limited with Tow package, single pane Sunroof, 9 speaker with Sub-Woofer and Nav, all that I was looking for. After looking a big and small pick-ups, SUV offerings from Ford, GM, Toyota, Honda and Nissan took a look at the Grand Cherokee and was really impressed with the styling, fit and finish of this vehicle. Was looking for a vehicle that would give good mileage around town and occasionally tow a small travel trailer and fits in the garage. Rated at 6200lbs towing with the 3.6L this is the one. Was absolutely amazed by the power of the Gas V-6 and 8 speed tranny. Initially was experiencing hard up and down-shifts but as explained in the owners manual the transmission will learn and improve shift smoothness as you train it... sounded strange but its true. Initial hard shifts have smoothed out and other than noting engine speed changing, the shifts are smooth as silk. Mileage in mixed driving has averaged over 22MPG. Highway mileage is over the specd 25MPG. Besides the comfort and appointments of the interior (which is excellent) is this vehicle is quiet. The only flaw was a broken inner door handle that was discovered at delivery and part was ordered, scheduled for and replaced by the dealer 4 days after delivery. I researched the vehicle thoroughly and all the previous issues (transmission, engine, etc.) have been addressed in this years offering.",pos
"Do not buy this car.  When you put it in gear you never know if it will go forward or backwards no matter what gear it is in.

I will never , never, never, buy another Jeep.  Also I had the worst dealership.  When I called about my car during the 6 weeks they kept the car during the first 3 months of ownership I was told that nobody in the shop know anything.  I had to take off work to talk to the shop about the status of my car.  they thought is was okay to sell me that loaner car at the same price of my Jeep which was about $10,000 less than my Jeep. Usually drive about 20,000 per year but I am afraid to drive this car!  Plan to sell as soon as possible!  Paid much more than it was worth.

Bought a new car and it was so much better the Jeep.  The Jeep  turns off when you stop at a light and turns back on when you touch the accelerator.  Several months before I bought a new car the Jeep did not turn on when I touched the accelerator. That was a bad feeling in the middle of the intersection.

New car is so much better and now I feel safe driving!",neg

"A lot of reviews shown are for older year models. The 2017 I have gets 34+ Hwy and 28+ city. The backup camera screen is larger than before. I like the visibility and headroom a lot. So, comfort and mileage are the reasons I bought this model. Paid invoice, around $25k",pos
"I've owned a 2015 Subaru CVT for one year and have put 10K miles on it around Denver, Colorado.  I am extremely disappointed, and look forward to replacing it soon with a real car.

I chose the Subaru Forester for very practical reasons:  Great visibility, reliability, road clearance for the occasional offroading, and all-wheel traction in the winter.  These elements, however, do not offset the downsides.  

1.  Most annoying has been the constant rattling of the vent and speaker grills on the dashboard.  Turns out that this problem is well documented on the Internet, yet the dealer acted surprised when I brought it in for repair.  Twice now they have failed to fix the noise, and I have an appointment to take it back a third time.
2.  The CVT, in combination with the slow-to-warm-up Boxer engine, is so bad at accelerating that you must pro-actively plan your route to avoid the need for quick speed.  For instance, until the engine is warm, I have to leave extremely large spaces when going from my residential area to merge onto a two-lane thoroughfare.  And it takes the engine 10 minutes, or 2 miles to warm up (when the blue light goes off).   So don't plan to jump on the freeway and hope to accelerate to match the speed of traffic - ain't gonna happen.  Worse, the CVT is quirky, and not in a good way.  Sometimes a touch of the accelerator causes it to lerch forward.  Other times, it won't move.  I HATE HATE HATE the CVT.
3.  In the center of the dash is an information screen that shows your average mpg.  This number -- usually around 26 mpg -- is 2 and 3 miles greater than what I'm actually getting (calculated by miles driven since last refueling).  I'm beginning to wonder if they have programmed the onboard computer to deliberately do this - ala Volkswagon misrepresenting diesel emissions.
4.  The ride can be kidney-jarringly bad.  There is a stretch of I-25 through south Denver where the combination of road surfacing, the car's short track, and traveling at normal freeway speeds will cause the car to continuously shudder in a very uncomfortable manner.   (This happens with the factory installed tires inflated at proper psi).
5.  The wheel-wells are unacceptably tight for an SUV designed for winter travel.  Shortly after I bought the car in Winter 2015, I smelled burning rubber while driving on a snow covered road.  I was the only car on the road, so I knew it was my Subaru.  Upon pulling over and inspecting the car, I discovered that the snow accumulation  of 2-3"" in the back wheel-well was rubbing the back tires and causing the smell.  Now when it snows, I have to be constantly vigilant that this doesn't happen.  I can see how an engineer designed the very tight wheel-wells to reduce wind drag and improve gas mileage, but in so doing, they have seriously impaired the car's ability to travel safely in the snow.

Before purchasing the Subaru Forester, I did extensive research via Edmunds and Consumer Reports.  Both love the Subarus and failed to mention the problems I'm experiencing.  Not only am I disappointed with the Subaru, but I am also profoundly perplexed that after all my research, test drives, and talking to people, I made this expensive mistake.",neg

"I leased my 2016 CRV in August of 2016. By November 2016, my husband and I began to smell gasoline fumes that would overwhelm the passanger cabin while the car was idling.

I am paying for a car that I cannot safely drive. Prolonged exposure to gasoline fumes can lead to a variety of medical issues.

Since purchasing a Jeep Grand Cherokee in April of 2015 the forward collision warning system has engaged approximately 6-10 times, with flashing lights, warning on the dash and audible alarms when a vehicle traveling a good length in front of my Jeep was turning right and I was going straight on a city street. Although it has been an adrenaline raising situation I had not had it in for service just because of the hassle of doing so. On February 16, 2017 the vehicle crash avoidance system and brake mitigation engagement which included flashing lights, a warning on the dash, audible alarms and now abrupt, hard sustained braking occurred on a highway at 55 mph. I was nearly rear ended, as there was no reason for this very abrupt, hard braking. I immediately took it to the dealer, Transit Town Jeep in Williamsville, NY where I had purchased it, for service. Of course, all systems checked out fine. The next day following my service visit the same thing happened with all the alarms, lights and abrupt hard braking, (slamming on the brakes) but this time there had been no vehicle in front of me or anywhere around. I was on a two lane rural road traveling at 45mph with no vehicle approaching in the oncoming lane and no parked vehicles on either side of the road. There were no objects on the shoulder or side of the road. There was absolutely nothing to set this “safety system” off. It's very stressful driving a vehicle that may brake hard at any moment for no reason and you have absolutely no control. I took the vehicle back to the same dealer and we went through the same process. After four days, on February 24th the dealer informed me again that nothing could be found to be wrong and that I should pick up my vehicle. The vehicle is still at Transit Town Jeep, as it is not safe to drive. On February 24th I called the FCA Customer Assistance Center and opened a claim. By March 8th I was notified there was no problem with the vehicle, because the technicians could not get the vehicle to engage the anti-collision system while they test drove it.

As of today, March 10, the vehicle sits in my driveway as it is a safety hazard. If I were traveling 55 mph with a tractor trailer or large truck behind me and this system engaged, I would probably not live to complain about it. I have 14 months left on a lease that they will not let me out of, so I am stuck.

In researching this dangerous safety issue I have learned that this exact problem has happen to others beginning in 2014. It is not a common occurrence; therefore there has been no official recall by Chrysler. It’s interesting that there does not seem to be a remedy either.

I have also learned that if you choose to use this collision avoidance system in your vehicle, you need to turn it on each and every time the vehicle is started. I have never “turned this feature on”, which leads me to ask why is this system dangerously and improperly engaging when it isn’t even turned on? Jeep has  not stood behind their product and have given no indication that they are at all concerned about this vehicles safety hazard.",neg
I started smelling fuel in the interior and exterior of the vehicle after 6 mos of ownership. My CRV has been to the dealer 4 times without resolution.  Gas is getting into the oil pan (oil dilution).  This is a very common failure on these vehicles. I strongly recommend that you review 2017-2018 CRV Facebook page.,neg

"I needed a 8 passenger SUV for my family with growing kids, their friends, sports, activities, etc...  I narrowed it down to the redesigned Honda Pilot and the Toyota Highlander XLE AWD.  I reviewed many customer, and on-line expert reviews, and for me there was no contest... the winner was the Toyota Highlander XLE.  From looks and comfort to performance and safety/technology.  All of my past five SUV's all drove like trucks, but not the Highlander, this one drove like a Lexus!  It is definitely a head turner that I'm proud to drive.  I got the Blizzard White which is not your standard white, it's a more luxurious color for sure.  I'm 6'2' tall and I have plenty of room in the drive seat, which is not the case in a lot of SUV's.  Just to be picky...I wish it had a few more USB ports, and blind side indicators for this model, which is the more popular middle of the road model.

"The Pilot looks great on paper and in pictures, but don't be fooled.  The specs are good and it looks good in photos as most vehicles do however the reality is much different.  While fuel economy and engine performance are good, those seem to be the only things that don't disappoint.  But to get straight to the point, here are problems that I've noticed:

1.  The infotainment is a really terrible system.  It is underpowered, unrefined, unintuitive and cumbersome.  It is really slow and unresponsive, probably because of outdated/cheap components used to power the system.  Every tap lags, every single one.  The interface is also very unintuitive, common features such as playlists, albums, genres are buried multiple menu layers deep.  When you plug in your device, it defaults to playing your entire library of songs alphabetically.  I get random error messages that cause the audio or navigation to close on a fairly regular basis of about once a week.  An error message will just pop up and close the current app.

2.  The navigation, probably in part to being underpowered, has been terrible so far.  I've only used it a few times so far but each time is has incorrectly calibrated my location and it would take a few minutes of driving for it to properly recalibrate my location.  I've driven and used many vehicles with navigation and this is honestly the first time it's ever happened, on each occasion. 

3.  The radio is complete junk.  It sounds like listening to a 30 year old clock radio because the reception is so bad.  Sound is constantly fading, crackling or has static.  There has been speculation that this is something that has only impacted a few Pilots however I am convinced this is a design defect.  The antennas on the Pilot are similar to the antennas on the iPhone 4 and consist of bands on the rear windows.  What's worse is that despite this being an issue since the release of the 2016 Pilot, there has been no official response or acknowledgment from Honda yet.

4.  Because the radio is so bad on the Pilot, most people such as myself will often listen to the music on my device.  There is nothing wrong with the sound system itself, just the reception.  However, since the infotainment system is so incredibly bad, even trying to listen to the music on my device is a major pain.

5.  The footwell heat simply doesn't work well.  It seems like a minor issue until you have consecutive single digit degree weather and realize only a very small portion of the area above your ankles are warm.  The footwell area never completely warms, no matter how high you set the temperature or how high the fan is.  Your lower legs will always be cold, or at least mine have.  

6.  For the trims below Touring with the 6 speed, the shifter is so poorly and terribly designed, it looks like it came out of a 1990 Corolla.

Above all, my impression of the 2016 Pilot is that it was severely rushed and a lot of cost cutting was involved.  There really is no excuse for the radio to have such horrible reception in this day and age.  The infotainment system is clearly the result of cost cutting as its so terrible.  The main benefit of the Pilot is the engine performance.  I highly recommend anyone considering the Pilot to take it on an extended test drive and really pay close attention to the radio and tinker with the infotainment.  Drive it back to back with any other vehicle and I'm certain most will recognize a clear difference in radio quality.  However, if literally none of these things matter, than the Pilot may be a good choice, otherwise I would at least hold off until the 2017 models arrive before even considering one.",neg
"I bought Honda CRV 2015 EX-L and having Vibration issue from day one. My brother bought same day and all the Honda CRV 2015 has same issue.

"SO I test drove almost all the SUV's in the market before deciding on the Toyota Highlander Platinum edition 4WD. It is hands down among the best driving SUVs out there.

"Purchased a 2015 3.2L V6 Jeep Cherokee with the Auto stop feature on 04 Nov 2015 with 95 original miles on it. Within the first 150 miles of ownership the vehicle was taken back for a terrible back up camera and the odd shifting patterns with forward lunging in first to second gear. The dealership I purchased the Jeep from kept a full day to tell me theirs was nothing wrong with the camera and didn't even talk about the shifting patterns. So I assumed they tested and repaired. Nope was wrong to think that at all. Took jeep back again  at around 265 mile to again bring up the issue with the horrible hesitation and shifting problems. Service rep explained the vehicle needed to learn my driving habits and to break-in. So read the Jeeps manual and it stated break-in period of 350 miles. So I drove the vehicle with apprehension due to nearly being hit and almost hitting another vehicle. Jeep was taken back to service department with 587 miles where they performed a Trans quick learn procedure which only made the shifting and lunging worse. Was told to drive so the vehicle could learn my driving habits also. So I drove it to break-in as they stated but the issues never improved but just became worse. Vehicle was taken back at 858 miles and I explained it was progressing to get worse instead of better. They tested it and stated they could not duplicate the issues. Then was told that is how this model operates and it still is no broken in yet it required more miles  for break-in for that transmission and engine control modules to learn. Of course I knew this was nonsense. I contacted FCA customer care over the these issues and a case number was given at that point and was advised to take to a different dealership for a second opinion, huh was my response to that suggestion. A trip to Mississippi popped into the picture so had to wait till  I returned to follow their suggestion. I decided to drive the jeep to Mississippi and add these so call break-in miles to see if a change would happen. It became worse at times not wanting to accelerate through intersections to not wanting to accelerate while merging into traffic on I20 it was a scary drive. FCA was in contact with me and I told them what it did in Mississippi and Louisiana. The Jeep now has a long delay when going into reverse which nearly caused a on coming vehicle to strike my vehicle when I pulled out a little on a side road thinking it was part of a Canes restaurant parking lot in Ruston Louisiana. On the same trip returning from Mississippi on I-20 in DFW it became stop and go traffic heading west. Near Arlington I came to a complete stop on a slight incline with bumper to bumper traffic when the auto stop turned on like programed to do. Removed my foot off of the brake while hill assist was to remain engaged the engine had a slight starting delay more than normal and my jeep rolled backwards nearly hitting the vehicle behind me. I was under the assumption the Jeep would remain in place till engine started and transmission fluid pressure was back for the forward gear. Of course I became more frustrated with the dang thing now so took back to the service department  at 2256 miles for these added issues that could not be ignored. Service drove 6 miles and said can not duplicate after sitting several hours. Believe one of the sales people took it out for the drive instead of the technician. I know they are getting frustrated with me taking it back to them to repair but over $29,000 was paid for an unreliable vehicle. I finally wrote the CEO of FCA and explained the problems I was having with the vehicle and that I am only getting ""can not duplicate at this time"" response which I believe is now the policy with FCA. I received a call from a woman higher up the chain of command asking to take to a different dealership for second opinions which to me sounds like being pawned off and starting this run around all over again. I stated to her they were quick to put me into the vehicle so they should take responsibility for this since they know its history. She told me to set up an appointment at dealership I purchased it from so they could send a field service engineer so he could trouble shoot and see if a transmission replacement is required. Well two PCM re-flashes and of course no change it still runs the same. They kept from a Tues till Fri and it sat waiting on the field service engineer to advice the service department what the next step would be. I went and picked up my vehicle because no loaner was given while they determine what the heck was going on. I am still waiting on something to be done as of 01Mar 2016 by FCA. I looked into a class action lawsuit that has been filed against FCA dealing with this same problem and put my self and details on the list for these problems also writing a complaint the NHTSA. (Edit)1 Sept 2016 traded it for a 2016 Cherokee. Lost over 10g's in trade damn. 2016 9 speed trans is just as bad. Front suspension popping now.",neg
"I just leased a 2015 Honda crv exl. On the second day driving the vehicle I noticed the vehicle would vibrate when in Drive and I am stopped at a red light or stop sign. As soon as I start driving the vibrations disappear, as soon as the vehicle comes to a stop the vibrations start again.

The vibrations vary in strength (it sort of pulses in and out) and sometimes it's so strong that I start to feel sick to the stomach. It's become so bad that at every red light I put the car in neutral and only shift back I to Drive when the light turns green.

I have reached out to the dealer with no results. Their response has been ""This is because of the CVT feature of the engine (?!)

Its obvious that Honda is aware of this but is continuing to sell this vehicle with no disclaimer. I am lucky that it's only a lease. After 36 months I can say goodbye to Honda for good.",neg

"I went to test drive the 2016 Pilot and was not overly impressed with the styling, It’s very generic and blends in with everything else. Honda spent a lot of energy designing the interior and the quality of the materials is very good. It has a good use of space and a decent amount of usb and power outlets. I did not like the fact the rear glass does not open separately and a power lift is the only option. I frequently carry longer items and stick them out through the back window. I would also prefer to have a center console / arm rest instead of the flip down arms rest that remind me of a minivan. What really soured me on this new design is the way it drove. The steering has a very unusual feel that I did not like at all. Also the engine start / stop thing needs to go. It is just annoying and I don’t see a benefit, other than more wear and tear on the starter. It is clear Honda was more interested in how many cup holder are in the vehicle, rather than how it drove.",neg
"The redesigned Pilot is more of a minivan than an SUV. Just sitting behind the wheel makes you feel like your in a minivan with the lack of a center console and flimsy fold down arm rests. The quality of the materials is very good, however it does not drive well. The ride is  very smooth, but the steering is very light and does not feel stable. There is a heavy bottom weighted feel that is very weird and unnatural. You really can not feel the road at all. The lane watch feature and the back up camera are welcomed safety features, however the touch screen display is just annoying and is cumbersome to operate. I personally do not like it, nor do I care for the push button start. These are not welcomed features. The one touch seat decline/ movement is a nice feature, but more money and engineering should have gone into the steering and handling to make this a better handling vehicle. Sadly, the salesman told me very few people that have driven the new Pilot have liked the way it handled. I am not sure what Honda was thinking, but they need to go back to the drawing board on this.",neg
"I regret buying this jeep.  They are not at all made the way they used to be made.  Within the first 2 months of having it, the seat in the back bust at the zipper and cannot be repaired - has to be replaced.  One week after purchasing I had to take it back in because the tint was bubbling.  Now I'm at 15,000 miles and when you turn the car on, the RPMs go up and down and up and down and up and down.... then after about a minute they get back to normal.  The transmission does not shift properly and jerks you around.  I got the doors wet with rain and now all 4 of the door's interior are bubbling and destroyed.  This is the most expensive piece of crap I've ever bought.  I am so disappointed in Jeep.  Will never buy a new jeep again.",neg

"When testing this car take it for a longer drive. When car is warming up it drives with higher RPM so driving experience is good. When is completely warmed, the computer starts optimizing RPM for full efficiency. It lowers the RPM to the point that everything vibrates. You will experience vibration when car is stopped and idling. RPM will go down below 600 and the car starts shaking. After 6 months asking and waiting for the fix Honda changed transmission mounting to reduce the vibration when idling. To my disappointment vibration was reduced only a bit. The shuddering when accelerating is very strong - driving experience is horrible. I really hope Honda will address these issues. I tested other brand SUVs and I liked them. I went with Honda because of my previous experience with Honda Accord 2003 which was excellent. I will never trust the brand again.",neg
"My wife and I recently had a baby and decided to turn in my old Jeep Liberty for a 2016 Jeep Cherokee Latitude.  The thought was to get the baby into a nice, safe and smooth ride.  This car has been terrible.  The dealership and service area have been absolutely horrendous, but that's not what you guys care about.  I have had this car for six months and have had to bring it in for service 4 times,  not including the windshield wiper recall.  They have had to replace the radio system 3 times.  The touch screen and radio continue to black out which does not let me control the heating vent system, radio and rear view back up camera.  When I hit 30 MPH the back up camera goes on while driving forward.  The radio is in and out when this happens, not that I can control it.  This happened during the recent snow storms in Southern Maine and I was not able to select my rear and front defrosters as the buttons did not work on top of the touch screen.  Luckily when the radio and touch screen went it was already on these settings.  Currently still in the shop now while they are adding a new radio.   I also had to have my right signal repaired because it went out after 2 months.  They think it was actually the wiring connecting to the light.  took them 2 hours to figure it out. The interior is nice,but poor vision around corners due to the frame.  Smooth ride, but the 4 cyclinder is a little sluggish.  Actually impressed with handling in the snow.  But, I asked for options to replace the jeep from the dealer and they said to call Chrysler and complain as that's my best course of action or they could have me trade it back into them for a new Jeep but I they said I would have to pay more for it.

I have always had dodge products and this 2018 is the worst! Doesn’t start properly it’s been in the shop more then I have drove it! Now it has a device on it to try and find out what’s wrong with it? They think it’s my phone ?,neg
"I bought my Cherokee Limited (4X4 V6) in Jan 2014. I have to admit that I was distracted by all the ""shiny"" extras. Had I done some research I may have thought twice about buying it. If it weren't for the transmission this would be the best vehicle I've ever owned. BUT...the transmission has been a problem since not long after I bought it. It's been in the shop several times. The first two times they did updates to the transmission and it seemed to help some for a little while but the sluggishness and hesitation always came back. I took it back in June and let them have it overnight so one of the mechanics could drive it home (about 100 mile round trip). After that I was told it was ""running the way it was designed to run"". So, I sucked it up and learned to deal with it. Through the summer it seemed to be running a little better but as soon as the weather turned it started hesitating badly and the shifting was rougher than it had been. Then I started hearing a strange noise when I got to around 30-40 mph. I called the shop the next morning and was told to bring it in. Turns out something broke and all of my transmission fluid was draining and they are going to have to replace the entire transmission. I'm hoping this will solve all of the problems I've had from the start but I'm afraid it's just going to be like starting from square one. I've only read one review that talks about performance after the new transmission and it was a good review. Hopefully I have the same experience. I have several friends who own Jeeps, although none who own the Cherokee, and love them. I wish I knew how that felt.",neg
"My daughter has a 2014 Highlander and after driving it several times, I knew I eventually had to have one. The many included safety features was a big plus for me and there are times the eight seats helps with grandkids. My milage on highway is 28 and I take many long trips. The ride with the big tires is comparable to Lexus and I think it is better looking than the RX. Toyota reliability is legendary, so I plan on keeping it a long time. Update: I like this Toyota so much that I replaced one of our Lexus’ with a 2018 Camry two toned XSE V6.  It is gorgeous and love the power.",pos
"Before we bought the 2016 CR V we read many reviews, most where good. I remember reading one of someone complaining that the vibrations of the suv were causing back pain. I rolled my eyes and said I don't believe that. Well we went on to buy the CR V. After only a few days I notice that my back was hurting a little while after driving it, I figured i just did something to it. Then my husband started complaining that his was also hurting after driving it. We only kept the vehicle for 4 months! It is the worst vehicle we have ever had. Not only was it causing back problems but it was very noisy to drive, the interior was far from nice and we had the touring edition, and it was already starting to drive funny at 7000 miles. I will never again go back to Honda of any kind. Please save yourself the backache, literally, and look for something else. We instead bought the 2017 Acadia and it amazing!",neg
"I love my 2014 Highlander. I purchased new in February 2014 and this was my first Toyota. It did not disappoint. I have been driving it for 18 months now and it is just an exciting as the day I drove it off the lot. The interior is what impresses me most, the convenient shelf for my sunglasses and extras. The very large console for my purse, leather seats, cabin lights, sunroof and the blind spot monitoring are its best features to me. Several times the blind spot monitoring has alerted me to a child on a bike or walking on the sidewalk as I'm pulling out. The Traverse required $9000 more for these options. Love it!",pos
"At 10000 miles I started having trouble with the transmission and took it to the dealership where they had to reset some items for recall and to make it not stall, jerk and loose power. Now with 14500 miles on it I have the same situation. 5 times in the last week I got stuck in traffic and was put in harms way. It may have been a good idea at the time but I am tired of feeling that I will not make it to where I am going.....",neg

"Have had my AWD 2015 CRV since October.  When buying I had asked the salesman @ Stevens Point, Wi. Honda when the 16's were coming in.  He stated in the spring.  A month later the 16's were on the lot.  So he lied to me to make room for 16's.  This vehicle is made for those about 5'8"" or less.  It's a little cramped.  When the front seat is all the way back you can not fold down the back seat all the way without hitting the back of the front seat.  The AWD doesn't tell the driver when it's in AWD. Driver has no idea when the vehicle is in AWD.  I am sure this is a decent vehicle for the city but if you live out in the country in WI, MN or other snowy states this is not the vehicle for you.   My driveway has a small hill.  When it's slippery out the front wheels spin.  The AWD never kicks in.  In other words, I don't actually know if I have AWD.  The radio system isn't user friendly.  The CD system behind the screen is a little weird.  Mileage has been good getting between 32-35 on highway.  28.6 overall since owning.",neg

"Traded in our 2012 Highlander SE for the 2014 Limited. To say the least the improvements Toyota made on then Highlander are extraordinary! Better inside and out and sooo much quieter ride and smooth handling. We got the Limited over the XLE because we wanted the heated/cooled seats and the JBL stereo system. XLE is probably the best value but we love the one we got. Check out the new silver color too, it's not like the plain silver on other Toyota models, it's called silver sky and has a light blue tint to it that nicely sets off the chrome and black trims. Highly recommend so far!",pos
"We purchased a 2015 Jeep Cherokee 3.2L V6 with the 9sp transmission in May of this year.  At 10,700 miles it has started exhibiting transmission issues.  The Check Engine light and the Service Stop/Start System Telltale light came on.  The vehicle went into ""limp mode"" and would only do 35 miles per hour. I was on a major highway and had to pull off the road.  The rpm's were elevated.  I managed to nurse it home (only 3 miles) and called the dealership. (which is 46 miles from my home) I was told that it was ""OK"" to drive the vehicle to them.  I declined.  It never would have made it.  The dealership refused to have it towed to them and suggested that I take it to another dealership in town.  I once again declined and used my own AAA service to get it towed to them.  They had the car for 2 1/2 days (they did provide me with a rental) and told me that it had a software update that needed to be performed per a service notice and test drove it for 10 miles to see if the lights would come back on.  (I was skeptical because I had already started reading all of the BAD reviews)  I have driven it 83 miles and both lights are back on.  I purchased this vehicle because I was replacing a Town and Country Mini Van that we had for over 8 years because it was becoming unreliable......I have a ""new"" car that is already proving to be a LEMON. 
I will update this as my journey continues.
**** update ****
    This Jeep went into the shop again.     This time I was told it had a defective transmission, they were going to replace it under warranty.   after two weeks I had to call for an update, it seems they installed a new transmission (#2) from FCA but it was the same series of transmission and they were about to call me but were alerted to the ooops.    Another transmission (#3) was sent and it was installed.    In appx 110 miles, same issue happened.    They towed it back, we got the same rental (under the warranty, we HAD to drive a jeep product while ours was in for work).   In a nutshell, they installed transmissions #4 & #5 in the course of less than 16 weeks.   The jeep was in the shop a total over 40 days for the transmission.    
    We initiated ""lemon law"" proceedings  and in a few short weeks, FCA was required to buy the jeep back from us (minus a mileage usage allowance).     So while I consider ourselves lucky in that respect, we have decided, we can no longer afford to buy Chrysler.    The quality we had come to expect over the years (three generations) is just not there anymore.      even if the transmission had been a good component, the jeep was far less than one would expect from this legendary brand.
3rd and final update.    Jeep is now FCA problem.    they bought it back from us (thank you NC lemon law).    We have no plans on buying another Chrysler product.    Since this ""review"", we have purchased a Nissan truck to replace the Cherokee.    So far there have been zero issues.
edmunds is asking me to ""update"" this review.... the only thing i can say is that we are still very adamant about not purchasing another chrysler or fiat product.",neg

"Just spent close to 30,000 dollars on my first brand new car and one day into owning it noticed the vibration problem at idle.  I am so disappointed and feel Honda and the dealerships are scamming consumers.  They don't yet have a fix and are not telling potential buyers about this problem.  I would have definitely bought a different car had I read the consumer reviews (not the biased corporate reviews) prior to purchasing.  Having owned a reliable and smooth operating Accord for 13 years, I trusted the brand and the dealership.  A Honda loyalist no more.  Major disappointment.",neg
"Transmission is horrible - software updates can't correct the problem and it's ongoing. The Jeep learns driver's driving habits - I drive country, freeway and city to and from the work - Jeep doesn't know how to function. 
It's been in the shop 5 times the past 3 months and service says ""it's normal"" or ""can't duplicate the problem"". Transmission seems to maintain a high gear when slowing. When accelerating,  there is hesitation and the Jeep lunges. Crash waiting to happen.

"We've had our 2016 Highlander for just under a year now, and we love it. We traded in our 2013 Corolla when we had our first child and we needed something with much more space for all the new things we had to tote around for baby. We researched 4 different brands of cars; Chevrolet, Jeep, Toyota and Ford. The Chevy and Jeep had poor reviews ranging from the Chevy Traverse catching on fire 2 days after having it and the Jeep Grand Cherokee having issues with also catching on fire and having an issue with it's parking brake not holding and rolling away. It came down to the Ford Explorer and Toyota Highlander or 4-Runner. The Ford was slightly less money but after I read the reviews on the Toyota (and being a previous Toyota owner and loved my old car) my husband and I agreed upon one of the Toyotas. There was even a review from a mom who said that she was t-boned by a drunk driver in her Highlander and the vehicle rolled, she and her two children survived and the drunk driver did not. Sealed my thoughts on what I wanted, but we test drove each one anyway. The 4-Runner drove nicely and was spacious, but it felt extremely bulky and top heavy to me. Probably more well suited for someone who wanted to take it off-roading or out in the mountains rather than drive their kids to school and do family things. Next we drove the Highlander and my husband told me that he was very impressed with how sleek it actually looked in person. He said he was expecting something more of a soccer mom van/wagon style and this didn't strike him that way at all. We had our 10 month old son in the car and he instantly fell asleep on the drive in the highlander. The drive was smooth, the interior wasn't as roomy as the 4-Runner but it had a third row seat which we wanted, back up camera, and touch screen audio and blue tooth controls on the wheel. We took this car to San Diego to stay with my inlaws for a few days and my nephew, husband, son, mother in law, father in law and myself all fit in the car comfortably. When we go out of town to San Diego or somewhere around that distance, we only fuel up once for the trip (assuming it's a few days and not a week or so). I drive this car to work every day, and around town, to the neighboring towns about once a week, and I only have to fuel up every other week or so. And now with baby #2 on the way, I have no doubts that this car will be able to continue safely holding all of my precious cargo without making us cramped for space.",pos
"The sales person was informed on the phone and in person several times that I did not want a 4 cyl vehicle.  I was under the impression for a year that I was driving a 6 cyl with little to no pick up and a bad transmission.  I only found out from the service department when I picked up the vehicle from one of numerous visits to the service department that they thought it drove ok for a 4 cylinder.  I was stunned.  I pulled out the window sticker to check and it doesn't indicate if the vehicle is a 4 or 6 cylinder vehicle at all.  My fault for trusting the sales person.  I am stuck with a 4 cylinder Jeep Cherokee with major transmission issues, at 22K miles the struts went up as well as the thermostat, the lift gate has come down on my head twice and does not sense that anything is in the way (It's a good thing a small child wasn't under it)  once it almost trapped me between it and the bumper, I just realized today why the heat doesn't work in the car when I reached behind me to grab something off the floor and noticed that while I have warm air blowing in front, ice cold air is blowing on the floor in the back.  I don't even know what else there is to say at this point.  My next call is to the General Manager and then to Chrysler.
Update 1/4/2018- and the saga continues with this vehicle.  Chrysler replaced the transmission and when I picked the car up from the dealership I drove the car to a friend's house.  When we got back in the car and I put the car in drive and stepped on the gas, the car went in reverse.  We both looked at the shifter to see what gear it was in and sure enough it was in drive.  In addition to this issue, on 4 occasions while accelerating from a stopped position, the engine will stop pulling the vehicle.  The RPM reading 4-5K rpms and the car is drifting to a stop.  Chrysler says they cannot recreate the problem.  The car will engage after coming to a full stop and start accelerating again.  The owner of the dealership recommended that I trade the car in and take the loss because there are problems with all 2014 and 2015 models and as of the date of our conversation, they weren't having the same issues with the 2016 models.  The service manager put in writing that this was not a safe system.  When I asked him if he would let his wife drive the car, he said absolutely not.  Now I am in litigation with Chrysler and Don Whites over the car.  The newest problem that just started 2 weeks ago-water started pouring in through the overhead light.",neg
"I have always had a love for Jeeps. My first Jeep, Pigeon was a 1998 Cherokee Inline 6. I loved that car to pieces, she did me good the 5 years I had her, however, I'm driving a further distance to work and school so I had to give her up sadly. Ended up buying a KIA Soul, traded that in after a year because I was scared for my life in that car. Here I thought I was getting a dream car because I always dreamed about owning a new Jeep... Then this car entered my life and I regret driving this off the lot. I don't have as many problems as other reviews, but it's a BRAND NEW CAR and shouldn't have to worry about ""what if my warranty runs out and then all this happens"". This Transmission is really sketch. I hate the way it jolts at random. The acceleration in this car is just as bad as the Kia Soul that I traded it in for. The AC and heater are terrible. I can never be at a comfortable temp. You're either freezing or burning up. The gas is terrible on this car. I feel like my 1998 did way better in gas. The Uconnect is a joke. It works when it wants to work. I literally have to turn off my car at times for it to sync.  When it rains the tires spin and I'm not trying to jet off since it won't even do that if I tried. I'm very disappointed in Jeep. I was always proud to be a Jeep owner and now I'm kind of embarrassed. After seeing the crash videos on this car I hope I NEVER hit a pole or a wall because it seems this car like to burst up in flames. If I could get rid of this car I would. I want to take this car in and have everything  checked but from the looks of it, Jeep doesn't really care.  My love for Jeep has died. Whenever I get the chance I will get rid of this car. Unfortunately I have to wait many years before that happens. I better start saving now since my year is almost up in May. Do yourself a favor, don't get this car. I should have gone Import. I hate to say it but it's true.",neg
"I took my first long trip in my new 2016 Cherokee Sport.  First the Good.  Gas mileage as stated on the sticker was the gas mileage I got.  The comfort was good, not great.  That's it.  Nothing else good about this vehicle.  Second:  The Bad.  Do they make shocks for this vehicle?  I could feel every bump and crack in the road. On the highway you felt like you were constantly going over speed bumps. The radio was BAD.  You couldn't hear the sound because of the thumping of the speaker against the dash.  The air conditioner kept making noise.  I could hear the engine when the vehicle was sitting at a light or when we were on the road.  Now the UGLY:  NOISE FATIGUE:  Please stop the noise.  It never stops.  The radio makes ugly noise, the tires make noise, the air conditioner makes noise.  I'm tire of the noise.  I can hear other vehicles passing by.  I can't hear the radio with all the noise.  I'm giving this vehicle up as soon as I can.  There, I'm tired.",neg
After driving this car for almost 60K miles I have to say I won't buy another Subaru. The CVT transmission makes driving this car dangerous. Acceleration from a stop begins with a lerch of speed and then hesitants leaving you in a pause in front of oncoming traffic. The car is now burning oil like a jalopy. The brakes seized up and failed completely. Luckily repaired under the warranty.,neg
"Purchased car in the fall 2014, one issue of major concern is the 9 speed automatic transmission. Jeep updated the software, with little notice or improvement. Very erratic shifting and delays in moving from park to drive or between drive and reverse. Horrible climbing up steep hills of 45-60 degrees, car slows down and crawls up the hill unless you push the accelerator to the floor, and then it down shifts and speeds up with a strong jerk. Totally dissatisfied with the transmission, dealer says they've done all they can and don't feel there is a problem. After 4 Jeeps in the last 20 years this will be the last Jeep purchase I make.",neg
Don't buy this car if customer service on warranty items is important to you. I've made countless calls for a warranty issue and am constantly told by Chrysler they have no information and then the dealer tells me the info has been sent. Bottom line I have not recieved a call back more than a dozed times after I was promised a return call and resolution. Don't buy a Chrysler!,neg

"I have a Honda pilot 2016 LX model, this is my second Honda car. The experience with this car is horrible.
Recently, I noticed the water leaking into the car. During the rain in Fremont, CA, the water went inside the car all the way to the floor mat thru the dashboard. I took the car to the local Honda dealer to fix the leaking problem and inspect the dashboard and the floor. Water leaking could spread the rust quickly and may cause some electrical problem. A week later, I got my car back and within 2 days I noticed the water leaking problem is not fixed. I also noticed the metal inside the car dashboard is rusted. I believe, the service center didn’t inspect the dashboard, floor and find the root cause. Now, the car is at the same service center to fix the same problem.

The car has not only this problem, it had other problems like remote key was not working, tail light assembly was broken when I got the delivery, screws in rear of vehicle were stripped, takes too long to stop vehicle completely and ON and OFF smoking while driving.

The new car has too many issues, I’m also wondering how this car passed the quality control test and testing for water leaking.
 
My main concern is a safety since I have a newborn baby(5 months old) and a kid. I feel traveling with my family in this car may cause issues like computer failure, sensor failure, etc., so I’m avoiding to drive this car with the family.

I don’t recommend this car.

Honda customer service is also worst. I tried to contact the case manager, but I couldn’t reach him to know the status of the car. After several attempts, I reached him, he was simply saying busy with his work and he couldn’t answer all my questions, just saying “he is not a technical person”.

"Have had my 2016 Jeep Grand Cherokee Overland High Altitude for not even a year and have had so many different issues. First I started having issues with my shifter upon start up, the lights on the shifter would not turn on so the communication between that and the dash would not allow me to shift and then after a short amount of time they would pop on and service shifter would pop up in my instrument cluster along with the check engine light. Took it to the dealer and of course they could not replicate so hey just give it back to me and wait for it to happen again. Well it did so I took it back and yet again they would not do anything so they gave it back happened the next day so I recorded what happened so they couldn't give me grief. They finally replaced my shifter after initially wanting to tear apart my transmission for something else even though there was an open recall for other cars but of course mine was not included even though it did the same thing. Hadn't even hit 10k on the odometer at this point. After 5k miles what a shock it happened again and again the shopnwanted to tear apart my transmission and Jeep said no put a flight recorder in. So after a month it still hadn't happened now the dealer kept calling and harassing me to get the recorder back and I can just come back again after it happens again. During this time I had to have a taillight replaced because it cracked from the inside, dealer told me to call Jeep because they weren't going to risk a charge back. Also have had a plastic molding on the door start to fall of since it's smart to hold pieces of a car together with double sided tape and also a panel in the cargo area was warped. I have also had my auto windshield wipers malfunction twice and also my esc light has come on twice now along with another check engine light for I can't even remember what. I had to go to the dealer and upgrade my warranty to lifetime since I paid so much for this piece of junk I had to cover my ass for the long haul.

"The Jeep in extremely unreliable. The transmission tries to predict how you want it work, but what ends up happening is shifting from 0 gear to 1st (roughly 0-10 mph) there is a pretty hard shift. The transmission ends up struggling, and I'm sure it will go out much faster than it should because of the terrible transmission technology they created. I took my Jeep in for this issue 3 times and was told that that's just what is does and the best they can do is hope if my transmission does go out it happens before the warranty is up. Seriously! The Limited 75th edition also has 20 inch wheels when the wheel well is made for 18 inches. That means that the tires have to be low profile to fit. So, make sure not to use the Jeep for long car trips or take it off road (you know the main reasons to buy a Jeep)! The 20 inch rims and performance tires ruin the usability of the Jeep. I've had my Jeep 11 months and I've had 3 tires blow out. I've never had a tire blow out on any other vehicle I've had, and I've had more than 10 vehicles.

As with other people. Wish never purchased this car. Dealer covers up the issue with vibration just to get them off the lot. Then will not acknowledge or make an attempt to help. It has gotten to the point that asked them to buy back the car. There offer a 5k loss. They admitted do not want to take the loss themselves nothing they could do. Sales manager showed me the door. Now car sitting in driveway with 59 payments to go.,neg
