"Very comfortable compact SUV, last of the manuals in this model. Limited miles so far...Wish they would make American MT's with LIGHTER fly wheels!",pos
"There are too many weak components to this vehicle despite its popularity in the marketplace. The transmission is the most frustrating as it shifts into a higher gear after turning a corner instead of downshifting. The body design ""catches"" weeds and debris if you go off road even a little bit. The gas latch frequently freezes shut in the winter months.",neg
"When it rains the water entering and builds up between inside  panel and exterior body parts and leak in trunk area when open. Can press the rear pillars and water will drip out  and be wet,",neg
"We owned this vehicle for one day when I said to my husband, ""this car needs to be tuned.""  We brought it back to the dealer and they said they could not do anything.   Honda did not have a fix.  We test drove the car when it was cold out -- it did not vibrate.  When the car warms up -- the vibrations are so bad that I do not like driving the car.  Don't buy this car until they fix the problem.  I have been waiting 4 months ...no fix yet.",neg
Please.please...before you buy one do your research on the vibration problem that Honda is saying is a characteristic of the new Honda 2015 CRV. Met with a Honda America guy 2 weeks ago and he is saying All the 2015 Honda CRV have a characteristic of vibration. It comes with all the new cars. Honda not willing to do anything about it. Driven Honda's all my life. Never agin. Even if you do not know it your car will vibrate. My car started vibration problem.. 2 months after I bought it.  Please do not buy one. You will be sorry.,neg
Internet online purchase is the best way to buy any 2017 Honda Pilot!,pos
"Did tons of research before buying a new car.  Since cars are so expensive wanted one that would last long and was reliable. In the end it came down to Toyota, Honda and Subaru.  All are very reliable. Subaru has the best resale value. Was set on a crosstrek when I decided to test drive a Forester. Three things made my choice.  The incredible vision, no other car I drove came close, the added power, and the ample room to carry cargo.  Also the back seats are roomy and actually recline a bit. I'm 6' and feel comfortable in the back seats.  I like prefer the styling on the forester because similar cars that look sportier have roofs that slope down cutting down on storage and visibility. I down do rock crawling but I like to drive into the mountains to take photos, this car can go almost anywhere. Service roads and trails are no problem. I opted for the turbo for the added power for freeway driving, also comes with almost everything, only option is eyesight.  Subarus trailer hitch is great but expensive. I didn't buy a forester to race around I bought because of practicality and reliability, that being said I love driving it. While many cars corner better, this car can handle swerves and avoidance maneuvers better than anything I have test driven or owned, the AWD is amazing.",pos
"We purchased the Cherokee limited with the Active Drive II transmission to pull behind a RV. This was the trans we were told could be flat towed. We were not told that it came with an off road suspension which produces an incredibly rough ride on all but the smoothest asphalt. Speaking to Chrysler was a wast of time since they blamed us for not test driving the car. They don't seem to think they owe anyone the courtesy of telling them up front it's off road. A Luxury $40,000 SUV with ""Off Road Suspension"" begs the question what were they thinking or not thinking.",neg
I was unfortunate enough to buy Cherokee SUV and that car has been plagued with problems. FCA is nightmare to deal with poor support and denial when it comes to resolving issues. Do yourself a favor and avoid any FCA product at all cost.,neg
"This is the third CRV I have owned (08,13,17) it keeps on getting better. I love all the new safety features. They all got great mileage this one averages 30 mpg city/highway. This time I went up a model to EXL Loving the dual temp, leather interior and the wood trim adds class.",pos
"Frustrating is the only word I can use to describe my experience with my brand new 2016 Honda Pilot. I don’t know if it was a freak occurrence or maybe I’m just unlucky, but I drove my Pilot off the lot and about 10 miles later the Touch Screen Infotainment system just stopped working. I was ok with that honestly, things break, car manufacturing isn't a perfect process. However the thing that is unforgivable and what warrants a 1 star review for my brand new car is the face that getting Honda to repair it has been an absolute clown show. I’ve owned the car for 25 days and I’ve only had the car to drive for 5 days because the last 17 days the car has been in the shop. So here follow my timeline and make your own decision about whether or not buying a new Honda Pilot is right for you.

Day 1: I bought the car and drove it away. The sales process was clean and efficient. I drove 10 miles home and on the way my infotainment touch screen started fading to black.

Day 2: Driving the car around town the infotainment screen just stopped functioning entirely. Just a black screen that would show lines. Made an appointment to get the car in the shop the next day.

Day 3: After staying at the dealership for 3 hours Honda told me their computers found nothing wrong, and that I should leave the car there and take a loaner while they called Honda Tech support to figure out the issue. This wasn’t immediately possible as I was planning an out of state trip that weekend so I said I would bring it right back on Monday.

Day 7: After driving the car all weekend the infotainment system never worked once. It’s a blessing that I could control the radio was from the buttons on the steering wheel. I took the car into the dealership, and drove away with my loaner. All in all I had put about 780 miles on the car (150 miles of which was driving it back and forth to the dealership) They told me they hope to have it fixed in “a few days”. Great.

Day 10: Haven’t heard back from the dealership so I give them a call. The tech line said they should just replace the entire infotainment system, it’s on order and they should have the part some time this week. They hope to get me the car in “a few days”. Great.

Day 14: The part didn’t come over the weekend. We’re investigating why the part order didn’t go through. We’ll get this cleared up and get the car back to you as soon as we can. At this point Honda has had my car longer than I have. We’re starting to get really upset so we call Honda of America Corporate to see what's the problem. They said the dealership should figure it out and there is nothing they could do about it. They gave us a case number incase there was a problem.

Day 16: We’ve ordered the part but it’s on hold. They won’t release it to us yet. At this point we’re wondering if the part even exists. This is where we start pulling our hair out from frustration.

Day 17: I get a call from manager for my region at Honda Corporate. He seems just as upset as I am at how this has been handled and assures me that he understands my frustration. He say’s he’ll talk to my dealership's service manager and get the part shipping expedited. He says he’s going to investigate and crack skulls and call me the following Monday Day 21.

Day 22: The regional manager from Honda of America calls me back and tells me the part still hasn’t been ordered. That he’ll call me back with an update later this week. 

This is today. At this point all I feel is silent rage. The car was fun to drive, the features were amazing but how can I feel excited at this point. My brand new car that I paid for now just feels like it's a refurbished lemon. We’ve been given nothing but the run around by Honda and NOTHING has been done. THEY HAVEN’T EVEN ORDERED A REPLACEMENT PART SUCCESSFULLY. I’m exhausted. This was the first new car I’ve ever purchased. It’s been in the shop for 17 days and at this point I hope they keep the car in the shop another 10 days so they will be forced to replace or buy it back via the lemon law. It’s just been a customer service catastrophy so buyer beware and pray if your Pilot breaks that the replacement part actually exists.",neg
"This is my 3rd Highlander, and they keep getting better every time.  My first Highlander was in 2006 and it was the size of the current RAV4.  This new one has more room in the rear and the back seat legroom.  The from passenger compartment feels like it has a slight bit more width as well.  The controls (radio/camera, etc.) are easier to use and more intuitive than before.  The only wish I had was that they were angled slightly towards the driver.  This is my first vehicle that allows you to shut off the car while in drive and at a stop by simply depressing the brake.  This has increased the gas mileage for me.  My last Highlander was a 2012.  I got about 360 miles to a tank (regular driving) on a 17 gallon tank (21.1 MPG).  The new one, with the same size tank is getting 425 miles to the same 17 gallon tank (25 MPG).  The comfort is better, and not just because it is new.  I chose the LE Plus because of the full 60/40 rear seats.  I did not want the captains rear seats, as it is impossible for someone to lay down on longer trips.  I also did not want the sun/moon roof (hardly used it and one less thing to worry about going wrong).  Plus the price difference for 2 things I didn't want really made my decision easier.",pos
just got car very happy as can be determined by review  Some questions are N?A mine is a2018  Forrester premium,pos
"This is my second Honda in 3 years. I purchased a 2012 CRV back in 2012 (still have it and love it); you can see my original review of the CRV dated March 18, 2012 under the title ""EXCELLENT ""SUV"" for the Money!"" and an updated review of the CRV in May 29, 2013. Needless to say, I like the Honda brand and purchased a 2016 Pilot Elite. Let's get to the Pilot. With a growing family, I test drove multiple 3 row SUV's and the one I felt ok with the most was the Highlander...until I heard about the new Pilot coming up so I waited. Very GLAD I waited! First impressions of the Pilot were very very good. I wasn't crazy about the design in pictures, but in person it's a different story. Exterior was very sharp and very pleasing on the eyes. From the A pillar back, it looks beautiful, I just wish they put a little more effort in the front end design (not ugly, but not my favorite part of the vehicle). I love the wheel design too. Very Audi and Mercedes like. Inside, if you go with a Touring or Elite, it almost feels like you are sitting in a luxury vehicle, and yes, I've owned multiple luxury vehicles, I know the feeling :-). Very very minimal use of plastics, most of the cabin is soft touch materials that you find in Audi, Mercedes, BMW, etc... The cabin and dash are not cluttered with buttons and levers everywhere, it is very simplistic, classy and clean (almost Audiesque). I saw a couple of complaints about the touch screen in reviews, but I had no problem, feedback was quick and easy to use. If you see my CRV review, you'll know how much I hated Honda's infotainment system, so with the new Pilot, first impressions were, wow, Honda finally put some money into this! I love it so far. The seats are very comfortable and upscale (everything in that car feels upscale if you go with Touring or Elite). The second row seats were just as comfortable as the first row. Plenty of USB and charger plug-ins in the back for kids. One of the most important things for me was the third row room and trunk room while the third row is up (trying to avoid a minivan...yea yea I know, they are the most practical for families). You can easily and possibly comfortably fit a 6' person back there; anyone under that size will be very very comfortable. I personally sat back there and will be happy to sit back there for a long trip, it's a pleasant place to be. The seats weren't quite as comfortable as the second row, but they are comfortable enough, and definitely way more comfortable than the competitions. I opt'd for the Elite because of the captains chairs and the ease of access to third row since it will be occupied; my only complaint from initial impressions is that you have to go with the Elite to get the captains chairs. Also, I am giving the interior design a 9 here instead of a 10 because if you get the bench seats and have car seats (not booster seats) on each side of the bench seat, you can't move the bench seat forward to allow someone access to the third row (hence the reason why we opted for captains chairs); so my issue with that is why haven't manufacturers copied Infiniti's second row design where it tilts down and slides forward with a car seat to allow access to the third row (check out the Infiniti QX60 second row design on youtube...pretty cool). I guess Honda wants you to pay for the Elite to get the captains chairs. Next step was if I can at least fit a double stroller in the trunk while the third row is up...yep! and with room to spare for groceries. Lastly, the drive. Driving impressions were pretty good. Very quiet, very smooth, a little on the artificial side of feedback from the wheel (but hey, it's not a sports car so who cares, right?). Throttle response can be a little bit better too. So those are my initial impressions of the 2016 Pilot. Overall a big 10. I keep telling myself I am so glad I did not end up going with the Highlander or the Infiniti QX60 (except for that seat design in the Infiniti that I love) because the Pilot blows them out of the water! I'll do my usual updated review after about 20,000 miles of driving. If you're looking for a 3 row SUV, get yourself into a Pilot, you'll LOVE IT!",pos
"I financed a CRV SE in September 2016 and two days or so after having the car I had to go back to the dealer complaining about this vibration that is only felt when the car is idle or when stopped at a light and/or traffic. I feel very disappointed in Honda for not having a fixable solution to this problem. The dead just tells that ""it's a V4 what you are experiencing/feeling it's normal"" there no way in hell that you can say that a car that's clearly vibrating and that you as the ""tech or mechanics"" is also feel that there's something not right on the vehicle you can tell me it's normal!!! The worst part is that they tell me that they can get me into another car but it's going to put me a negative equity or something thing like that which means that they are going to give me a quote on how much the CRV is valued as of now and they are going to deduct what the consider out it and then I'll owe the rest! Totally not fair.. I feel that as a ""respectable"" brand as Honda should have more respect and transparency with its customers and fully advice them of this problem! But, that's not all the ""AWD""crap is BS.. I had such a hard time driving in the snow this Winter and to make it worst I was stuck!!!   In the snow. I had to get out and shovel my way out and just so you know I have a bad back! No it's totally unfair to be paying all that money to get into a car that's not even going to give you half of what you are paying for, so do yourself a favor and don't buy a CRV..",neg
"After driving the Jeep Grand Cherokee for 8 months, my right leg began to go numb. After analyzing the situation, I determined that the front seat doesn't line up properly with the pedals and steering wheel. The brake pedal is too far to the left and it forces you to bring your right leg too far across to the left to break. Further, your body is always at about a ten degree angle to the left from center in the seat. I am now sitting on pillows to force my body to the left in the seat. The pillows force my body to the left and I am now centered with the steering wheel and pedals, however, my body is now hanging off the side of the seat. In summary, either the seat isn't lined up properly with the pedals or the pedals aren't lined up with the seat. Something is off and it is extremely uncomfortable. I am going to have to look to sell the car as a result of this.",neg
I just bought this vehicle and have driven a rental car more than I have driven this. I was on day 29 and the transmission would not get out of second gear. Got it fixed but 1 week later it did it again. Worst vehicle EVER!!!!,neg
"Hi All,

2. My office commute is 5-miles/day- within 5-miles yesterday i got this alert Engine temperature hot
3. Acceleration raise automatically when you are stopping in signal.
I called Honda care and going to the Dealer today and will update.

Update from Honda Customer Care: I complaint on Friday 10 Jun 2016, however i haven't received any response from them and their turn around time in 2-days.
                                                                  I got call on 14 Jun 2016 and its disconnected within 2-rings. I tried called daily 4-5 times and left voice messages no                                                    message/call back from them. I got a call on today 20 Jun 2016 after getting my car.

Service Update: There was a faulty radiator fixed in my Car by the Honda company and this made mixing of coolant/transmission fluid. Now they told that replaced the radiator and some hoses in my car.

I dont expect this after spending 50k in my car from the Honda Company. I hope this review will help you.

Thanks,",neg
"First new car, first time Honda buyer. VERY happy. Absolutely love the space in the car. The technology is amazing. Do not have the DVD package, wanted kids to actually interact with me in the car :) LOVE the Honda Road Readers - can download books onto my iPhone and then using the bluetooth, we can all listen to stories. My favorite!",pos
We bought a Civic Hatch and a Pilot and love them both. We gave our 2013 Honda Civic to our daughter and traded in our leased 2015 Toyota Highlander. Hands down the Pilot blows the Highlander away. It's so smooth and a dream to drive. We have always purchased our Honda's from Lindsay Honda. Their customer service is hands down the best. They make sure you are totally satisfied throughout the life of the car. Mike was great to work with. We took many hours trying to make our decision regarding which vehiclies were right for us. He is very knowledgable and answered all our questions. He also took time with us after the vehicles were purchased to go over all the features and connect our phones. We are 100% satisfied with our experience and would highly recommend buying a Honda from Mike at Lindsay Honda.,pos
I'm happy to get this vehicle. This will be my retirement car.,pos
"I bought a Honda CR-V 2015 and was beyond excited. It was the car of my dreams. I had test driven it and everything was fine. It was when the car had warmed up I, and my passengers, noticed a problem. The vibration was very noticeable in all seats of the vehicle. My rear-view mirror and sun visor was shaking. It only happened when I was idling at lights. As soon as I changed gears, it was gone. 
In the end, I returned it. I love Hondas but this problem needs to be fixed. I know some CR-V's are fine but please test drive for a longer time and ask about this problem before purchasing.",neg
safety equipment is great. only been 1 month. i like it so far,pos
"I would not recommend purchasing this vehicle.

Let me first state this is my third Honda in 25 years. My previous two were well engineered and reliable. To friends and co-workers I always recommended a Honda. But there is something wrong with this model.

Please note I'm not one of those customers to raise holy heck if I find a ""hair out of place"" realizing a car is a very intricate piece of machinery.

As mentioned in the other comments there is excessive vibration in the steering column and into the seat. Both while idling and driving at any speed. It's just plain annoying. I contacted the dealer and their statement is ""we are NOT seeing this problem with other customers"" . That's their line. I recently met a Honda engineer and he stated Honda is working on the problem but can't find a solution.

I know there are always quirks with a car but this is excessive. Additionally, the power outlet to run my GPS doesn't work and now my back brakes
are ""rubbing"". I'm a fairly conservative driver and drive probably 85%+ on the highway. I'm lucky to get 27MPG (AWD-LX). This car is rated 26-33.
It just seems like a non-Honda product. The heater is weak. The radio sounds like a clock radio. The electronic gas usage screen read out. It bounces
all over the place. I have 300 miles left. Ten miles down the road I have 225 miles left. Then back up to 280?

Positives are this CVT transmission is quick. You get the power to jump out when to you need it. We had 7 inches of snow recently and I got around with no problems.

My big mistake is not taking this car out for an extended drive. I was looking at the 2014 models and was leaning toward a purchase after numerous test drives but backed off when I decided to
keep my car through one more winter. It broke down and I bought the 2015 model after a 15 min test drive thinking it was similar to earlier models. I would recommend to anyone to see if you could test drive a car for a half day or more to really get the feel of it before you buy.",neg
"The Toyota Highlander Limited is a fun car to drive and ride. It has all of the most modern safety features including Blind spot, Lane assist, Lane departure, brake assist, collision avoidance, and radar cruise control. It drives very nicely and the steering wheel feels good and is heated. This SUV drives more like a large four door sedan than a SUV. The front seats are very comfortable with heated and cooled options.  The second row is heated but not cooled. The power lift gate is nice and you can open the back window without opening the gate. The only problem so far is matching the EPA gas mileage expectation.
I am updating my review from last September, 2017 when I first acquired this vehicle. It continues to impress me as I am amazed at the ride and comfort it provides. I did not think that it would satisfy my needs so completely. I have a slight physical impairment and driving this car helps me tremendously with this medical condition. I and my family feel very safe when we are in this vehicle. This is the first vehicle that I have ever owned that my wife will take away from me to go on one of her weekend girlfriend trips. We would definitely recommend this vehicle over any other in its class!",pos
"Had the car for 8 hours and it died. The car went crazy and all the lights started flashing on and off (interior, dashboard and exterior). Car would not start. Ultimately had the car towed back to the dealer on a flatbed.",neg
"Wonderful, well built car.  Easy to drive and operate.  Ample truck space, modern electrons.  Sleek design that makes you proud to own one.",neg
"Purchased my Trailhawk several months back. My family already owns a 2014 Grand Cherokee which we love and has had 50k trouble free miles so far. I've mostly been a sporty sedan guy, owned stuff like a 2007 Civic SI, GTI's, 2011 Audi A4 and 2014 Cadillac ATS4. But my hobbies like mountain biking and skiing made it pretty obvious I needed something more versatile. One test drive in the trailhawk and I was sold. The V6 makes solid power and so far has averaged 21mpg in 60% city traaffic, which is only 1mpg worse than my ATS. Handling is spot on and handles bumps and rough roads with ease. Is obviously is not sporty, but the quick steering and lack of body roll make for a entertaining drive. The interior is quiet, very well laid out and the seats are among the most comfortable I have sat my booty in. The Uconnect 8.4 is super easy to use. There is plenty of rear seat leg room even for my 6'4"" dad to sit behind me. The V6 with tow can handle 4500lbs which crushes other small SUV's. It is a beast in the snow and sand and gives plenty of confidence when road disappears. My only complaint is the 9sp transmission is a little slow to shift and too eager to stay in economy mode. But it shifts smoothly. Also the back cargo area is okay size wise, but could be slightly more ample. Love it.",pos
Forest car we could get with a moon roof.  Plenty of leg and head room.  Love the heated seats.   I love the eye sight.  Works great dieting my commute.,pos
"I have wanted a Subaru Forester since they first came out. But every time we went looking for a new car, a different dealer was willing to give us a better price, or different make of car came with more bells and whistles or better fuel economy. But this time we got the Forester and are very pleased that we did. We have an excellent view or the road, we feel safe, the car corners and handles quite well -- albeit not like a roadster -- the trim level has the features we wanted but not features we didn't want, and at least so far, fuel economy is better than advertised. Be warned, however, that you will find what you are looking for in the owner's manual only by accident.",pos
"Great car, my first automatic a real reliable pleasure to drive. For an SUV, extremely comfortable.  Got it for the winter and I have been using it all the time.",pos
"Purchased 2017 Forester in October of 2016 at Bob Moore Subaru in Edmond Oklahoma.  Will never go back.  RUDE.  Heated seats do not function well.  Either too hot or too cold.  Drove an Outback loaner and big difference..much better.  Drove to Denver in December of 2016 with snow and treatments on roads.  My windshield has small chips and speckles all over it.   The car grill, headlights etc  have a few very light marks...the windshield is horrible...horrible. My two other cars, an X-5 BMW and GMC Yukon, which have over 100,000 miles, their windshields have nothing like this and have had much, much, much more exposure to harsh elements.  Something is wrong with Subaru windshields!",neg

"Good news about the rough idle/vibration design flaw---they have acknowledged it exists. 

Bad news? Everything else. There is no word on when a fix will be available. And of course no clue as to what the constant vibrations mean to the long term stability of the car. No urgency because they aren't killing anyone with the car or polluting the planet. They are simply selling a car that vibrates like crazy every time you stop in traffic.

Nice huh? 

I'm a lifetime Honda owner. Have never seen anything like this. A car that can't operate without vibrating --and I'm talking serious vibrating and a rough idle that feels like you are about 3 seconds from a sputtering stop--a car that does that is a nightmare. Cause there is nothing you can do and no one cares.

Stay away from this car!!!",neg
"My car is 1.5 months old, bought new from dealer. I noticed this vibration problem 3 days after I bought the car. I bought it back to dealer one  time with no fix. I just don't know why some cars have no vibration issue or maybe they can live with this issue. But I can't.I thought  Honda should not be selling this kind of  car if they know there is problem. Also I have one more Problem in car when I start car from stop I feel vibration in car for few seconds, I showed to dealer. He told me that Honda knows about that they are working right now on that issue. I spent $30,000 for a brand new car that has problem in a month.

"This is my third Honda. Vibrations started from the beginning and got worst. It is difficult to drive Honda CR-V 2015. My body vibrates, a couple of times I was very close to be in accident. I was waiting on the Red signal and car started acting very loudly. Car also vibrates on ""P"" and when I push gas pedal. In the beginning I though it was my imagination, I trusted HONDA so much. Dealership knew that those cars have significant issue and they keep selling to make profit.",neg

"Purchased a 2014 Jeep Overland end of April and didn't have it a full 30 days before it was in the shop. I loved the looks and the way the SUV drove when originally purchased. However the UConnect screen has locked up, blacked out and froze. One time it froze and wouldn't let me change the volume of the stereo even w/ the knob below screen. These glitches came and went but now Jeep is in the shop bc the whole panel touch screen as well as dash screen flashed errors. It also appears that the parts are not in stock and will take weeks to repair. I'm hoping their resolution will be a final fix but it doesn't sound like it will. All in all I'm not happy with my purchase. This is not reliable and with any new car you expect reliability. I think they rolled out the 2014's before they should have.",neg
"We drove GC Summit and vehicle felt cheap and did not drive or handle well. For starters the interior felt very cheap and finish had a lot issues uneven gaps in trim and knobs that felt like cheap plastic. When we drove it was not very responsive. Surprised there people who are willing to drop 50k when Acura, Audi, Lexus, Infinity, Toyota etc all have SuV in that price range that are far better.",neg
"Pros: Incredible interior which is laid out well. The Uconnect radio is great. Cons: Horrible transmission. The cars shifts poorly at best under 35 mph and lunges through gear shifts. This is intermittent behavior and you never know when it is going to happen. Over 40 mph, it acts like a normal transmission. I have had it in for service 5 times including once with the regional service person. They say that these are the ""characteristics"" of this transmission. I have repeatedly asked if these characteristics would be acceptable in another transmission. It has had 3 ""software updates"" for the transmission already. Filed the ""lemon law notice"". Regional guy stated that this car has a 96% satisfaction rate. You really don't want to be the 4% then.",neg
"After much research I determined that the 2017 Forester was going to be the SUV for me.  And I haven't been disappointed...granted I've only had it 2 and half days.  The stories, reviews and forum posts were more than enough to help me make my choice.  This is not only my first Subaru but is also my first new vehicle.  I have to say that the package I picked (2.0XT Touring in Sepia Bronze Metallic w/Saddle Brown leather interior) is stunning!...inside and out.  The LED headlights are beautifully done.  It is gorgeous!  You WILL get noticed.  It took about 30 minutes for the guy at the dealership to show me all the features.  Acceleration is fantastic for an SUV...and I haven't even been able to test out the turbo yet.  First impressions with how it handles on the open road and curvy hills were I live were impressive...for an SUV.  I read reviews on earlier models about comfort issues in the front seats.  I feel that they are more than adequate in the comfort department on the 2017...remember, this not a sports car.  The leather really helps with the comfort factor, IMO.  One of my favorite features is the visual display you receive with the large, over-sized sun roof coupled with the large windows.  Interior controls don't include anything fancy, but again are more than adequate and reasonable.  The 7"" touch-screen display seems easy to use and is user friendly.  I have not had any problems with Bluetooth with the few calls I've made so far.  I could go on with this review but the bottom line is I'm very please with my purchase.

"We bought the 2016 Pilot Elite in December since we were expecting twins in July. Due to owing previous Honda's in the past we though this was the route to go. Long story short, my wife was 9 months PREGNANT and pulling the Pilot into the driveway when it lurched forward, avoiding the other car in the driveway she went down our front lawn hitting a curb resulting in all side airbags to deploy. She was rushed to the hospital for testing, luckily nothing happened to the babies but $11k in damage. When we called HONDA to explain, there response was why didn't you have it towed to the HONDA dealership instead of the body shop. We got a case open with a lady named Marion, who is a complete IDIOT, finally after arguing with her for an hour she sent a rep to the dealership near me and he too k it for a test drive with me and driving it himself saw that the car tends to lurch forward, came back to dealership and ran a diagnostics and showed me that there is an computer malfunction that they need to reprogram it, after 4 attempts realized the unit is bad and need to be replaced and as I am leaving tells me ""oh we got it to work"". Back to American Honda, the rep Marion calls and says we didn't find anything that was wrong from the report that we received other then a software update. I requested a copy of the error code they found at HONDA and the local HONDA rep kept avoiding the question. If anyone has had a similar issue with there new 2016 Pilot, please post so we can build up a case against HONDA, before someone seriously gets hurt in these SUV's. American HONDA refuses to acknowledge these problems until enough people come forward with it.",neg
"If you can tolerate the seats, you'll love this vehicle. I'd been test driving cars for a couple of months and finally took my wife out to test drive the cars I liked best. We got into the new 2014 Forester 2.5i and she LOVED it just like me! Quiet, responsive handling, smooth ride, and nicely equipped. Luckily we took it on an extended test drive instead of just around the block. After 20 minutes our legs and backs were feeling uncomfortable. After 40 minutes it was just downright painful. The seats are too short, too narrow, and the passenger seat is too high! (my wife also felt like the driver's seat was leaning to the left, which I had never noticed.) We were so disappointed since we loved every other aspect of the vehicle. Afterwards I searched the internet and found that Subaru seats have caused back and leg pain in hundreds of customers. Some of them lost thousands of dollars because they had to sell or trade it in for a new car because they couldn't tolerate the seats. So make sure to take it on an extended test drive. Come on Subaru! Listen to your customers! People shouldn't have to find after market solutions to seating discomfort in a brand new vehicle!",neg
"I've had my car for exactly one week and I am completely disappointed. This is my third Honda and is my last Honda.
Vibration and shuddering after it warmed up and really terrible at idle (stop on D). The vibration is very noticeable on passenger seat without passenger.
The posted MPG is not true. The MPG from Honda website is 26 city/33 highway/28 combined mpg rating for AWD models. Currently mine is only 23.3 mpg combined (driving a little more city than highway).
The heater is weak and has trouble keeping up in cold weather. The back seat takes very long time to get warm. This is really a problem for me because I have kids sitting in the back seat.

"I, like many others, have major issues with vibrations (mostly at idle). I was told by my dealership that I ""was the only one"" that complained of this. However, I went online and see it is indeed a problem with the 2015s in general, not my vehicle. I hope Honda does a recall soon to fix this or I will never buy a Honda again (and neither will my family and friends who experienced the vibrations in my car). In addition, I drive the highway and accelerate slowly with the eco button on, and can't get above 25.7 mpg on the highway.",neg

"I loved this car for the combination of compact size, mileage, 4 WD and towing capacity. I researched it before buying and all seemed great. I like the way it drives and handles...when it works. I have had repeat transmission issues on the care since I bought it 7 months ago. It has been in 4 times and while the service department is easy to work with, the transmission continues to have the same problem where it drops out of gear and sometimes even stops while driving. I was patient with the recommended resolution but after 4 visits and still the same issue it is not safe to drive. They have said that it may need the transmission replaced but will only allow incremental repairs to rule out less expensive fixes before doing so. I cannot take the risk of having it stop and getting into an accident. Cutting my losses at this point.",neg
"Purchased July 2015 - Problems started in September 2015 with navigation and sound system. Navigation screen would go blank - and display a 'Clarion Extraframework has stopped' error.

I have been driving this SUV almost one year. I thought it was best car for me. Spent lot of money. but I am disappointed because of AWD system performs in offroad tests as it was one of the worst performers. I've been loyal to Toyota for many years and now I am really disappointed. searing wheel is not comfortable at all for long drive. interior accessories is very low quality. AWD performance is not good enough. side view mirror is not balance with driving seat. most of the time I can not see while I try to turn left or right. If I could I will return this SUV but probably there is no option in this case. Hope it will help people who wants a good quality SUV.,neg
"I have had to replace the plastic skid plate, broke the first time I was off road, the seat belt,the power window, the gas cover and now the transmission.

Three transmissions in less than 6000 miles. Thankfully we have not needed a fourth. According to Honda the  Bluetooth that stopped working is a problem with my phone not the car... No explanation as to why it worked at first and suddenly stopped. Car still has a high pitched whine upon acceleration only when the air conditioning is on. This was not the case until after the third transmission was installed but Honda Service says nothing is wrong. Still can't trust this vehicle to travel more than a few miles from home.,neg
"Picked up my new CRV-EX-L Mar 7 in Ohio. Drove it the 1065 miles back to Texas that week. Great mileage at 34 mpg highway doing about 70 mile per hr most of the trip. It handled the hills in Ky and Tenn with no effort. Have been getting 28 mpg in the city as quoted by Honda. Has the right amount of power, handles great, and a lot of great comfort features. I recommend the EX - L package for the extras. My only disappointment was lack of a CD player. I also own a Highland which is also a great SUV but the CRV is more nimble. And I love the Honda Sensing safety features, makes it easier to drive.",pos
"It was bad enough that my brand new Grand Cherokee was leaking oil as soon as I brought it home (which ended up needing a full axle replacement).

"After 40K miles the cylinders are shot, no warranty, no help from the dealership for the $1500 repair.  I have never owned a car where major engine work was needed in the first 2 years of ownership.  Don't buy the Honda Pilot..engine is the worst.",neg

This jeep is only 15 months old  and more trouble then the other 2 jeeps I have owned. Never again with jeep,neg
This is the third Honda Pilot that I have owned and it is definitely the best.  It is very smooth riding and handling.  The interior and exterior finish is superb especially the liberal use of leather on the interior.  The complaints that I read about prior to purchase regarding the navigation system are unfounded.  I found the entertainment and navigation very easy to operate unless you object to frequent cleaning of the touch screen.  Conclusion:  Congratulations to Honda.  This is the best Pilot that they have offered.,pos
"After discussion with many jeep drivers, I was excited to get into one. I bought the 2016 Grand Cherokee Limited Edition 75th Anniversary Edition. After three times into the dealership for the same issue, we finally settled on it being a lemon. Here's the problem. The CAM sensor doesn't work and at the ignition start sets off your engine light and other issues. There weren't parts to fix it and had to wait. Finally was able to get into a 2017-same edition thinking it was just this one. After only owning for one week, back in the shop with the exact same issue. They fixed it by putting in new diffusers. I have been back on the road for less than two weeks, same issue has come up again. Two brand new jeeps and the same issue. They say there aren't issues with this edition but seriously, two in less than a year with the exact same issue. I have been patient and trying to work with the dealership on this. I have lost all confidence in the jeep brand. Great to hear that so many individuals out there are having a great experience with the brand. It just must not be for me. Watch out for the 75th edition release.",neg
"Am currently leasing this one...2017 Premium. This is now my fourth Forester. I truly appreciate the small things...IE: The lumbar support is great along with the adjustable height on the seat bottom. The privacy glass is just right.

I don't even know where to start with the issues...
Purchased 3/29/2015- in the shop for the 1st time June 2015 with transmission issues (they claimed it just needed some updates)
In the shop for 2nd time 10/1/2015- still with transmission issues. They replaced the valve body and harness.
Brought car back home 10/13/2015
Had to bring it back to the shop the very next day, almost got in an accident with the transmission issues, my car stalled in the middle of an intersection.
It bucks and has delayed acceleration/gear switching. It kicks itself out of drive while I am driving on the highway. It bucks and stalls in traffic.
Had to bring my car back to the shop 10/14/2015 (as of today 10/23/2015 it is still in the shop with no end in sight) and escalated my case with Chrysler. 
Chrysler and the dealership have been an absolute nightmare to deal with.
All I want is a safe car and to have my car bought back from me.
Please stay away!

Update:
Chrysler did not do anything to honor the car being a lemon. I ended up having to take a $5,000 loss, but am in a Nissan Rouge now and I absolutely love it!",neg
"Our family has leased a new Honda Pilot every 3 years since 2003.Our current lease is up and we went to get a new Pilot. Needless to say, we did not like the redesigned Pilot. Don’t get me wrong, there were a lot of improvements to the new Pilot, but the overall style is more of a minivan than an SUV. The quality of materials is significantly better than our current 2012 Pilot and we like the captain chairs. The one button to move the middle seats is very easy and the camera in the passenger side mirror is very cool!  The ventilated front seats are comfortable.  What we did not care for is the minivan style flip down arm rests on the front seats and touch screen audio system. You can see every finger print on the screen. Our Acura also has the touch screen audio and the fingerprints never go away. It drives me crazy! The touch screen is bit more labor intensive to change the station or volume, so you will be more distracted from the road and traffic. There are controls on the steering wheel for some functions though.  Our Acura also has push button start and both my husband and I would prefer an actual key.  It is very easy to leave the car running, especially how quiet cars are today. The push button transmission selector is in a really bad location. I have visions of a beverage mishap and a very expensive repair to follow. Why the transmission selector is electronic and not mechanical is also a concern. The visibility is very good from the driver’s seat and the ride is awesome. The engine start-stop is something I would have to get used to, although. I really don’t see the saving as the mpg is rated the same as what we get in our 2012 Pilot.  The steering and handling on the new Pilot is a huge disappointment.  The steering is weak with a weird bottom heavy feel and it is slow to respond. The steering does not feel substantial enough to handle a vehicle of that size and weight.  Needless to say it is very unnatural and not something I would want to deal with every day.  The new Pilot has significant body roll on right hand turns, but seemed to be Ok turning left. If you take your turns at a snail’s pace, it might not roll as much.  I am also not fond of the exterior styling. It screams “Me To” as it looks like an expanded CRV.  We have been driving Honda’s and Acura’s for a very long time and have been satisfied and loyal customers, we are now looking at other manufacturers for our next SUV.",neg
"UPDATE: I have had to take it into the shop 3x now. The most recent was the compressor stopped working. Less than 20k miles.
Please do not buy this steaming pile of dog poo on wheels.  My dream was always to own a jeep because I had only heard good things about the brand.  My husband and I needed a larger vehicle before we welcomed our amazing daughter into the world. The 2015 Jeep Cherokee was the perfect vehicle for a very very short time.  This hunk of junk has 15k miles on it now and all of sudden we have a whole host of problems; The jeep well not accelerate for a good 15 to 20 seconds after you hit the gas, the radio/display will not turn on when you turn on the vehicle, bluetooth will not connect, parking brake engages by itself.  For your safety, i urge you not to by this ""jeep"".",neg

"I'm so disappointed with my purchase. Now that I'm reading similar reviews, I see many others have had similar problems. I purchased a 2014 4x4 Cherokee Limited exactly 2 weeks ago. I drove it for two days, less than 200 miles, when the all wheel drive system began trying to engage and locking the wheels up every time I would take off from a stop. It has now been in the dealership's garage for 10 days and they tell me they're not sure what the issue is. The have ordered parts (taking another stab in the dark at how to fix it) which I was told will take an additional 2 weeks to even be delivered to the dealership! Meanwhile, I will have a car payment due at that time for a vehicle I haven't even ran 1/2 tank of gas through yet! My hope is the garage has it for more than 30 days and I can utilize the Lemon Law in my state. Do your research people! I should have known better and chose something different instead of buying this on an impulse. :(",neg
Take your time to go through the process in making your decision. The Subaru dependability and Forester Touring Model is a great combination! We really like this car!,pos
"We traded in our beloved 2007 Highlander for the 2017 because we needed the higher tow capacity. Wow, wow, wow!  We feel enveloped in luxury and comfort. The 2017 has a much steadier ride, top quality materials and is more comfortable and roomy. We owned the Sport version previously because I hated the sloppy body roll on the regular 2007 Highlander. The XLE 2017 has a more responsive ride and corners better, it is much smoother and steadier overall and all of the seats are roomier and very comfortable. Love the telescoping steering wheel, front shelf and pop-up hatch window, too. I am struggling with the new technology, but learning to love and appreciate it fast. The Stop Start system works really well once you get the hang of how and when to use it and is almost undetectable in use.  Some of the climate controls are not intuitive (update-after owning this vehicle for one month...I am STILL struggling with the climate controls...only thing I can complain about really) and wondering why MPH not digitally displayed.   Hoping this new Highlander is as reliable as our 2007!  I am 5'6"" husband is 6'5"" and we both find it very comfortable my husband can't stop raving about this vehicle either. Wow!  Look forward to every drive now!  Update: No issues after a summer of driving and towing.  Towing is strong and steady. 1 year update - Vehicle is great, no problems about 10,000 miles.  Handles snow and ice superb, my old Highlander did not.  Also the 4wd button option has been used numerous times and worked perfectly for the situation for us.  EnTune is the only consistent headache for me.  It doesn't always work well with my phone/Pandora accounts and I have to reconnect constantly (no Pandora music if I don't).  Small issue with rear bumper 'melting' in a small spot near exhaust - Toyota is replacing at no charge.  We love the vehicle, it is perfect for our lifestyle of mountain biking, camping, hauling dogs around for hikes and bikes.....",pos
When our 2001 Forester final wore out my wife said get me another red one.  She feels safe and in control even in the heart of Minnesota winter.  I did buy one with turbo and radar cruise control for me. Great decision still love the car.,pos

"My wife and I test drove several vehicles from different manufactures.  Our last vehicle being a Toyota Camry Hybrid.  That was our baseline vehicle to compare our evaluation with.  The Toyota had great power and gas millage, but had some funky placement of controls (i.e., the cruise control being behind the steering wheel).  We found the Subaru Forester Touring 2.0XE, to be the best at meeting all our requirements.  The most important being Safety, where Subaru has done a great job with their eyesight system.  I particularly like the lane departure features, that will nudge you back into the lane before you cross over the lane marker.  For example, Toyota, only gives a verbal beep with no correction, and for someone who has high frequency hearing loss, you will never hear it.  The only thing I cannot hear in the Forester is the turn signal, however the Outback it was easy to hear.  The adaptive cruise control, greatly enhances the driving pleasure in congested traffic that is always slowing down and speeding up.  I only with it was a little faster on braking when approaching traffic that has stopped, especially in light traffic where it may not have locked on to a vehicle in front of it.  Gas millage is in the lower to mid twenty mpg range using premium gas for the turbo engine; which gives excellent power, especially for getting on to the Interstate Hwy with it's high speeds especially with a short on ramp.  The 360 view cannot be beat, with all that glass; however, we are glad that we had premium tint put on the windows and especially the moon roof, which greatly reduces the heating from solar radiation.  Living in a high desert, the sun can really brat down on you.  The headlights have what I call tunnel vision found on many vehicles these days.  Subaru, has helped with the side lighting, by having the headlights pivot in the direction of your turn, helping with the driver's side vision in the direction of the turn.   Have not had a chance to use or with only limited use, I can not fully evaluate other features yet.  We had most options added, however the cargo barrier is not a pet barrier for smaller dogs, and had it taken off.  This being a turbo, we could nor add several items on the front bumper.  Very pleased with our purchase, will consider another review later after I have driven it in all seasons.",pos
"Vibrations worsening. Purchased my cr-v 2015 at the end of May this year. I started noticing Vibrations not long after purchase. I purchased this vehicle because I had been in a car accident and my 2006 Toyota RAV4 V6 unlimited (which I Miss) was totaled. I owned a Honda Prelude as a kid in The 80's (LOVED that  car) and I thought I'd give Honda another look expecting the quality I was familiar with. I can't begin to describe my disappointment. Every thing else in the Crv 2015 is up to par, but let's face it, the most important is how it DRIVES. I wanted to ignore the initial vibrations. After all the crap I went to due to the accident, I stuck my head in the sand. I thought perhaps it was because of the cvt transmission which is something I've never driven before. Now I know this is NOT NORMAL. The vibrations have worsened. I sometime feel like the car is going to cut out on me and now I'm feeling vibrations in the steering wheel. I noticed that there was a recall back in March of this year after I did some digging. I called my dealership and according to my PIN number, my vehicle is not part of that recall. [non-permissible content removed]. Bringing it in this Saturday to be analyzed.  Let's see what happens. Car has about 3700 miles on it. I'm pretty sure the dealership was aware of this problem BEFORE I purchased it. I am PISSED!",neg
"I purchased this car brand new. Within the first two days the transmission started jerking really hard between gears 1-3. On day 6 the exterior door handle just fell off. On day 10 the transmission got worse and jerked incessantly. It has been in service for 8 days out of the first two weeks I have had the vehicle. When discussing with Chrysler corporation I was told ""It was completely normal and I didn't know how to drive it."" They also informed me they would not be fixing anything because nothing is wrong, however my car is still in the shop to ""not fix anything."" Will NEVER buy anything Chrysler again nor would I recommend any Chrysler product after their ""customer Service"" and ""normal transmission.""",neg
"I took delivery of this car just a month ago, so this is a preliminary review.   I can't comment on reliability, maintenance cost, etc.   I haven't owned the car long enough, but my experience with Toyota has always been outstanding.   Currently, we only have 750 miles on the car, so most of the ""review categories"" with respect to reliability & value that I rated ""OK or N/A"" could not be rated because I haven't driven the car enough.   So, disregard those.   This car for me was a downsizing.   We traded in a 2011 Sequoia SR 5 4WD with 54,000 miles.   It had never been back to the dealership after delivery and was trouble free.   We purchased the car in November '11, after the '12s were on sale, and walked out the door with the $40,850 sticker price Sequoia for $35K exactly.   Anyone who disputes Toyota's resale value, I received $22K for this trade 61 months later and 54K miles later.  So the car cost me $213/month.   I couldn't have leased it for that price.    Additionally, Earl Stewart Toyota in Palm Beach, FL discounted my new Highlander by $2700 off the sticker.   No hassle, no haggle.   What a great dealership!!!!    Now for the Highlander.   The XLE for 2017 now comes with blind spot monitoring, radar cruise control & lane departure warning standard.  These were not available on XLE trim in 2016.   It also comes with start/stop technology & Toyota's new 8 speed transmission.   It cost about the same as the 2016 model that didn't have these features.   The Highlander is much smaller than the Sequoia, (193 inches vs. 205, and a little smaller in width) and is much easier to drive.    There is plenty of space in the front & middle rows.     It is the 3rd row and cargo area where most of the space is lost.   Space it tight back there compared to the Sequoia for any adult no matter how much the front two rows are adjusted.   The only 3 row, mid-sized SUV with a roomier 3rd row was the Honda Pilot, but it's interior design paled in comparison to the Toyota & the advanced safety features I mentioned required taking a high trim level Pilot costing $1000s more than the Highlander.    With the third row folder, cargo capacity is generous, though not as large as that of a Honda Pilot.   As far as performance is concerned, even though we keep the Highlander in ""economy mode"", acceleration is plenty brisk, and there is no trouble merging onto a highway.   Those who report this car is underpowered are misguided.    It's not!!!!    It's not a Mustang GT or  Corvette fast, but next to the Pilot, CX-9, Pathfinder & MDX, it is class competitive.    The interior is very well put together, somewhat elegant, with lots of storage and the leather seats that are very comfortable.   The ride is generally supple, especially on smoother roads, but harsher impacts are a little more noticeable than in the Sequoia.   The back up camera & navigation work extremely well.    So far mileage appears to be better than expected.   We drive conservatively, which helps.   Doing mostly stop & start, city driving (75 to 80% of the time), with the air conditioner on, Tank 1 yielded 21.5 mpg and tank # 2 returned 22.5 mpg.   EPA is 20/26.   The start/stop technology works well, but it can be felt.   So far, We are extremely pleased with the Highlander.   It's perfect for a family of four or five, provided the 5 aren't all adult size individuals.   I'll post an updated review in a few months once we have accumulated a few thousand miles.",pos
"It is apparent that Honda is living in the shadow of their reputation from the 90's and 2000's. We just purchased a fully loaded  EX-L because of the bad reviews of the touring and elite having the 9 speed transmission.  The suv had only 8 thousand miles, and was purchased from a very reputable dealer.  After driving it for a few days, my wife noticed moisture in the front passenger floorboard. When I checked out the vehicle, the entire floorboard (All 4 doors)was completely saturated with water. The next thing we noticed was that the front passenger seatbelt was covered with mold. We took the vehicle to the Honda dealer to get it fixed. I called the service department after 24 hours to see what was going on. The service advisor said it was ready to go. I said wait, what was the issue? He said someone must have hit the button on the remote and made the windows go down in the rain.  I told him that was impossible, because we would have seen water on the seats, door panels, and everywhere else. So they kept the car for a few more days and said they found some seepage on the top rail molding and put some filler in it. He said it was finished and ready to go. I said what about the mold on the seatbelt? He said they cleaned it off, and they would not replace it. I said I was in the mold remediation business for many years, and you cannot just clean mold from porous surfaces. So he said he would talk to his boss. I got a call later from the advisor saying he has never lied to his customers and he wasn't going to start. He said they found a significant amount of water inside the seatbelt retractor.and they were getting an engineer to take the vehicle to a rain machine to do tests, and he didn't know when we would get it back. So a few more days later they found some bad welds or seams under the vehicle, and said they repaired it and ordered new carpet. I ask what about the moldy seatbelt. They refused to replace the seatbelt, so I let him know that we were not going to take the vehicle back. We have a baby, and she would not be riding in a vehicle that we paid $35k for, and has mold and bad welds. We decided to try out a touring pilot since there were no others to choose from. As soon as we checked the carpet on the 2017 touring, it was soaked on the passenger side. That was the end of Honda for us. We traded for a 2017 Toyota Highlander and are very happy we are through with Hondas.",neg
"Is it LEXUS or Toyota ? I bought the 2015 Highlander XLE AWD 3 weeks ago and have 600 miles.

It is difficult to find vehicles for 5 adults and large suitcases to go to airport.  My old Armada will not go into city parking garages. Pathfinder, Pilot, Acura MDX all have less leg room even for 5' 11"" drivers and seats are low,short and narrow. Enclave, Acadia - middle seat does not recline. Highlander quality is better than MDX and Thanks to Toyota for NOT BECOMING CHEAP. But third row is for muppets only. ",pos
I am loving it!,pos
"This is the worst car I have ever had. Coming from my 2006 VW Touareg V8 I feel like I have taken a major step backwards. The car handles like an old Buick and has absolutely no steering response. You feel nothing. The 3.6L Pentastar is noisy and slow. The transmission rushes to eighth gear and G-D forbid you have to merge onto a highway, you need to floor the rattle trap in order to get it to jump down to a passing gear. I can not wait for this car to go back on lease. To add to it the car does not feel safe and is poorly put together. The headliner is sagging with only 600 miles on it and I can already hear creaks. Wish I kept my VW. The Touareg was a real go anywhere SUV, the Jeep is a go-kart in comparison",neg
"Comfortable like an old pair of jeans!! Too early to tell on some issues but having owned a Subaru for the last 6 years I expect ownership will not be troublesome at all. Past service experience has been VERY good. Update 10/4/17. Forester has become a ""Sunday car"" of sorts. Usage will pick up when the snow flies I'm sure. Have not had any issues with fit, finish, operation, or function of any systems or features on this machine. The stadium seating works well for my wife in terms of visibility and allows her to enter and exit with ease. The only service so far has been the oil change. Great car for us!",pos
"I had been driving various rental cars so I knew what I wanted. I liked the wide real window, adjustable seats, digital speedometer, radio controls on steering wheel, leather interior, smooth ride.",pos
the dealer adjusted the head rest. Car is still problem free with great mileage,pos
"I was driving a Toyota Sienna so I was used to more cargo space and a different console setup between the front seats. The console in this car is so big and tall that you could put a baby in it. It is hard to get to the seat belt latches next to it, which means wide people should not buy this car because you will find using the seat belt difficult. I am an average size person and I have to get my hand squeezed down beside the console to unlatch the seat belt.
My audio system LCD also seems to have a bug in it when it is cold. It is non-responsive for up to 15 minutes of driving. You can only change the volume until it warms up--nothing else, no radio station changes etc. None of the buttons beside the panel work either. When it does wake it, sometimes it doesn't beep, but most of the time it beeps and often changes the station to the one at the bottom of the list. Then it might decide to go into Search Station mode. It may beep a number of times and you have to try to stop the Search so it won't replace all of your stations.  Of course, it wasn't cold when I took it to the dealer and they couldn't help me. Every morning and evening is different in how it acts when it ""wakes up"".
It drives beautifully and handles well on snow and ice here in Michigan for the month I have owned it. The third seat will do for kids or small people for a short ride. It is a big step up to get back there.",pos
"I don't know whether other 2015 CRV owners are facing similar issue or not. My vehicle once stopped all of a sudden for no reason while I was driving on highway. All the maintenance indicators of my car like 'Low Engine Oil Pressure', 'Vehicle Stability', 'Tire pressure', 'Battery' etc got switched on and my vehicle came to stop. After several attempts to start it, it finally started after 40-45 minutes. Honda on-road support told that it would take around an hour to reach me, even though I was within the city limits.
The same issue occurred when once I was starting the car. The car stopped within a few seconds of my starting it. After several attempts to start it, it finally started after 20-25 minutes.
This happened twice for my 8 months old car.",neg
"This is the second Forester that I have owned.  It is spacious, comfortable, easy to get into, great visibility, excellent performance. I had tried four other vehicles and kept coming back to the Forester.  It may not win awards for appearance but it gets my vote for everything else.",pos
"I had the vehicle for 3 weeks and was really enjoying it. The size is perfect for my family of four and we were planning on taking it on a few long trips this fall. That all changed when the transmission failed. When pulling on to a rural road the Jeep lurched and didn't go and then it went into limp mode. Luckily we were only 2 miles from home and we were able to get home safely. I can only imagine the hassles if we had been 400 miles from home on one of our trips. The Jeep was put on a flatbed and arrived at the dealer at 10:30am on a Monday. I can only assume the service department was too busy to look at that first day because when I called them at 5pm they told me they would get to it the next day. After evaluating it on day 2 they informed me that it needed a whole new transmission. I was there yesterday (1 week later) and they didn't know when they would have the new transmission. They did provide a minivan rental vehicle that smells like an ashtray. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this vehicle at this time. That may change depending on how Chrysler resolves this issue. We shall see.",neg
"I bought in July 2017 so that I  had something my father could get in and out of easily.  This is the roughest riding vehicle I have ever owned. It's noisy and uncomfortable. I absolutely hate it. Regret buying.  If I could get rid of, I would tomorrow.",neg
"Love the whole Cherokee looks nice, great mileage, handles well, and then there is the transmission I have had it for 10 months and have taken it back 4 times, it stayed over 3 times. I have been told the jerking is normal as the transmission is looking to give me the best mileage, also that the transmission is designed this way and nothing is wrong. The last visit 2 weeks ago they unloaded all of the software then reloaded it and made some enhancements to the transmission, it was great for 1and 1/2 days then back to what it has been doing all along.",neg
"The car is sound, has many safety features. it is easy to handle , runs great in the snow . I drove it home when we had 18 inches of snow. It is quiet and efficient. I would recommend the car to anyone .I feel safe.it has plenty of room and the climate control is wonderful. The heated seats are tremendous. The lane signal is helpful and the blind spot detector, make is more safe .The back up camera is taking me some time t get use to but it is helpful",pos
"In five months I have put over 11,000 miles.  It is a limited demo model  had 5000 mile when bought.  The main reason I bought the forester and not the rav 4 or the crv was the seats, especially the driver's seat.  It is very comfortable yet firm.  I hope I am not jinxing my car but so far the vehicle runs great.",pos
"We have a 2017 Highlander, Limited AWD with the JBL premium sound system.  If you have a choice, DO NOT get the JBL system.  The Bluetooth system is terrible and EVERY phone call has a terrible ECHO making it unbearable to use.  We end up picking up the phone and not using hands free which is a big safety issue and illegal in some states.  I have had it to the dealer 4 times for this, and their final response to me this week was that it was a JBL issue and until JBL fixes it for them, there is nothing they can do.  ""Please be patient with us and we will let you know when it is resolved"".",pos
"After owning five Fords, decided to try a 2014 Jeep Overland. Bought on Friday and took it back on Monday. Got it back a week later and took it back a week later and haven't seen it again. Issues: GPS screen goes blank, GPS screen gets distorted, GPS nav doesn't talk, side car alarm sounds and won't shut off, radio won't turn down or up just stays at the same volume....and the list goes on. Now, if I pull over, cut car off and re-crank, it will sometimes reset everything and work sometimes. Jeep dealer did a USB software glitch update first time I brought it in. Second time they said they were going to have to replace entire system. They've had it this time almost two weeks. Told us today there isn't one sitting on a shelf that they can get and they can't tell us when it will ever be fixed. So it has sat in their garage more than mine. They say the 2013 models don't have this issue. It's only the 2014 models. What I don't understand is why they are still advertising and selling them I'f they know there is a computer glitch.",neg
"I had this car in the shop within the first 4000 miles with rough shifting. Something was done with the PCM and TCM controlls. Have since had it in there 3 additional times for the same issue, one was a warranty recall for the same as listed above, TCM/PCM. One time when I called to bring it in, I was asked if any type of service lights were on. When I told them no, I was told that the car is computerized so if no loght ia on, they couldn't do anything about it.  I was adamant and finally got an appointment. I have had a service advisor and service manager (different times) ride along with me. Both acknowledged the rough shifting. However, when I got my car back they told me they ""checked the codes"" and nothing came up. So they wanted me to come get my car. I paused after failed attempts to get my documentation only to finally getc it and it said ""unable to duplicate the concern."" I called back and requested the documentation from the times the service advisor and service manager did their different rid along with me. What do I get? ""Rode along and unable to duplicate the concern."" Both times they acknowledged my conce but documented otherwise. I have an open case with Diamler Chrysler and that is a joke as well. The case manager is no more interested in helping than the dealership. Not only am I having trouble with the rough shifting which I believe is the transmission I just had to have the struts replaced as my car started making a rattling noise withing the first 6 months of having it. 

This last effort to get my car fixed, I was told it is a computerized car and it will function the way that I drive it. Absolutley waste of my money and time! I have told everyone I can that this company and car is a joke!!",neg
"I bought a Liberty brand new in 2005 and LOVE it to this day. It was time to replace my husband's car, so the Cherokee seemed like the closest to the Liberty we coukd find.  It is not.

A Jeep in name only, we discovered the backseat has far less head room- I am 6'1"" and my head is mashed against the ceiling.  We have a toddler, and there is only about 5"" clearance from the carseat to the ceiling- getting him in and out is very difficult.  This is not a vehicle for you if you need to use carseats!!! 

As much as I LOVE my Liberty, I am so disappointed in the Cherokee.  After only 5 days I am asking O'Brien to take it back.

This is not an SUV, but a station wagon or ""crossover"" at best.  MAJOR BUYER'S REMORSE.

May 25th update:  I had to take it in after only two months due to a loud creaking in the front end.  They had to replace driver's side suspension. When I asked why it already failed the service manager said it probably came off the line faulty.  Not a good feeling for a brand new suv you paid $30k for.

The accerlation has gotten worse and is so lethargic I was almost tboned in traffic when it hesitated on me, even after I put the pedal to the floor. Not responsive even with the auto shutdown turned off.

June 9th update:  back in the shop AGAIN.  Still lethargic acceleration and gear shifting continues to be labored + sunroof ""clinking"" when open  and I hit bumps in the road.  After one day they said they did another software update and replaced two faulty seals.  The sunroof still clinks, but at a lower note than before.  I continued to email and call the sales manager and the general manager, but no response for over two more weeks.  Until today: the sales manager says he didn't get my emails or voicemails for some reason.  He suggested I turn off the auto off button, which I have already done weeks ago, every single time I get in the car.  I responded that I had already tried that and I continue to want to return the vehicle.  They are now willing to discuss returning it but I have little faith that I won't lose my shirt on it - $4500 down and I've paid two months at $435.  Meanwhile, they will reusel it at $29k and lose nothing.  WORST DECISION OF MY LIFE.  I will never buy another Jeep.",neg

As I read reviews today, I see that other customers have reported this 2015 CRV vibrates.  The service staff at the dealership told me that the 2nd gear is ""slow"" and once out of this gear, the car will no longer vibrate, and that Honda is aware of the problem, but is unable to fix this problem at this time.  I wish I was told about this problem before I purchased it.  The salesperson told me today that he was unaware of this issue.  The dealership has been very helpful so far.   ",neg

"This car is my headache since I bought in 2015.  A lot of problems like engine stop suddenly while you are driving; a badly squeeze sound from some where cannot be found by Honda dealership in Montclair, CA, also includes vibration. In this February, dealership told me they can fix the vibration by updating software. They did and vibration degree reduced to be endured. Recently 2015 Honda CR-V recalled for engine CVT problem, I sent my car back to dealership, and was told after updating the software, the vibration problem can be fixed completely. But I disappointed again, the vibration problem comes back, that means it is vibration again like one year ago when I bought this CRV! I hate this kind of vibration which make me irritated while I am driving on the road. So Honda should stop its advertisement "" the best car of 2016"" to mislead customers.


I just bought car in March, and one week late I found the car has vibration problem, and felt a slight jump on the freeway if the car in high speed. I reported this problem to dealership and Honda Headquarter, they said it is under investigation, but without time frame. This problem not only happened on my car. Honda knows this, but they don't want to solve this. They keep saying no safety issue. From Honda's attitude to this problem, who will believe them, and how we can trust them!!! Why we should buy a NEW car with problems! Why should we be suffered by the vibration while driving on the freeway?! Why should we pay a NEW car price to get a defeat car?! It is not fair to customers!",neg
Wanted something higher than present Corolla so that oncoming headlights would be less of a problem. Second reason was had to have comfortable seats as I have a back problem. Bought the 2nd level above the base model for the 10 way drivers seat. Excellent even the passenger's seat without all of the adjustments. Other vehicle considered was a Rav4. I thought I was going to have to go to the hospital after sitting in the passenger seat for 20 minutes. No comparison. Subaru much more comfortable.,pos
This car is perfect for my wife and myself. The best is the safety features and with our 2 year old we love that!,pos
The CVT transmission makes for a driving experience not unlike that of a go-cart.  There is a lag on acceleration and the continuous nature of this technology makes it just dreadful to drive.  I couldn't wait for the test drive to end.,neg
"After having 2010 Pilot Touring we have been waiting for this to come out. With the excitement of it we bought it soon after dealership received them. We noticed the different feel of the transmission from the start but the salesman said they use this same transmission in the Acura's so I thought it was normal and would adapt to our driving habits. But after owning it for a couple months it never did adapt but actually got worse. I had the vehicle looked at to see if there was a new update for the transmission but they said it is normal. I cant believe Acura owners would accept a transmission like this. Needless to say this will be the last Pilot I ever own, looking at trading it in on a Toyota as my wife and I hate this car.",neg
"Alert! Those who want to purchase this car, please test drive it for at least 200 miles :) and go for a decision.  Look for videos and blogs reporting vibration problem in this car. You will find a ton of them. Worst part is that, even though Honda is aware of this problem, it is getting rid of its stock with out fixing the problem. Customers have to go to the dealership and beg for the fix. Dealership is not ready to take the car back. Really disappointed with this purchase. Will never trust Honda. They have performed 4 repairs on the car in the first month. Now that they are completely exhausted with their solutions they are pretending that the car is in good condition now and nothing needs to be fixed.",neg
"Fair warning, this review is long, intended to provide the kind of consumer details that professional reviewers won’t notice in their few hours with a car.  I generally agree with the professional reviews, and if only looking for a 30 second summary, my review is not for you.  We’ve owned our 2018 Highlander Hybrid AWD Limited Platinum about a month now.  Other contenders included a Lexus RXL, Audi Q7, Acura MDX and Honda Pilot.  While never unimportant, price was not the top concern and we bought which one we like the best.  That was the Highlander, including over the luxury brands listed.  Because we were comparing to and shopping the luxury brands, we ended up at the very top trim level possible.  Comments:  We’ve been getting about 25 mpg.  While not the EPA rating, the EPA doesn’t drive 75 mph either.  For a 4500 pound vehicle with over 300 hp, I’m hugely satisfied with the mpg.  While many reviews single out the infotainment center as a “con”, it was a huge plus and primary selling point for us.  I hate anything that looks like a tablet was stuck to the dash or involves a mouse, joystick, wheel or any other weird input method.  The Highlander uses a touch screen, flush mounted in dash, as it should be.  Regarding device connectivity, you can connect both a phone and another device for music (like another phone) at the same time if you want.  Convenient to have the kids DJ from the back seat, while still keeping my phone connected.  The system downloads all contacts, can directly control device music, reads your incoming texts aloud, streams Pandora or other content from a device.  OK, it’s not CarPlay……but I think it’s better.  Takes about a day to learn, but awesome after that.  Toyota, don’t change a thing.

The 5 USB power ports (2 in front, 3 in back) are a big deal and a “must have” for our family.  Not all competitors had this.  The 110 AC household plug is nice too….already used it to keep the crockpot plugged in and warm enroute a Super Bowl party.

At the higher trim levels, the interior is luxury level.  On par with the Lexus RX, better than the Acura MDX in our opinion.  As professional reviewers have noted, the seat comfort is world-class.  By far the best of any comparable vehicle we looked at.

While I can’t disagree with the professional reviews that XLE is the “value” trim level, it’s not ridiculously more to move up.  Limited adds $3K, then Limited Platinum adds another $3K. For perspective, each is well less than 10% of the vehicle price, or collectively, about 15%.   For that, you get the following - upgraded wheels, upgraded audio, panoramic moonroof, surround view cameras, front and rear parking sonar, 2 person memory driver’s seat, power passenger seat, LED daytime running lights, heated 2nd row seats, heated steering wheel, heated mirrors, air conditioned front seats, rain sensing wipers, cargo cover.

To us, it seemed very worth it, especially if comparing to and considering luxury brands.  On the luxury brands, the option packages cost more than that and often don’t even deliver nearly as much.  While not “required”, many of these options are a big deal to us and certainly worth paying for.  We use them all the time.  Heated second 2nd row seats…. our teenagers love ‘em.  Surround view cameras and parking sonar, tremendously helpful.  Driver memory seats – needed for a family vehicle where more than one person drives.  Panoramic moonroof that extends all the way over the 2nd row – kids love that too.  These are great family vehicle options, which is exactly what the Highlander is.

Drivewise, the ride is mini-van-esque, which is a good thing (doesn’t drive like a truck).  Nothing exciting, but pretty much what you want in a family hauler.  While I wouldn’t call it an everyday 3rd row, the 3rd row is very serviceable for occasional use and more than met our expectations.  When folded, it also looks neat and flush.  Some of the competitors didn’t.  

In summary, the family features are what make this car.  Specifically, all the USB power ports, the panoramic moonroof, the heated seats for everybody, the adequate 3rd row, the driver memory seat, passenger power seat, the ability to connect multiple Bluetooth devices simultaneously.  Most vehicles just focus on the driver.  The Highlander focuses on the whole family, especially at the higher trim levels, which is exactly why we bought it.  A month later, we’re still loving it and are 100% convinced we bought the right vehicle.",pos
"Safety technology is incredible, gas mileage is great, love the look and feel of the car.",pos
"I previously had a Ford pickup which I really loved except the gas mileage and my son needed a vehicle. So, as I just went over 200k miles on that - I passed it off to him.
For me, I wanted something that got at least 30 mpg overall, and preferably had a higher ride profile.  So, the smaller SUVs or a Crosstrek. I don't really care about fancy and I don't need navigation, 12 speakers, or a sunroof (not in Florida). I really didn't want anything with a turbo in it - a potential future maintenance issue (which knocked off the Escape from my list). So, I was looking for basic. I test drove several vehicles; last one being a Toyota Rav 4 - which was a nice vehicle but had too many blind spots. Plus, it had lots of bells and whistles I did not need (3 day weather forecast button and 32 station programming . . . what and why?).  So, I went to my local Subaru dealer and jumped in the base model Forester and within the first mile test driving knew this was it for me. So, pulling out various papers; TrueCar pricing, Edmunds and others, we settled on a price. Unfortunately, they did not have one in the color I wanted and I had to order it - no worries though, 2 weeks later and I had it - my first Subaru.
After 14 months of driving, what I really like about the vehicle are the following; the visibility is very good and that was important to me, The handling on very wet roads is excellent (the AWD was not something I was looking for in a vehicle - it is a pleasant bonus), the acceleration is plenty good, the room/storage inside is very good (my dog enjoys it), the maintenance is covered by the dealer for 2 years . . . nice !, the gas mileage is great !! I have actually averaged 35.5 mpg on a trip (all highway). So, lots of good things !
I am a very happy owner. I am averaging 31.2 mpg and my driving is approx. 40% highway, 30% city and the other 30% is country driving (not highway and not city, steady 45 mph stuff, not many lights/stop signs). I have 15k miles on it after 14 months.
The only negative thing I can say about the vehicle is that the paint is too thin!  We have many dump trucks in Florida and they are suppose to be tarped/covered but many tarps are nothing but rags and if you get stuck behind one . . . . and I have, and I now have several little chips on the hood and fenders where the small stones have chipped the paint to the metal . . . yikes. I have waxed it several times and hoping that will keep rust at bay. But the paint is thin. The only other minor issue, living here in the heat, is the overhead storage for the sunglasses gets pretty hot and I now have a ritual to hold the sunglasses in front of the AC vent to cool before putting on (very minor thing as I could put them in a case before putting in storage hold).
Overall, I think the Forester is an excellent vehicle. Gas mileage, visibility, peppy engine, handling is all very good. And it has a very high safety rating. I definitely would buy again and recommend to others. Paint issue, while I think it should be improved by Subaru, is not that big a deal. But, given that it is advertised as a adventurous-type vehicle; camping, nature, pet-friendly, etc. You would think the paint could handle roughing it some.",pos
"I heard a chirping sound in my car the last 2 weeks & made an appointment at the dealership.  They didn't know what it was, but thought it could be the transmission.  They put me in a rental car & called today to tell me that they have to order a whole new transmission for the car!!!  I just bought the car in October & this is such a disappointment! Do not recommend!",neg
"I bought this vehicle with 200 miles. Thus far the only failure has been the radio (control display). I have not had any mechanical issues at all. I would have been very satisfied with this vehicle if it wasn't the poorly designed transmission. It is clumpsy with very slow response during gear transition, particularly while down-shift. This makes the quite efficient 2.4L engine a mismatch. I have read of reliability issues, particularly with the transmission, and thus far that's not the case for me.",neg
"I have owned this car for a few weeks now and very disappointed. I am 6'2"" and don't fit the car. The distance from the pedals to the steering wheel is to short. If I slide the seat closer for comfortable steering my legs are cramped if I back the seat up then my arms are stretched out to reach the wheel. The drivers seat is very uncomfortable and no combination of seat and steering wheel adjustment makes it comfortable. The dash illumination is a hideous red which is distracting when driving at night. There is a lot of road noise that makes listening to the radio difficult. At high RPM it sounds like the engine is going to explode. I have a half hour commute and can't wait to get out of this vehicle each day.",neg
Just bought it! Love the new design. Technology and safety features unbelievable. Very roomy without being too big.,pos
"Ok, I am shopping for a new vehicle and my list is the 2016 models of the Ford Escape, Mazda CX5, and the Subaru Forester.  I added the Forester recently because it looked great on paper.  I've test driven it twice now with the second time with the family.  I thought it felt great, but my wife hated the feel as a passenger.  She felt nauseous because the vehicle swayed and bounced like a ship on turbulent waves.  We own a Nissan Frontier and a Mitsubishi Outlander.  She has no issues with either of those vehicles.  So I put the Forester back down to #3 on my list and will have her test drive my #1 pick before I purchase.  It does us no good if she's queasy as a passenger.  Something to think about if you purchase this vehicle.",pos
"I really wanted a Forester, so I went with the 2014 model but honestly it's been nothing but a disappointment,first Subie was a 2006 Outback and loved it, lasted 250,000 miles when I decided to upgrade,Big Mistake! I had to have the transmission replaced on the Forester at 60,000 miles, I keep having to add oil at least 2-3 times before it's next oil change. The dealer states it should last 6-7500 miles, but its not uncommon to add oil in between oil changes, now the dealer states that the cam carrier is leaking from the left side and needs resealing at a $1600 price, I do a lot of highway miles back and forth to work and unfortunately work pretty far from home so I do put on some pretty hefty miles but I don't know how much more I can take before I dump this car.",neg
"1) Left my wife stranded -- Put the car in reverse, foot on brake, not moving, then pressed the stop button. Car locked her out and wouldn't start. Had to mess with locks and start button for 30 minutes before the car 'reset' itself.

2) Transmission is UNSAFE! -- 9 speed can't find the right gear, car stutters, will LAUNCH you downhill. Low speed driving is terrible, can't maintain a constant speed. Seems like really bad software making gear decisions.

3) Lane assist is DANGEROUS! -- Can't help you at all, will not hold the lane. Hey Honda, either you steer or I steer, but whoever is steering better be really good at it. Steering is NOT a cooperative activity! Don't ""assist"" me with steering unless it can be trusted.

4) So many little software problems. Remembers the seat position incorrectly.

5) Worst entertainment center ever. Seems designed in 1998. Can't use the nav while moving, seriously? I can mess with the radio all day, using the most confusing and distracting software ever devised, but I can't use the nav?

6) The car 'Dings' at uss constantly and randomly. It's trying to tell us something, I have no idea what it is saying. DING .. wait a few minutes -- DING!

"Good vehicle if you live in city.  Not good if you live in country in Wi., Mn., Mi. etc.  The so called AWD system blows.  I live in county.  Driveway has hill.  If driveway has ice front wheels barely enough to get up hill as they were spinning.   Appears back wheels never kicked in. During winter there were times going into town or home and hoping didn't end up in ditch. No confidence in this vehicle. There are no indicators to notify the driver that the vehicle is in AWD.  Driver has no idea when the vehicle is in AWD if it ever is.  Do I really have AWD ? There are 1-2 sentences devoted to AWD in the owners manual.  An AWD light will come on if the AWD system overheats.  Bet this was done purposely(no indicator) do avoid law suit when someone gets in accident when the driver thinks AWD should have been in place when it wasn't.  If you tilt the front seat back to any degree,which you will need to do if you're taller than 5'10"", you cannot fold the back seat down as it hits the back of the front seat.  Have 10,000 miles on mine and looking to trade in.  Good gas mileage.  Average 30-35 on highway.  29.3 overall since owning.",neg

Well we've had this SUV for 2 years now and have had it in the dealership to many times to count! Major issues that are not covered on the extended warranty of course!

"Bought in December 10 2014. After a 2 block test drive I really liked it. After purchase I noticed a vibration in the seats and between1000 and 2000  rpm and a droning noise.

Honda is telling thousands a fix is coming, if a fix is needed for a new car how can you sell them knowing there is an issue, Honda calls it an issue, to a consumer its a problem!

"2017 Jeep Grand Cherokee Overland, 4x4, 5.7L Hemi, all available advanced safety technology. Had for 9 months, 20,000 miles. Decision factors: Real 4wd, flat cargo floor, advanced safety technology, wifi, big enough to put knees at point of impact in most crashes (I was an ER nurse.) and fast enough to be safe getting on highway. Had to be American brand. This is long, but I gained much from other reviews and hope my views help someone else. Considered: Another Tahoe; Jeep replacing 10+yo one that I dearly love, but lack of available flat cargo floor and rough ride sadly put new Tahoe out of running. Mercedes, loved it, was cheaper than Jeep, but insurance would have been 180 per month higher than Jeep. (Or my Corvette!!!) Insurance company said avoid, Porsche, Mercedes, Audi, Mini Cooper and Volvo as all would be high. Hated the BMW, nothing good to say about it. Liked the Murano, but lack of 4WD made me take off short list. Initially did not consider FCJ products due to horrible J.D. Powers quality rating, but after extensive research, on sites like this, I found the GC was not a problem vehicle. I expressed my concern to dealer and I bought a bumper to bumper 100K after-market warranty for a lot less than Chevy sells one. I am not a fan of these warranties, and know they are usually not a good investment, but this one was very reasonable, and from an insurance company I have known of. Hope I dont regret it, but got me over my fears of this brand. (Read update below.) Pros. Advanced safety technology is awesome. Cheap insurance costs. Adjustable ride height is great, because I am short and makes getting in easy. Hemi in sport mode is really fun; just dont look at gas gage. Very nimble, short turning radius makes it very nice in tight parking garages which I have to traverse daily. Flat cornering with very little body roll. Panoramic moon roof makes interior feel larger. Initial fit and finish very good. Overall nice manners, nothing in drive-ability I would change. Controls familiar and easy to use. Good rear visibility even with headrests up. Heated steering wheel great, didnt think needed but really enjoying. Flat cargo floor. Excellent rear camera. Ventilated seats. Cargo area good size for big dog. Cons. Uncomfortable seats. (Seems to be a trend, and all but the Murano had these hard seats.) Gas mileage, I am not using eco mode. (Gas mileage climbing, after 3,000 miles up to 21mpg in mixed driving.) Wants mid-grade fuel. U-Connect; after 4 different techs, finally got iPhone 6s linked, but multiple phones a nightmare. Doesnt consistently work, and sometimes hangs up on callers it doesnt answer when using phone alone when in car. Cant text, cant use voice commands. Tech said not compatible with latest iOS, but were hopeful there would be upgrade soon. (REALLY? Considering the demographics of a GC buyer this is inexcusable. This is the primary reason for my lower overall rating and if I had known how bad it is, since this is my office, I might have chosen another vehicle.) Do not believe CNET review. U-Connect is horrible. Wifi through Sprint; was advised it wasnt very good by tech support and couldnt do what I needed because even with unlimited data it is only 3G and poor coverage. (? Think, know is a lower level service.) Told 2017 GC wasnt compatible with Pandora, even though has app, and after tech support couldnt make work, I was able to make work. Our Chevy is through t-Mobile and as good as TWC at home but does have data limits. Chevys My Link is far better and easier to use. I wish I had bought the stereo upgrade, like Bose in Chevys which is MUCH better. Wish had more ports for auxiliary equipment. Bad blind spot created by driver side A pillar and mirror. Carpet looks cheap. Rear hatch should be operated electrically, and advised not to shut manually, which took some training to get the dog to stay back while it slowly closes, and it doesnt always work. (It is having some issues, but dont know if it is the dogs bed pushing on it or something else I have on the floor causing this.) In conclusion: I am into cars, and wish I was more excited about this very expensive vehicle, but when I am asked how I like it, I respond its growing on me, probably partly due to my expectations. I have to remind myself this is a tool for my job and was the logical choice for me at this time. My vehicle is my office and I have to be able to get to see patients regardless of conditions. Even though very expensive, in my book, it doesnt scream you have money, so if you are looking for prestige, this isnt your vehicle, which is good in my line of work. If you are considering this vehicle, when you test drive it make sure you test it in regular, eco and sport mode. It is three different vehicles. I found out when took delivery of my ordered vehicle it was in regular mode, but I had test drove demo in sport mode. When I changed mode to sport, I was much happier; throatier exhaust notes and throw you back in the seat acceleration. (I did the adult thing and switched back to regular mode when I saw effect on gas-mileage.) Even if the GC is not your final choice, please consider getting a vehicle with advanced safety technology. We are so sold on it after only two months we are considering trading my husbands near new Silverado for one with the technology, we feel it is that important. It does take some getting used to, like trying to get through a skinny ATM lane, but has proven very valuable already. Hope it will be mandatory on all cars in a few years. Update: After 9 months of fighting with FCA about iphone to Uconnect problem, I am trading the vehicle. They just dont care and have admitted iphone isnt compatible with Uconnect even though they advertise it is. My car is my office so this is critical for my productivity.",neg

"Subaru prominently displays, on the console screen, a picture of a car with an arrow pointing toward a gas pump. Next to this graphic is some number of miles, always a multiple of ten. I was wondering if I could trust it and wanted to trust it because it gave me plenty of miles to get to the next State of Washington gas pump which I'm supposed to use. I watched it carefully as it dropped from 50 to 40 to 30. I was about 15 miles from the State pumps when the display went from 30 miles to empty to a series of dashes. Great! Why even include this feature if it bails on the driver at that critical point when gas is running out? I immediately found a gas station and charged an expensive tank full to the State of Washington. And, I drove away with a sour feeling about what is otherwise a decent car.",neg

"Firstly, I have the V6 model Trailhawk.  It was a great car for the first 11000 miles but then one day I received an RO1 recall notice for a software reprogramming.  Don't do it.  This reprogramming disables second gear because they know there is a serious design flaw with the transmission.  The recall reprogramming limits the down shifting of the tranny so you end up with a car that is always in the wrong gear and a herky jerky pig to drive.
  I once rated this car with 5 stars but feel compelled to warn the public now because so far Chrysler appears to be unwilling and very uncaring to restore this vehicle to what I paid for.
Update:
This Cherokee was long ago dumped, traded for a 2016 Subaru Outback 3.6r.  The Jeep was a ridiculous Lemon, an absolute swindle and worst purchase of my 64 years.  The 4WD would always disable and FCA disabled 2nd gear, making it pig to drive

"We have had our Pilot for a little over a month.  We've taken it to Lake Tahoe, and around town of course.  It climbed the mountains and handled the corners with ease on the way to Tahoe.  I'm anxious for winter to come so I can test the AWD system as I head to the ski resorts.  The vehicle is incredibly comfortable (I suppose that's subjective based on each person's comfort level), and the interior is very nicely laid out.  I actually look forward to road trips since we have more room to spread out.  We will probably have the 3rd row folded down 99% of the time.  With that, there is a lot of cargo space in the back.  There is even a fair amount of room with the 3rd row up.  My wife and I have two young boys, and they it is nice that their car seats are far enough away so that they cannot reach each other.  No more fists flying back and forth between the two of them as was the case in our '06 CRV, which we kept since it is a great vehicle in its own right.  The touchscreen radio takes a little getting used to, but it is easy to navigate once you get the hang of it.  We were considering purchasing a Tahoe or Explorer, but are very happy we went with the Pilot. We are looking forward to having the Pilot as our family car for many years to come.",pos

"Update: I still do love the car, however the A/C system leaves much to be desired. I often have to crank it up to 3 or 4 in the summer to cool down which is LOUD and still isn’t even that great. If you have it on head / feet mood, it tends to be inadequate. Would be tough for someone living in a really hot or cold climate. 

I absolutely love my new Subaru Forester. I will be driving this car until I just can't drive it anymore. I've been shopping for a crossover SUV for about a month now. I bought my Forester two days ago after much hesitancy. EVERYONE in the state of Oregon drives a Subaru and I didn't want to be just another Subaru driver. Sometimes it's fun to stand out! But now that I've owned one, I totally get the hype. The car handles well, it's fun to drive and so far it has been good on gas. I've done mainly city driving and it's been between 25 - 30 mpg. There are a lot of choices in the world of crossover SUVs, and I feel as though I drove most of them. This one (for me) had the best driving experience and the best value by far. The mid-trim level (Premium) gets you a lot (heated seats, a beautiful moonroof) and I'm happy that I stepped up to it. 

If you're in the throes of crossover suv car selection like I was for a month, give the Forester a try. Some like it, some don't but the quality, value and driving experience are really top notch.

Update: 3/31/17:  The air-conditioning system leaves a bit to be desired. Even if you have it going on full blast it's not really that adequate, especially on a very hot day. The same goes for the heat. I often need to turn on my heated seats, and the heat to stay warm when it's cold out.",pos
"Year 1: Entire dashboard lights up with warning lights everywhere; stuck in the “I” fuel efficient driving mode. Dealership tells me I am not tightening fuel cap tight enough. This happens THREE times before they detect 2 faulty fuel sensors and replace them. Also, Bluetooth and audio system fail intermittently. Year2: After  Bluetooth system completely  crashes, I am told I am not pairing i-phone correctly and to bring it in and they will do it for me. Once they discover that indeed it is not user error but in fact the system HAS crashed, they reset the software to fix it. Continues to fail off and on. Year 3: Head unit/Bluetooth completely crashes again, they replace the head unit with supposedly updated unit. New unit crashes within 2 weeks. Am now waiting to get this unit replaced so I can dump this nightmare for another not-Subaru vehicle.

"The 2014 Forester was highly rated by all the experts and had a good lease program so I got one. What a disappointment. It does have a lot of room, is reasonably comfortable, and gets 25 mpg but..............I had to replace the tires after 2 months because the car was all over the road if the pavement was even wet. Something about the drive system wears the tires badly too. I had to have a brake job at 21000 miles. The battery is a total wimp, and I have had to be jump started 6-8 times since last summer and now carry jumper cables full time. The heat and AC are both marginal at best, slow to come on and not very warm or cold. Be wary of Subaru parts, I broke a tail light and the replacement cost me $280. New interior air filters cost me $60. When it is time for an oil change you have to use expensive synthetic oil. If I was not stuck with the lease until Oct 2016, I would be rid of this car immediately.",neg
"I have had MAJOR problems with this vehicle and EXTREMELY poor support from Honda in getting it fixed.  I bought this car in December by June, it had 3,000 miles on it and the a/c didn't work - in Texas - in the summertime.  This was the first time I heard ""it seems to be fine to me.  Let's compare it to another 2015 CRV.""   I have heard that phrase EVERY SINGLE TIME I have taken this vehicle in for service.  Each time I have replied ""I don't need to compare it to another.  I know how this car was performing X days ago and it's not performing to that level today.""  Any, I am promptly dismissed.  This exact scenario has taken place at EVERY dealership for EVERY service issue.  And, the service issues have been many: the windshield wipers don't always work, the sound system works intermittently, the dashboard lights work sporadically, the windows leak, and the ever present a/c problems- in Texas. I believe that Honda once made a good vehicle.  I also believe that Honda changed something after the 2014 model year.  Now, anybody I speak with who owns  2015, 2016 or 2017 Honda expresses major disappointment with the vehicle's quality.  I won't be purchasing another Honda.

Only 3 months with car and have had growing concern and increasing experiences with these issues.  After today's incident this car has to go back.  It is not safe.,neg
"I bought this puppy for the harsh winters up here back in Dec 2015 and I am not disappointed. It is like riding on a cloud during normal driving conditions. It seems sturdy enough when having to ride over rougher conditions and when the 4WD is needed. I have had zero reliability issues with it. I know most of the complaints about this vehicle are about the 4 cylinder and I will say...spend the money and get the 6. The engine has plenty enough power that wont leave you stranded while trying to navigate the highway at higher speeds or when you need to step on the gas. I am averaging about 22 mpg overall. This will of course vary, depending on your driving habits. Passengers in the back seat are comfortable as well. The size is good as I have no issues parking it and visibility is excellent, especially as I am a 52 driver. My ex, at 63, borrowed it and loved it.",pos

"I had been looking to buy an SUV for awhile and looked at several. I hadn't really thought about a Subaru, always thought they got lousy gas mileage. But after reading reviews on them I realized they were up there with the other SUV's and beat most of them. I am hoping mine gets a little better but I have been averaging 26 miles in town driving so it's not bad. Haven't really had it on the highway enough to know how it will do on trips. Only had the car about a month now so it should get better. I love how big the doors swing out for easy entering or exiting. Believe me, I researched a lot before I decided to buy this car and so far it meets my expectations. Love the bluetooth and my grandkids love having a USB port so they can play their own music when they are with me.  I hope to get many years of use out of my Forester which is a base model with a few options added.  So far no complaints! I really like how I can see out of all the big windows. For the money, I don't think any of the other small SUV's can beat them. 

Update, almost 2 years later: Getting better gas mileage overall. Lots better on highway (about 35 or 36 sometimes) Sometimes it sounds like the 4 cylinder is really struggling when you step down hard on the gas but it gets me where I need to be and still happy with my Forester! Would definitely buy again!",pos
I’ve only owned the vehicle for 2 weeks so reliability is excellent! Lane keep assist is not great but having Eyesight operating in the background is a reassurance.

I've had the vehicle in 9 or 10 times (for more than 30 days off the road), but only after I hired a lawyer did they finally replace the transmission. They don't value their customers at all and don't support their products - it's no wonder they have the lowest % of repeat buyers among the large manufacturers. The car looks great and has some nice features, but don't be sucked into what I'll call the superficial qualities of the car. The car consistently shifted like a teenager learning to drive a stick (and this car is an automatic). Chrysler wouldn't allow the dealership to put in new parts, but instead kept trying a series of software updates, never caring if it actually fixed my problem.

"This is for the 2016 Limited 3.2 pkg.  Shopped the market segment (Ford Escape, Dodge Journey) and ended with this as a 2-year lease as our daily driver.  The Cherokee fits into a needed niche for SUV folks:  small enough to park and maneuver easily, but large enough (inside) to not feel like a compact SUV (like the Escape).  The leather interior is soft and supple, yet rugged.   Complaints:  (1) where's the inside rear hatch release button?  Please, FCA:  tell me there is one (on a $36,000-MSRP vehicle).  There's apparently only one way to open the rear hatch and that's by feeling around with your middle three fingers under the rear portion of the hatch door and depressing a 4"" wide, flush with the surrounding surface, release ""button"".  And to further compound the annoyance of this feature, the locking mechanism (that locks all 5 doors) is nearby, so if you hit the wrong button you have to pull the key FOB out and start all over;  (2) the ""auto stop"" SUCKS!  I didn't research this vehicle enough before selecting it and had I known about that ""feature"" it definitely would have deterred my interest in going this route.  Imagine stopping for a few seconds, seeing your tach go to zero, then transitioning quickly between the brake and gas pedal and incurring a ""clunk"" as the Cherokee engages and moves ahead.  Plus, it defaults to auto-stop every time you start the vehicle, so it requires you to remember to defeat it manually.  To me, it's utterly ridiculous--to force the shut down of the vehicle in a (vain) effort to increase the fleet MPG for FCA.  I'll be curious to see how many trans issues Jeep will face in the future as the wear and tear related to that very noticeable jerking between stop and take off shaves miles off the already precarious transmission in these vehicles.  Bottom Line:  'So glad I leased instead of purchasing.  Already looking forward to the lease-end, relieved I don't have to find another sucker for this vehicle to sell it to.",neg

"This update was done on October 18, 2017
Soon after I purchased the Cr-V I had a terrible vibration in the transmission area which radiated throughout the vehicle. It took over two years and many complaints to have it ""corrected"". Both Honda and the dealer had a myriad of excuses. Here are the two best. 1. ""It is inherent in the vehicle design"" 2. ""It is just Harmonic Distortion"". It feels like the vibration may be returning. The dealer made the repair but I was told that Honda never issued a Technical Service Bulletin to owners, there should have been a recall. The vibration affected the engine to the point where it stalled several times while I was pulling away from red lights. 
Like most SUV class vehicles, it is neither sporty or utilitarian. It's OK for carrying groceries but if you want to tote anything larger than a bread box or a piece of lumber more than 6' long, forget it. You would be better off spending 30 grand  a small passenger/ cargo van from Mercedes Benz.
I don't like the all touch screen radio it are distracting and hard to use. The audio quality is just OK. The USB ports are located in the console, they work fine but the location is a pain, if you use the console for storage.I do like the rear facing passenger side camera. It illuminates the info screen when the right turn signal is engaged. Can't figure why they omitted the driver side.
This is the first Honda I have owned. It's a plain middle of the road vehicle. Nothing special and I was surprised at Honda's attitude toward a problem that was very common in the 2015 models.  I will see how it holds up, but will be shopping next Spring.",neg
"The Forester XT has been a solid and reliable vehicle for the past two years. It has performed its duty well as a outdoor activity vehicle that has included almost daily trips in the winter to ski, carrying my mountain bike on the tow hitch carrier, and several 500+ mile trips with my family.  The turbo power is greatly appreciated for merging into traffic and passing on two lane highways.  The handling is much better with the addition of a 19mm rear sway bar, and v rated summer tires.  I run winter tires and wheels during the winter months and consider those mandatory for the snow and ice conditions. Overall gas mileage is good, averaging 22mpg lifetime, mostly in mixed driving. I have seen as high as 30mpg on extended highway trips with the speed in the 65-75mph range. Here with the 80mph highway limits, 25-27mpg can be expected.
I changed out the turbo clamps shortly after purchase because the OEM clamps were notorious for loosening up and causing power loss and drivability issues. I check the clamps during the 6000 mile oil change intervals.  No unscheduled maintenance issues over the past two years, just oil and filter changes.  The OEM tires lasted 16k miles with 6000 miles rotation and correct tire pressure, but I do drive on curvy and steep roads so that may have shortened tire life.  I just purchased some V rated performance tires and have really come to appreciate the big improvement in steering feel and overall grip.
Overall, I am very pleased with the Forester XT.",pos

"We are in our late 70s and bought this 2016 Toyota Highlander for trips to see our children and grand children. However, my wife has health issues that prevent us from traveling. The Highlander is essentially a new vehicle with less than 3,000 miles. It even still smells like a new car! We have had absolutely no problems with it--other than it is simply too large for my wife to drive. We are selling it to buy a smaller SUV--probably a Toyota RAV 4 or Honda CRV.",pos
"I purchased one brand new. Left me stranded @ 1,123 miles. A wire was not soldered correctly to the computer and came off. Transmission shifting funny, and lots of engine noise.

"2015 Cherokee Sport. At 215 miles, trans went into limp mode and needed software update, 387 miles, trans cooler leaked and was replaced, 1500 miles recall on seat belts. 13000 miles, check engine light on.....transmission needed to be replaced. On that day we traded it in on a different vehicle. We knew we were not going to keep the car after the warranty ran out, so while we still had equity, we decided to pull the plug and get rid of it! The service advisor told us they have had to replace many of the 9 speed transmissions. I pity the poor guy they sell ours too.",neg
"I purchased this vehicle in January of 2014 and loved it. I drove it as a commuter and around town. After 4 months I noticed the leather seats are not very durable. Average use caused the leather to crease badly, nearly cracking. I've owned several cars with leather and this was the least durable. I have to apply extra leather treatment products to prevent the leather from wearing further. After only 8,000 I also went to get the transmission reflashed. Jeep released an update in May for the transmission. I was hoping it would cure the hard shift from 2nd to 3rd gear. The day after I brought it in and was told there was no update for my vehicle (the service department did not have the most recent updates) my transmission failed. I own the Trailhawk and like the ride. It's very smooth, cruises at a low RPM with little road noise. The interface is great. However, visibility is very bad, the front pillars block a lot of the view while turning. Also, the transmission shifted hard between certain gears then went out after only 8,000 miles. I also hardly got the 25 mpg highway rating for the V6 engine. In addition each Jeep dealership I've dealt with have not been helpful. I would not recommend buying a Cherokee or a Jeep in general.",neg
"The Highlander is big, it has three rows of seats, however it does not feel like a large car when you are driving. The size does make it comfortable for adults, the 2nd row seats have plenty of room even for larger/taller people.  I really enjoy the ""shelf"" located slightly below the dashboard.  It makes a great place to put your phone, glasses, laundry ticket, etc, you get the picture.  It also has a large center console for bigger items.  The onboard tech is OK, the Toyota Entune system has a couple of OK features including notification of txt's and emails - although you cannot read them while driving but you can send a standardized response. You also have apps for Open Table, sports, stocks, movie tickets and a few others.  The stereo, although listed as a premium system is not very powerful and the tone/quality is fair at best.  The NAV is OK to use, the voice activation commands work best for making bluetooth phone calls but using it to NAV or perform other functions is mediocre. The motor sounds fine at most speeds but I do hear a ""whine"" or higher pitched tone from time to time that I do not care for.  Also, the Homelink function is difficult to program.  I have succeeded in getting button 1 programmed but the other buttons are not working.  (I have not contacted Toyota yet on this issue) The pros are the nice size, overall styling and functionality, the cons are a couple of extra noises, avg stereo and mediocre grade leather on the seats. My net opinion, I would buy this car again and would recommend it to you!

Updating the review after 6 months ownership;  I was able to get the Homelink programmed.  Interesting it worked when I tried it and was miles from my garage and used a handheld remote and for no apparent reason the programming took!  The car still gets roughly 20 MPG and have had no ""squeaks or rattles"".  I stick with my earlier recommendation and would buy the car again if given a choice.",pos

"I just bought a brand new Subaru Forester last month and I absolutely love it. I opted for the turbocharged XT Premium model and it has been great: plenty of power, the AWD has been amazing, and the heated seats are a necessary in colder climates. The interior is very functional, with a great amount of room. There could be more space to store possessions in the center console up front. On the first ski trip to the mountains I got to test it in a 2 foot snow storm and it functioned flawlessly. Just what Subarus are made for!",pos
"Let me start with saying that I’m a Mazda guy. I owned 8 Mazda in 15 year period. My wife drives 2016 CX-5 GT model and we love that car. I had 2011 CX-9 GT with to many miles, so it was a time to get a new car. Went to Mazda to see what I can get for cheap, like $250-$300 per month lease. Liked the new 2017 CX-9, but it was to expensive. Then my brother told me that Subaru has cheap lease specials. Same day went to see what will I like. I liked the Outback but it was to slow with 2.5i engine option. Outback is much heavier then Forester. So I end it up leasing 2017 Forester because the cheap lease special ($250 per month tax included. $400 down) and the way it drives. This is my second Subaru. The first was 2007 Impresa 2.5i. I loved that car. Drove 95K miles with zero problems, that’s why I decided to get Forester. So far I’m very satisfied. Good acceleration, good MPG for AWD, very comfortable seats. AWD is a big plus. Good handling, very nice and quiet ride. I love all the safety futures, lane assistance, blind spot monitor and break assist. New entertainment system is awesome; 7” touch screen is very easy to use. Backup camera is OK, low quality when it’s dark. The only concern I have is the towing capacity only 1500lb. I have a trailer with 3 dirt bikes on it. Total weight is 1400lb, so I should be OK I hope))) I drove both 2016 and 2017 Forester. 2017 has a better CVT transition (more responsive), less road/wind noise, better interior and looks meaner))).

"Our new Toyota Highlander with the XLE package has been in the shop even before we received our license plates!  We did have 5 1/2 weeks of ""new car happiness"".  Then, while out of town, the tailgate would no longer close (automatically or manually).  Then the automatic open/close completely ceased working as well.  It is designed so you can manually move the tailgate up and down, but with the latch in locked position and refusing to open, we could no longer secure the door closed.  I removed the access panel for the latch and tried to open it, unsuccessfully  After calling and speaking with service departments at two dealerships and to a Toyota phone rep, we were still unable to resolve closing the tailgate.  In fairness, the service departments did several steps of troubleshooting with me over the phone.  But to no avail, - during our 140 mile trip back home, I secured the tailgate with a rope connected to the locked latch.  I visited the dealership after returning home.  They said the latch has malfunctioned. They also could not open it.  The electronics for the auto opening & closing tailgate and the struts (lifters) may also need replacing. They ordered a new latch and said they would replace one thing at a time and troubleshoot until resolved. No time estimate was given since they couldn't tell how many components would need replacing.  I asked about a loaner vehicle, while the work was to be done.  The dealership said that they don't have loaners, but they do have rentals.  They said they were unwilling to ""loan"" me a rental, because they'd have to bill Toyota for the rental fee.

"I've driven a 2006 Forester until now which I loved, but unfortunately hit a deer (great crash test results, however!) This one has some pros: roomy, great views, love the CVT, peppy, nice radio, but: This car has the worst ride of any vehicle I've ever driven. I don't know how they passed this new suspension. If you have back problems or kidney problems, this is not your vehicle. You will feel every tiny bump in the road. Other reviewers have called the ride 'skittish', 'unsettled', 'jittery', 'tiresome and annoying'. I agree with all of those. It is a very hard ride, very jarring - constantly bumping and jostling, while at the same time rocking side to side. It's a shame because I can't really enjoy the vehicle's many good properties because I am non-stop gritting my teeth with annoyance about the ride. Subaru really dropped the ball on this one. If I had driven it for a while other than a round the block test drive, I would have made a different choice. I've aired down the tires and that doesn't help much.",neg
"I LOVE my new Pilot!  It is comfortable, quiet, and a nice ride.   There is plenty of interior room, and head/leg room, even in the 2nd and 3rd rows.  Good storage between two front seats.  With the 60/40 3rd row split you can put different size cargo in and only give up minimal seating.  The rear 'trunk' space is very limited, so I would suggest installing roof rack bars and investing in a sturdy storage container.  The climate control and entertainment options keep all rows of travelers happy too.  Plenty of cupholders too. One of the issues I have experienced is a seriously over-sensitive front impact safety sense.  It 'screams' BRAKE at you and shakes the steering wheel even when there is no chance for front impact (this is especially true when vehicle is taking a corner to the right and there is a car coming around the same curve on the opposite side).

I brought it back to the dealership two days after to ask for exchange or any option I may have but they refused to deal with anything except to cut-off you a 3K for buy back. I hate those dealership people in San Diego, they are totally liar, they hiding something just to sell their junk to consumers, they are the worst people I ever met.

"Hello. My name is Steve and I recently purchased new 2018 Subaru Forester. Not long afterwards I had a very surprising discovery I would like to share with you guys. Every time you will disconnect your battery you will need to have your windows reprogrammed in order for them to function. It can be done at your Subaru dealership. I did contact Subaru of America representative to confirm everything - yes, windows need to be reprogrammed. And on top of enormous inconvenience it brings - YOU WILL HAVE TO PAY FOR IT! 
I couldn't believe it when they said it. Don't forget - you disconnect the battery not only when you exchange it for the new one.

"I like the car. It was between this or Honda's new HRV.  The 2017 Forester won hands down.  In fact, it works far better than this site (which won't let you paragraph).


[PRO’s]

Other than the cons, I am happy with our purchase of a 2017 Subaru Forester.   I like the various features.

The CVT transmission seems to get the job done just fine. I’m told it may even contribute to the decent milage we are experiencing.

On mileage, we seem to be doing well over twenty-five, which is several miles to a gallon better than our 01 six cylinder Accord.

One of the first things I noticed was how nice and sharp the Forester turns.  I haven’t tested its limits, but it feels you could nearly turn around on an old two lane road.

I like that I don’t have to grope around under the car for the oil filter.

Acceleration with the four cylinder is impressive.  My formerly owned, five speed, four cylinder, 98 Accord hopped right along.  Even with four adults in it and running up a mountain pass.  The Forester feels as if it could compete, for the most part.

The car seems to do pretty well grabbing what traction it can on ice or compact snow.  When my little pickup wants to take a block to get up to steam, the Subaru just squats down and goes on the same roadway, though it does it’s share of slipping too.  Something other than factory provided tires, true winter tires, would go a long ways to changing that.


[CON’s]

The cons are the not so well thought out details, such as the spare tire and the USB access to the radio.

First, the USB port.  Who thinks it was a good idea to put the USB port to the radio inside and at the bottom of the six by six square, ten inch deep console?  Needless to say, trying to plug a flash drive into the port and drive the car is not a good combination.

Second, there is the matter of AWD, a pretend spare tire and no choice in the matter.  Obviously, it’s a good practice to keep all four tires the same size.  This keeps the front from turning at a different speed than the back, which can not just trash milage, but can also trash transmissions.

A good tire rotation pattern includes the spare.  That way, all tires are the same diameter.  If you have a blow out, you can go to the spare.  As it is, you may have to consider purchasing at least two, if not four tires, when one goes.

I didn’t pay total attention to the details and didn’t catch that the radio lacks rear speakers.  I WILL remedy that, because the sound quality from the current system is what it is - barely stereo.  This is not to say the system is not quality for what it is.

As others pointed out, the warranty could be better.

[JUST FOR REFERENCE]

Our previous ride, an 01 Accord, had a lot of trunk space.  In fact, until we put the Forester’s seats down, we could get about three times as much in its trunk.",pos

"Okay, I get it.  Some here hate the 9 speed transmission, and I almost settled for the EX-L as a result of those reviews, but I am happy to report that I ignored those folks, did my own investigation and I am glad I did.  The 9 speed is different, and it takes some getting used to, but it is very, very smooth.  The sport mode is fantastic for movement down steep mountain grades and combines nicely with the new suspension that allows for sharp cornering without feeling top heavy.  It actually corners better than many of the cars I have owned.  On the highway, the 9 speed transmission is as smooth as butter and really delivers an awesome ride.  In town, the 9 speed transmission performs well too.  When I drove the car home from the dealer, I did notice a difference during the stopping, slowing down process.  What I concluded is that the sound of the transmission differs from the normal 6 speed in that it does an audible ""rev"" that in my opinion fools the driver into thinking the car is speeding up.  After a few days of really paying attention, I tried to manufacture a ""rev"" or lurch but just couldn't.  I am not saying the issue is in everyone's head, but what I am saying is that the transmission behaves differently and that the behavior takes some getting used to--just like anything new.  It may also require some adjustment of driving habits too.  I am still feeling it out, and by no means want imply that others' impressions are incorrect.  But I will say, had I relied entirely on some of the negative views here, I would have gotten an EX L, and I would have missed out on the Touring, which in my opinion is a hands down winner.  Not to mention the value gained by stepping up one model!  Just my thoughts.",pos

I have missed driving a sports car but love the ability to sit up a bit higher in a SUV.  The Subaru Forester combines both for me.  It handles like a sports car but has the advantages of an SUV.  LOVE IT!,pos

"This is my second Subaru and I did not hesitate to buy another, now I regret it. After two oil changes in 5,000 miles it started using oil at a rate of MORE than a quart every 1,000 miles. Currently having a oil consumption test but noted the dealer over filled the car by a 1/4 quart when I got home.",neg
"Love the car when I first test drove it. Unfortunately, not long after I got the car, I started feeling strong vibration when I stopped at stop signs and red lights. Went on the web to to find out what's going on, and found that many owners have reported the same issue. Took it back to the dealership and they pretend that they didn't know about it. Eventually, they called me back and told me Honda has known about the issue and is looking for a fix. Too late for me, can't get me money back.",neg
"I have a honda CR-V 2015 only 3000 miles drive.  I felt my brand new car shaken a lot. When I visited dealership, one answer there is normal. How can it be? Brand new car vibration was like 20 years old car. I am very disappointed.
I will never buy honda car at all.",neg
"The paint quality is is terrible. The paint is chipping off like I've never seen before. Every time I wash the vehicle I find new chips in the paint. Subaru says they can't do anything about it. I've never had this issue before, and I've been driving for almost forty years.",neg
"My father just Bought a 2015 HONDA CRV Touring model which is their highest end. The interioir and exterior design are great. However, the ENGINE FAILED after having it only 3 days. The car was bran new and came off the lot with less than 7 miles on it. We traded in our 2014 CRV which we loved for this new lemon. Now we are fighting for a refund to get our old car back but they are not letting us return it. It has now been 10 days.

We noticed vibration in the vehicle at medium speeds (30-50mph) and then some studdering at stop signs and red lights. Turns out there is something wrong with the engine. When we brought the car back they were not surprised, we  are not the first to report this",neg
"I have 3500 miles on my new 2015 Trail Hawk. The check engine light came on. Have only been able to drive the car 3 days in the last month and a half because it's been in the for service.

"We had a 2014 Forester, after about a year wanted to get some upgrades.  After some looking we decided to stay with the forester and get a 2015.  Now after only 13k miles and 8 times in the dealer tech has come to this conclusion on 2 issues.  Issue 1. Our ac fan will not stay on high for more than a couple mins. They have said the car is not designed to have the fan on high for min than a couple mins.  From there on it will cycle from high to about every 2 seconds. Really!!   It gets better. Issue #2.  When you step on the gas the car will not go over 15 or 20 mph for about a quarter to half mile.  I am told that I should not expect the car accelerate continuously.  Due to the cvt I should let my foot off the gas for about 10 seconds then try to accelerate again.  I have nearly been in 4 accidents, I am going guess in the near future there are going to a lot more problems. And of course the bucking and rough idle normal too.  This car is junk.  Do not buy it.",neg
"We leased the 2016 Pilot with the expectation we were getting the same quality as the last 3 Pilots we leased.  This was not the same Pilot we had come to love.  This vehicle is tinny - the vibration and awful performance are staggering.  We recently took it on a 10 hour road trip. It was like sitting on an airplane next to the motor.  As we traveled down the highway I felt as if the hood was going to peel back like a sardine can.  I am hoping the dealership will take the vehicle back as we have just exceeded our 30 day period.  I should have been more aware of the fact there were 3,200 miles on the vehicle when we leased it realizing someone already knew what I was about tho find out.  I would not recommend this vehicle to anyone.",neg
"Since purchasing the vehicle in September 2016, it was seen in the service department in October 2016 for a loud click from the brake (told this is normal) and the vehicle shutting off during idle twice. An update was done but the issue continued. November 2016, I brought the vehicle in because the back seat would move back and forth if someone was not sitting in it (they had to replace the whole back seat) but as I was driving into the service doors the vehicle skipped and tried to die with lights flashing on the dash. Service could not duplicate. December 2016 brought in because the vehicle kept skipping when trying to take off from a stop. On two occasions it completely stalled but service was unable to duplicate. The vehicle also had issues with shifting too early at times and then shifting was delayed other times. Once again issue could not be duplicated. Later in December I brought it back again and was told there was a fix. January 2017 the vehicle was brought back again due to stalling and the multiair actuator was replaced. The issue continued as the service manager searched for an answer until I had enough in October 2017 when it came to a stop for no reason and the vehicle would make a terrible noise in reverse at times. Service along with FCA attempted to fix it but could not duplicate the issue. When I received the vehicle back it now skips in idle, makes a lawn mower sound in idle and when shutting off make a whining noise. I have stopped driving the vehicle and am trying to get FCA to do the right thing via Georgia's Lemon Law. I have done my due diligence following FCAs required steps and they said they cannot duplicate my issue but would give me a good faith payment for my time. I have asked to talk to supervisors etc. but am told that is not their protocol. This vehicle is unsafe and should not be allowed on the road!  I have video of the issues and one of the service agents commented on it having delayed shifting but FCA closed my case and said it is fixed, regardless of the fact you cannot fix an issue that cannot be duplicated. I sent my Lemon Law paperwork over 1 week ago certified mail and now USPS want to send it back because FCA hasn’t come to pick it up. I will not drive my children around in the vehicle and I will never buy another Chrysler product. I love my dealership but FCA has no business making cars.",neg
"Carefully  check dash for deform/bubble on top of dash just to the drivers side of clock. Dealer and Toyota both acknowledged the problem but Toyota claims it won't cover under warranty because others have the same issue. So because Toyota allowed these Highlander's with a dash deform to leave the factory, it's not their problem. Our doors won't lock by touching the door handles. Wind noise is terrible and inside of doors get covered with road dust and dirt due to poor design. We have also had the front bumper pull apart from the fender to where you can see the clips. Manuals are terrible and they are just thrown in glove compartment, no organizer or binder. Long time Toyota owner. No more, they are now crap. They might as well not offer warranty, they go out of their way to avoid to ignore it.",neg
"This is my 4th Subaru. I also had a 2009 Forester and it was a great car.

The Subaru Forester is unstoppable in the mountains of western Washington.
The 8.7"" of ground clearance allows the car to be driven almost anywhere.


The Premium package is simply amazing for comfort and quality.
The Forester is quiet and easy to drive.
Passengers in rear find ample leg room.
The storage is quite good for hauling things.

Very disappointed with transmission and idle /vibration in steering wheel when accelerating and backing out of garage after starting car in morning,neg
"Purchased my 2016 Pilot LX in late July -- what a mistake ; after 300 miles heard a popping noise in chassis / suspension when backing out and steering to move forward - very pronounced; brought in for service and the service rep said it was a bushing; well it re-occurred -- now 1500 miles and it is in the shop again -- guess what -- was told that Honda is aware of the problem BUT while no TSB is out , Honda mechanics tried another fix  with the driver's side wheel assembly and frame ...   will see how this holds up in a month. Otherwise, the LX remains a very good vehicle  ... just that after owning my share of American cars in the '60s and '70s where it was the norm to visit the dealership within a week oe two for defective issues, I have gotten ""spoiled"" in owning good foreign cars where a visit to the shop is only for scheduled maintenance.
Update  12/15/2016- the popping noise has returned -- so much for Honda Quality unless totally built in Japan.
Update  12/16/2017 - been to the service dept twice where an attempt was made to fix this problem -- not successful.. so I bought the proverbial lemon",neg
"As someone who goes to car dealerships often and talks to the service workers, I would NOT recommend this car. Often, the transmission gets blown on it rather quickly, and makes it an expensive fix. When my family test drove one, it was comfortable to ride in. But other than that, its not worth the high price tag they put on it. And for one of the higher (more loaded) ones, its basically the price of the Grand Cherokee, which that would be better to go for than this.",neg
"Bought the car 3 weeks ago. Paid 37,400 on a 40,840 sticker XLE white with leather.Car is comfortable AC is cold both front and rear . Have owned toyota before and played a big part in the purchase.

"Overall, super impressed with the Cherokee Trailhawk v6! With only 1k miles on it so far, I can't think of any cons. Its comfortable, stylish, drives great on and off road and has amazing technology options. Its heated seats and steering wheel, as well as the automatic starter come in handy in the winter/fall months in NY. I would 100 percent recommend the trailhawk v6! Get out and test drive it!",pos
"I have put about 14,000 miles on the car and it drives great and handles well.  The mileage is quite good with about 27 mpg average but on the highway it can get nearly 40 mpg if you keep your speed down.  Engine power could be described as adequate but not really sufficient for mountain driving with most grades requiring down shifting into 4th gear.  Interior room is good and the sunroof is nice but noisy over 55 mph.  I am 6'1"" and the drivers seat does not fit me all that well but my wife loves it.  The rear seat room is much improved over older models and head room is quite good as well.  I would rate the fit and finish as very good, the doors close with precision and a light touch and wind and road noise are low. The sheet metal is very thin and acorns will put dents in the hood so be careful where you park. The 6 speed manual transmission is nice as long as you don't try fast shifts as it will balk or go into the wrong gear.  One thing some drivers may not like is the lurid red instrument lighting.  Red is good as it does not impact your night vision like blue does but it is jarring.

Now the bad and it is really bad.   Major oil consumption issues from new ending up with a quart every 900 miles or so after 5,000 miles.  Subaru did put a new short block in it but the new engine already has been removed to replace a bad rear main oil seal which was leaking all  over my garage floor.  Once that was done it still leaks oil and now the engine pings badly.  The dealer has been unable to find and correct the oil leak.

Update - The dealer in Fresno destroyed my second engine by putting way too much gasket sealant on gaskets which blocked oil flow and DESTROYED the engine.  Subaru of America finally had another dealer install a new engine which has been good so far (about 10k on this engine).

 After THREE engines in 9 months we seem to finally have an engine that runs properly and does not use too much oil.  The latest engine does use a quart or so between changes but I guess I will have to live with it. 

Be forewarned about the oil consumption issue and be wary of certain Subaru dealers in Fresno, Ca!

Update - Complete AC system failure!  The compressor, hoses, evaporator and all the O-rings in the system were leaking.  Fortunately the extended warranty paid for it all but it meant two trips to the dealer to find all the problems.  One other small thing - the cargo light in the rear is a joke. So dim it is useless and it is low down where cargo blocks it anyway.

Update - Can't wait to unload this car. Nothing new has gone wrong since the AC system crapped out.",neg
"there's a batch of 2015 highlanders with a servo which makes an intermittent buzzing. at first you won't really notice because you're loving the new ride, but once you hear it, the sound never goes away. at this point Toyota says the sound is ""normal"", but if you google ""2015 Highlander buzzing sounds"" you'll find a number of message boards with similar experiences. we even purchased the additional warranty on the car, but at this point Toyota and dealerships refuse to admit there's a problem. it's an expensive fix, but they shouldn't have let this batch of cars off the lot with this problem in the first place

When you're test driving, make sure to turn the radio off and keep changing the driver and passenger temperature to see if the buzzing occurs. if it does, run!!!",neg
"I test drove the newest Highlander and other crossover SUVs in the segment was not impressed. I went in very excited and considered the Highlander to be a favorite going in but it was very disappointing. The car itself felt cheap compared to others in the segment and wasn't as smooth a ride. The space was underwhelming as well, especially in the 3rd row. I like the front end style of the car but a couple of angles looked kind of minivan-ish. Was also disappointed seeing how poor the Highlander's AWD system performs in offroad tests as it was one of the worst performers on Fast Lane's test up Gold Mine Hill. I've been loyal to Toyota for many years but I think it's time to consider other options.",neg
"An awesome SUV! It's comfortable and drives very smoothly. There is no reason to choose an European SUV over this amazing machine. I like everything about this car. If I were to change something on this SUV, the headlights should be more brighter and not that yellowish color. The lighting of these bulbs are on the low side and at night I would prefer to have better visibility. Other than that, it's superb!",pos
"My wife and I test drove the; Mazda CX-5, Honda CR-V, Toyota Rav4, Nissan Rogue, and Ford Escape. In honesty the smoothness of the ride is probably tied for second with the Rogue losing to the Rav4. Does that mean its a bad ride? No! The Forester has a stiffer ""sporty"" suspension system but it was much better than the Escape and CR-V. The interior of the Forester is really great with materials and comfort of the seats front and rear. The outside noise isn't too bad to be honest, but I would say it could be a little quieter. There is plenty of space for all individuals. The sound system really is pretty nice especially since it wasn't upgraded or anything. The Forester has a lot of pep for a four cylinder engine with decent power to accelerate when you need and takes hills really well. When it comes to space within the Forester there is plenty for cargo and seems like tons with the back seats folded down. Whats super great is the minimal blind spots! You have such a wide back window and side windows with almost no obstruction to your vision and the side mirrors are located on the door to enhance viability of your surrounding. Subaru did a really good job on the Forester with safety (Look up the crash tests on YouTube if you don't believe me) compared to all other CUV's. Standard AWD is a great feature especially for those with crazy winters. My biggest ""gripe"" If we want to even call it that is the infotainment system. Talk about a pain having to put each contact from your phone in one at a time, yeesh. Most cars sync with your phone once your in the vehicle. Overall, the Subaru Forester is comfortable especially on long drives. Has great get up when its needed. Gas mileage is good! HWY from Southern California to Phoenix got me 32.9 mpg and back was 33.4 mpg (don't hear me complaining about that. Also we love how in the Forester there isn't an ""ECO"" button that chokes and compromises the car like the Nissan Rogue, Subaru just made a fuel efficient vehicle with decent power. If you haven't at least test drivin' it to expand your options, you should as my recommendation. Yes we're at 22k mileage with a ways to go, but hey reliability right? EVERY company has a lemon once in a while, but I have talked to a LOT of longtime Subaru owners and they have all stayed Loyal and loved their cars, so far we do too.",pos

Bought a 2015 Jeep Cherokee Limited in January 2015 in May we drove to Washington DC for a move. While driving the check engine light came on and then wouldnt  go over 35. Imagine driving 35 in DC traffic keeping an eye on the RPMS which was up to 4 RPMs and making sure it did not get hot.  Before we started our trip I took it in to take care of the recall on transmission/ air bags. The Dealership in DC told us we needed a new transmission. We picked it up two days later and while driving home in DC traffic I took a left hand turn and the vehicle automatically turned right. It took all my strength and my husband to get the car to a safe place. Power steering connection wire came loose.  ,neg

"My wife wanted leather seats so we purchased the XLE model, which comes with electronic and computerized everything.  Although we paid for it, we will never use nor did we want 80% of the electronic wizardry that comes in this model.  Lots of computerized stuff equates to lots of opportunity for malfunctions.  The radio is ""speed-activated,"" meaning the volume is supposed to increase gradually as the vehicle speed increases to compensate for road noise .  The radio in our highlander is defective.  The volume erratically and abruptly increases and decreases at any speed, even while the vehicle is idling.  It's enough to drive you nuts.  The vehicle is under warranty so I told the dealership I wanted the system replaced in one visit.  In response, I got a lot of rigmarole about protocol and was told the system would need to be removed and sent off for diagnosis.  I told them this was unacceptable as it meant several 100-mile round trips to the dealership.  To no avail.  They arranged a Saturday morning appointment but then told us they would need authorization to replace the system and since Toyota's technical service office is not open on a weekend, they could not get the approval.  The technician downloaded a software service pack that did not correct the problem.  I called the Toyota ""customer care"" center to lodge my complaint and insist that the problem be corrected in one additional visit.  It was like talking to a trained puppet.  More rigmarole about protocol and ""I'm sorry you are being inconvenienced"" and ""I am unable to guarantee the problem will be fixed on your next visit.""  Protocol before customer service, always !!  The vehicle also comes with ""radar activated"" cruise control.  Although functioning properly in our vehicle, it's the most worthless, vexing thing I've ever encountered.  Who wants a cruise system that slows the vehicle as it approaches another vehicle you intend to pass?  Consequently, I have to manually turn off the radar system every time I use the cruise control.  This is another example of just too much technology that's poorly thought out.",neg
"After hours of combing through Consumer Reports, various websites and test driving SUVs, we chose the Toyota Highlander. This is our 2nd Highlander.  It is our main, family of 4, vehicle. We had a base model 2005 Highlander for 12 years & loved it. It was very reliable as we pretty much only had to do routine maintenance. Our 2016, we purchased, was previously a lease vehicle. The safety features are fantastic. The back seat has captain chairs which my 2, 5'10"" tall, teenagers love. The 2nd & 3rd row has more leg room than our previous model. We only use 3rd row seat for short trips. Overall, the 2016 feels roomier than our 2005. I'm not a fan of the plastic cargo cover in the back. I'd rather have carpet to help keep things from sliding around. Also, the storage center between the front seats is awkward/bulky. The tech features are easy figure out & use. The ride feels smoother & is quieter than our previous Highlander. We test drove the 2017 Honda Pilot at least 4 times & liked it too, but the tech had zero knobs & was not as easy as Highlander to figure out. The Pilot seemed to sit lower than the Highlander & the steering felt looser. In the end we purchased the Highlander, because we know it will be reliable for years to come & we wanted a sportier look.
*Update after 6 months. 
Still love our Highlander. However, I wish the automatic hatch would lift higher. I'm 5'5"" & have hit my head on it several times. I do push it higher manually when I remember.",pos

"Add body side moldings, door edge guards, rear bumper cover and side window deflectors as accessories as most dealer lot models are displayed without.

"My, like others 2015 CRV's vibrates excessively to the point of nearly stalling when at stop lights. This issue has completely destroyed my ownership experience.

You may or may not get a CRV which exhibits this vibration problem.",neg
"This car would probably be fine for me for short, (less than 15 min. trips). The drivers seat becomes very hard after sitting on it for any length of time. Wife drove down to Montgomery, Ala. this wkend and averaged 31.7 mpg @ 75 mph. I guess this is ok for an awd, although it would be nice if that 1.5 turbo was a little less thirsty. This seems to be a quality built vehicle, and it does drive quite nice. The front seats however, are terrible. I also am unimpressed with the audio sound. Honda should have a high-end system in the ex-l.  In summary, I'm glad this is my wife' car and not mine.",neg
"5000 miles on the car and Mode 1 Vibration is evident even at cooler temps.   Sometimes in reveres the car shudders violently making you think its going to stall.  This is a major concern when backing up around sidewalks or busy parking lots as you lose concentration.   Starting to get mode 2 vibration also.   The techs at Honda are aware and could care less.   Guess only recourse it to keep taking it in and the try to fight them with lemon law.  The navigation and the whole setup is counterintuitive, someone really has to clean up the logic here.    The materials on the doors are very cheap and scuff up easily.   Sitting in stop and go traffic and you feel as if you're in an old broken down manual car with a bad engine and trans.   Long and probably last time new Honda buyer.  I hope Honda gets with it and fixes the issues.

Update:   Ended up getting all 3 vibration fixes but it didnt help.   Transmission was whining and surging.   Started to get highway vibration.   Noticed the navigation constantly couldn't find roads.   Power steering started cutting out at low speeds in parking lots.   Driving around the steering wasnt direct.

The seam stitching split on the dash by the windshield and I took it in and was informed by the manufacturer representative that they would not take care of it. This was about a year and a 1/2 ago and the vehicle had about 29,000 miles on it. This is a one owner vehicle that has always been garaged and cared for the entire time. For the record, until Chrysler steps up and stands behind the product, I will not entertain any Chrysler products, including when I replace my Chrysler Mercedes SL550. It really is a shame!

"I believe you're either a Subaru person or you're not. If you appreciate their engineering bias (over styling), great safety reputation and aren't concerned with the hottest gimmics (like LED light accents), you could be a Subaru person... . This is our 6th Subaru product, and we've driven nearly every one of them  over 150,000 mi., on average. The one that didn't make it to the prime of life ended up the basis for a commercial (Outback totaled when it left highway). 

Despite being Subaru loyalists, have to admit there are a few warts to mention. Details that Subaru could do better - get rid of ugly wheels, nicer color choices (like a nice dark blue), fix high oil consumption and reduce engine noise (esp when starting from cold) are personal gripes.

UPDATE: Looks liked Subaru was reading my mind when they updated the 2017 Forester.. . LED lighting accents, new rim choices and added noise isolation - still some rather bland color choices, and no idea what they might have done about oil consumption.

Our '16 Forester has a modest 9000 miles on it, and as expected, has had zero issues with it. Our only complaint about how vehicle was delivered was that dealer ran it through a car wash which slathered ""hot wax"" over windows - which took several attempts to remove. 

The biggest gripe (which may have been resolved since our model) is the infotainment screen and instrument panel. Would LOVE to have a digital speedometer read out (analog unit hard to read), and would appreciate having individual read out for low tire pressure (vs. idiot light). The center screen is a hot mess, with stray hand movements causing it to go into unwanted choices. In addition to being hard to tune/select, have found it impossible to directly tune stations on radio - even contacted Subaru to see if we were missing something... . It's a pain to have to scan for specific station when driving (esp. with Sirius) when it would be relatively easy to enter station numbers.",pos
"I purchased my 2018 CRV new.  I have had nothing but issues with the heat and defrost functions.  I took it back to the dealer four times already and their standard response is that is just the way new cars are now, they don't produce heat.  I have even purchased a thermostat for the interior because there is just no heat.  The ONLY way I can get the stupid car to heat is if I drive it longer than 40 minutes, then it finally starts to warm up around 70.  The windshield is a nightmare, the defrost does not keep it clean of snow and ice.  In this area of Wisconsin, that is a necessity, not an option.  Either I missed this, or the reviews by Consumer Reports and Edmonds are not reporting this defect.  Shame on you, as had I know this, I would never have purchased this car.

Bought our Forester in Nov. of 15.  Our biggest complaint is the very uncomfortable seats.  They are very hard and lack any amount of comfort.  Long trips are nearly impossible with this car.  The electronics are very confusing and difficult to figure out.  We have never been able to get the garage door to sync with the car and the phone to work hands free.  It has been reliable and is easy to get in and out of.  Visibility is pretty good.,neg
"After the first drive and really settling into the car, it is very smooth easy drive.  The navigation system is not that great and I am considering switching it out, but overall I am extremely satisfied with our car.  It doesn't seem to be as heavy as the Honda Pilot that I was test driving and it was the little touches that really won me over on purchasing this car.",pos
"If you are looking for  A reliable around town car that you keep under 45 or 50 miles an hour, then this is a good vehicle. Otherwise this vehicle is very dangerous on curvy roads and on highways. Any attempt at higher speed, 65 mile an hour breaking or turning is quite dangerous. The brakes are non responsive and the body roll is excessive. Additionally, the front seats are horribly uncomfortable, there is virtually no usable cargo space up front and the headlights on low beam give no side illuminations. When you are turning a corner in the dark you could literally run someone over   Simply because you did not see them. Good reliable around town car. Keep it under 50 miles an hour",neg
"Favorite things: 
Fully Loaded with options seen with luxury brands but much lower in cost.
Top Safety Plus pick with the pre-collision safety system (only available on the limited platinum)
Every one loves the panoramic sunroof!
Easy to drive, great turning radius for its size.
Kids love the space in the rear seats.

Things that could be better:
Fuel efficiency has been worse than I expected, running about 17 MPG in mixed use.
Not too fond of the Entune/Navigation system.  We still end up using our favorite map app on our phone instead of Toyota's version.",pos
"I have lived in wyoming-nebraska all my life and driven on snow packed-icy roads with many different cars...rear wheel, four wheel drive cars as well as pickups.  The Subaru forester is the worst vehicle I have ever driven in my life on ice.  You have absolutely no control-it feels like you are floating all over the road and if you go anything over thirty mph.....you are totally out of control.
Shame on you Subaru for claiming to share the love....this car will end up killing people who trusted your company for designing safe cars!",neg
I bought this car brand new and had to bring it back to the dealer with 1300 miles on it for transmission trouble. Over the course of the next 4 months 2 additional transmissions were put in before I reached 4k miles. I filed a lemon law suit 11 months ago and FCA is fighting with the attorneys and refusing to buy it back without making me pay for the miles driven on the car. It wouldn't have miles on it if they had taken it back when I filed the suit. I am being told not to drive it because I WILL OWE CHRYSLER MONEY if they decide to take the car back. This is the only car in my household! It is now worth $10k less than I owe due to carfax report - TERRIBLE - DO NOT BUY!!,neg
I have tried Highlander 2012 for four years and owning this car for 3 months and see that Honda Pilot is above everything than Toyota Highlander. It's definetely best SUV.,pos
I love this model. However I had to replace rear right shock assembly because oil leaking. I noticed that some unuaual banging sound when I cross over some step or safety block. I replaced it and I am happy now. Hopefully no other issues with my brand new car.,pos
"I previously owned a 91 Camry, 03 Highlander, 06 4-Runner and 07 Camry. This time I was leaning towards a 4-Runner, but after taking another look at the new Highlander I decided to purchase. I went with the Limited edition (with Driver Tech package /AWD / Blue-Ray player/ Towing package). I also decided on the White Blizzard Pearl color; which I think is the best looking of them all, second choice would have been silver. I also looked at the Platinum Limited (PL) version however couldn’t find it in White, in this area. The only main difference between my Limited (with my added options) and the PL is the PL has the heated rear seats & steering wheel and the full panoramic moon roof; I really didn’t need either of those options. I wouldn’t get the Limited without the Driver-Technology package; it’s a little expensive but I think it’s got some nice features (mainly safety). The Towing package comes with a heavy duty radiator with oil / trans cooler (nice for general towing or even if you live in an area with a hot climate). Also, the Limited has the JBL radio, the heated & vented front seats and various other standard options, i.e. led running lights, puddle lights, blue interior lighting accents, and various other things (research). It took me a few days to figure out all the bells & whistles. Now that I’m accustomed to this vehicle I’m pretty happy with my purchase. If you want an “all-around” SUV, especially if you have kids, or you will be using it in snow country (considering the AWD option) then this may be the SUV for you. If you do live in snow country you may want to consider the PL model, hence the heated rear seats/steering wheel options; however you won’t get the Blue-Ray for the kids. If you will be doing more off-roading or live off- the-grid then you may want to look at the 4-Runner. At the end of the day I think this was the best choice for us. Did I mention this thing is loaded? When the trial Sirius Radio and the Toyota Safety Connect runs out I will be renewing, I’m spoiled now.",pos
"This is my fourth Subaru Forester purchase as I am a devoted Subaru fan.  This purchase I decided to upgrade from the basic Forester model to the next level up and got the Premium model.  After a few weeks of owning it I love all of the safety items such as side air bags, lane departure warning, and obstacle ahead warning.  Wish it had the blind spot sensor, but not a huge deal for me.  The models is definitely quieter  than my 2011 model, and the gas mileage is much improved.  Comfort, handling, and acceleration are still great.  Love this car",pos
"I am really upset on 2018 CRV Touring. Before buying I did test drive for about 2-5 miles and everything was ok. But after driving car about 50Miles, started to hear very loud noise like a drum noise/rattling noise. This noise is specific to Touring model as stated by dealer. If I knew at the beginning why I am going to spend $35K for a car. Now I have to live with that noise. I strongly advise to new buyers do not buy touring at all.

"I bought a brand new 2016 Honda Pilot EX-L.  I had the SUV for 8 months before trading it in.  The vehicle drove very well and was very comfortable - great for a growing family / large family.  I traded the Pilot in as the vehicle was frequently emitting a gas/oil odor through its front vents.  I bought the Pilot in several times for diagnostic and repairs but the dealer was unable to 'replicate' the issue and therefore did not have a resolution to the problem.  Honda stated they would no longer look at my vehicle given the inability to replicate the issue and suggested I go through arbitration if I was still unsatisfied.  I unfortunately went through the arbitration process and lost badly given Honda's experience in dealing with these matters.  Honda changed its position regarding the issue, stating it was a common issue and the car should be emitting such disgusting/hazardous fumes - noting this was not a defect, but normal.  (The change in Honda's position was a result of me getting a 3rd party mechanic to verify the issue.)  I was very disappointed with my ownership experience and have realized that companies don't care about their customers, just their bottom line (should have known!).  Also, the radio is terrible on the Pilot (I think the company is working on resolving this issue).  The touch screen doesn't have a volume button, which I didn't think would bother me, but became pretty annoying over time.",neg
"I bought a new XLE AWD 4 months ago to replace my Sienna mini-van. The Highlander is more comfortable and handles well. However I find it disturbing that no matter how I drive the mileage varies less than 1 mpg. It does not matter if I drive 55 or 75 mph, run the AC or not, or drive in the city or on the highway. My mileage stays at 21.1 to 21.5 mpg. I do not have a lead foot when accelerating, There should be more variation in my mileage.",pos
The Nav. system is a total disaster to the point of being a danger to use.The seats are like concrete and the passenger seat does not articulate. the remote start has no range and works maybe one out of ten tries. The Hwy Mpg is about the same as my 400 hp 2012 Ram 5.7 Hemi PU and worse than the 5.3 v8 Envoy we traded in.The tire pressure monitor has no gage. No oil pressure gage or volt meter? What is this 1959? Dome lights put out about 2 watts and the factory hitch looks like it was put in with a chain saw. Radar cruise control or the manual resume takes a week to regain the loss of speed. We just returned from a 2000 mile trip in this brand new car and my wife and I have never hated a car more. I have owned at least 25 new cars in my life and have never been so disappointed. I do not care how much it cost. This turd is gone!,neg
I have bought many new cars. All I can say is that this is on of the best I have ever owned.,pos
"Honda & Honda dealer does not care about you, they have your money & tough. I drive with a sign on the back of the car.  The new car radio is crap dealer say's it's fine                  
  9/30/2017 spoke .with Walter a regional case manager, he said there is no fix for the sound system. I do feel it is the radio because I can play my 30-year-old walkman transistor radio through the car speakers and it sounds good. Honda is still putting them radios in 17 pilots and crv.I also filed a claim with the national enter for dispute settlement and 2 weeks before the review Honda offered me 4 hundred dollars to withdraw my claim and the next week they went up to 1,750.dollars and they still said it works like it was designed.",neg
The car was about three months old when the transmission was replaced and within six months it was back at dealership for same problems. All the same problems still exist one week later so it is back to the dealership. The car has less than 3 thousand miles on it.,neg

"The vehicle basically started falling apart at 4,000 miles; multiple trips to the service department at the dealership, out of the last 6 months it has spent 38 days (and counting) in the service department. There is something wrong in the electronics/software with these vehicles. Jeep & Chrysler offer no help - in their own words ""we cannot do anything"".",neg
"After 6 weeks of driving the Honda Pilot Elite, I have a growing concern that the user interface to the electronics package may be a safety concern for drivers.  I am very confident that Honda builds a safe vehicle in terms of physical structure, air bags and collision avoidance technology, but there is a ""huge"" distraction issue with the center stack of electronics (nav, audio, RES, cell phone).  My concern is the drive must spend an inordinate amount of time interacting with the center stack touch screen.  Is is very cumbersome and has many layers to accomplish simple tasks.  To make it worse, after several touches on the screen, the finger prints show and if the sun hits the screen a certain way, you cannot see or read the information on the screen.  I spend way too much time interacting with the screen when voice commands would accomplish the same thing in a more efficient and ""safe"" manor.  The same principle applies to the RES (rear entertainment system).  In order to play a DVD for a child, you must put the DVD in the center console, stop the vehicle, get in the back seat and use the rear control remote to start the movie playing.  You cannot do this from the ""Rear Audio"" screen that shows on the center console.  How inconvenient and dangerous (stopping on the side of an interstate highway) is this?  What little voice activation has been provided by Honda is really useless.  It is very slow and you usually end up using the touch screen which is not organized very well.  I am really shocked at how little effort was put into the design of the electronics package.  Again, this is a very ""unsafe"" system given the amount of time and effort the drive must expend at the expense of paying attention to the road!",neg
"I wrote 2 letters to Honda about the vibration they keep replying to me it's a feature of the car.. I never get a written letter back only voice mail.. DO NOT BUY HONDA BOYCOTT HONDA.. They screw a lot of people on a car and they won't buy it back because it's not a ""safety"" issue.. Car was fix the only way to not feel it is to use headlights.. I buy a car and I get a lemon I WOULD NEVER EVER BUY HONDA.... no body even the lemon lawyers won't help.. God bless America.. Going back to American cars I will never buy Honda again. Also cheap car I wounded how many beer cans they use lol",neg
"There are a lot of great things about this car, but there is one showstopper that should prevent you from buying it.  When you are idling at a red light, the car vibrates like one of those funny exercise machines from the 40s.  It also rattles like you wouldn't believe during acceleration. 

This is my 6th Honda and my last.  Honda admits it's an issue, but don't really have anything encouraging to say about a fix.  

My brother opted for the Mazda 5 and he is very happy with it.  If I could exchange this car today, I would.

"Transmission is horrible with the 6 cylinder engine. Very unpredictable and bad shifts (late, early and rough). The problem is very apparent going from 1 to 3 gear with violent jerks. It is unacceptable that Jeep can get away with such a horrible transmission in this day and age. Its a slap to face for the consumer when the engineers stated to the press that people are experiencing problem because of ""how Americans drive"" indicating that they have no intent to provide any type of meaningful fix. There is no way to correctly accelerate without horrible shifts or getting stuck on a gear. Around 4000 miles, my transmission when into a safety mode, locking it to one gear. Overall, it was very stressful to drive with transmission, not knowing when it will shift and if you will have enough power to accelerate. The violent shifts will definitely cause reliability with the engine. Replacing the transmission doesn't resolve the issue since they are all the same. Adding salt to the wound, the resale (KBB value) was terrible when I decided to trade it in at 11k miles. I will never purchase another Jeep/chrysler/fiat in my life time.",neg
"We finally bought a new Forrester. This was the time, the price was right, and the Forrester has grown up in to a beautiful, functional, and sized-right car perfect for young or old. We love it so far, my wife barely lets me drive it. She is very happy and calls it ""her dream machine"". The visibility is great, the ride comfortable (although the seats could use a little more cushiness), and my only problem is driving in high winds. You feel the weight and excellent traction beneath you, but the car is subject to some windage due to its height. We love the car and our only reservation is that the gas mileage is not as advertised.",pos
"At this point I would not recommend this vehicle.

Let me state first this is my third Honda. My first two were a civic and a CRV. Held each from 12-15 years. I couldn't say enough about the quality and service from Honda. Repeatedly recommended
them to friends and co-workers.

But this 2015 CRV has serious issues with the vibration coming through the steering column.
The best description is if the driver side tire is bad. The vibration is very noticeable in the steering wheel. Then somewhat
in the seat.

Didn't I notice while test driving? I tested the 2014. Ready to buy then I heard the about the improved 2015's coming out. With winter I bought the car too quick. Big mistake.

"LA little over a year ago we sought to replace our 2007 Toyota Sequoia.  With three growing children, we needed a larger SUV and wanted something more fuel efficient than the Sequoia. The 2016 Pilot seemed like a great choice with a fair amount of cargo space and really cool features. Thought we were lucky when we were one of the first to own the new Pilot in July 2015 but turns out we were not so lucky after all.
The good:
Technology galore: state of the art transmission that shuts off at stop lights to save fuel, side mirror camera, back up camera, adaptive cruise control, lane departure warnings, accident collision assistance, multiple USB connections, memory seats (I’m 6’4” and my wife is 5’4”)and a touch screen radio with XM radio that has memory and allows me to pause and replay songs. Oh, and whenever I change the channel, it brings me to the beginning of a song currently being played so I don’t have that feeling of “darn, just missed it!”.  Fantastic highway gas millage with up to 36 mpg on a 120 mile drive into the Poconos and finally, very easy access to the third row for my 8 year old.
The bad:
Second row space was not as roomy as I thought and my 6’ teenage son constantly put his knees in the backs of the driver or passenger. Lane departure is flat out annoying with the wheel shake while taking a turn a little tight (sorry, I am an aggressive driver).  Fuel door wasn’t flush to the body of the vehicle.  Fingerprints all over the radio screen.  Adaptive cruise control SLAMS on the breaks when it is not necessary and when driving on a winding road and there is an approaching vehicle on the other said of the road, the Pilot detects that we might have a head on collision. Idle stop did not always work and sometime heisted when starting back up at stop lights. 
The ugly:
My wife HATED this vehicle. Too much technology for her and every so often the radio sound “flickers” and the only remedy is to shut the car off completely and restart (terribly annoying). We even had a couple of occasions when the radio/nav screen was completely blank/off. So while the technology seemed exciting, it needs work. Should have known better to buy a new model. Guess we just expected more from Honda. 
The result:
A year later we traded the Pilot in at a loss for a used 2015 Sequoia Limited which I should have done in the first place. Would have saved me $7K but that is how much we disliked the Pilot.  Seeing the transmission problems so many people had, glad we took the loss and moved on.  It is a shame because we pretty much owned at least one Honda since 1996. That streak came to an end 20 years later and not sure if/when Honda will be our choice again.",neg
Meets all my needs for my work roomy up front and more than enough storage space. Take off is outstanding handling is quick response.lightning is some of the brightest I have seen.Takes the off road very good ground clearance is good for the average drive off the beaten path,pos
"It would be nice if reviewers stated what kind of driver they are and what expectations they had going into this.  For these purposes, I'm a fairly laid back driver.  I drive about 5mph over the speed limit, under limit when conditions are poor, and just like to enjoy the ride.  I'm short (5'6"").  I'm not a road warrior, don't  weave in and out and use my directional.   In terms of expectations it's how I get from one place to another.  No expectations about style or performance.  I'm an advocate from a ""keep it simple stupid"" school.  I do expect to be able to drive capably and safely on the highways, about 80% of the time.  I need it to be my ""go to"" car for my passions , hiking and skiing.   It must be competent on forest roads, logging roads, unmaintained roads, generally what I call ""soft roading"".  It must be capable of handling deep snow, icy, slushy and cruddy roads in the depths of the winter.  It must be capable of hauling all my trail maintenance tools (I volunteer with the US Forest Service).  It must be capable of jamming my skis and gear into it.  It must be comfortable to drive in the depth of the winter colds.  That means heated seats and a good defroster.  It must be able to navigate through heavy snow, which means fog lights.  It must be able to drive through 8"" of mud on dirt roads in the spring.   It must have enough driver's visibility to peer over the heights of land on old forest roads.  It must be ""maximum man, minimum machine"".  It means being close to nature, with great visibility and terrific sun roof, all year.    It means great fuel economy and lower maintenance costs.  It means the longevity of 200K miles or 10 years.   I came from an Audi Quattro with far too many gadgets and features.  Very capable in the winter, with AWD and snow tires.  Problem is, something is always breaking and each repair is costly.  Problem is too low a ground clearance, too great fuel (and oil) consumption.   My first and last  Subaru was a 1981 GL with real 4WD, up/low.   I've taken the Forester down the forest roads, used the Xmode and been quite pleased with how it handles the steeps.   I love being able to put the seat up as high as I can and seeing great distances.  This is very helpful not just on dirt roads, but in seeing wildlife and anticipating the terrain ahead.  I'm no longer fearful of road construction portrudences.  I'm quite fine with CVT.  It's worked quite well under all conditions.   I can't wait to get it in the snow in three months.   It's a car I don't mind getting dirty.   I'm an empty nester, usually hauling only myself around with my gear.  Sometimes one other person.  I would not consider this as a family car.  I'd be looking at an Outback or something else.  While I love Jeeps, I have no need for a larger engine or towing capacity or lower reliability.   Didn't care for the RAV4, CR5 or other competitors for one reason or another.  For me, the non negotiables were sun roof, heated seats.   I don't understand the whining about the rubber mats is all about.  I put dirt-laden picks, axes, saws and other tools in back.  I'm always tracking gravel, dirt, mud and snow into the car.  They are just fine.   If you want a city car with lots of luxury, there are plenty of choices for you.  Just go for the LandRover if that's your style.  I could care less about passenger seat adjustments or a lighted vanity mirror.   What don't Iike?  Mostly small things like more storage compartments, a better stereo (I wil change that out some day), more trunk lighting (I can fix that myself) and a full size spare tire.)  I'm glad it has the roof racks for hauling things like a canoe.  I like the rear spoiler, but it makes putting a bike rack on the back near impossible.    I love the ground clearance.    I love that it's pretty narrow, which makes city driving and parking a breeze.  BTW , I disabled all those beeps and light flashes when the car is locked and unlocked.  No need to draw attention to myself.  I've noticed that trying to stream music via bluetooth in the car results in poor audio fidelity.  Connecting it by wire give much better sound.  For the record, I get 34mpg on trips if I keep it at 60mph.  At 70mph, the mileage gets down to 28, which is about my city driving average.  I've got my snow tires and am ready to rock.  Until then, I'll be on forest roads and highways.",pos
"I considered many different vehicles including other crossovers as well as large body on frame SUVs (Land Cruiser, Ford Expedition) but settled on the Highlander because it offers great utility and people carrying ability in a platform that is relatively fuel efficient (20.5 mpg mixed/24 mpg highway) but still offers moderate towing capacity.  First the good:  Great fit and finish, solidly built, very high quality interior (many parts would look at home in a Lexus), smooth engine, great acceleration for a 5000+ lbs vehicle, roomy 2nd row seat, drives like a compact SUV, great projected reliability and 5 year residual value.  And the not so good:  3rd row seat is tight for adults (wouldn't plan on adults in the back for a road trip), no LED/HID headlights available at any trim level, no Apple Carplay/Android Auto, Navigation looks somewhat dated, infotainment screen hard to read in the sun or with polarized sunglasses, 8 speed auto has occasional rough upshift.  Overall I am very pleased with the Highlander Limited Platinum.  It has almost every bell and whistle and is a very comfortable and easy to drive vehicle.  I'm hopeful it lives up to its reputation for reliability.",pos
"I traded in my Toyota Sienna for the Highlander XLE AWD. I was concerned about losing too much space, but I didn't.  I do miss the sliding doors.  It was nice not to have doors in the way when you're loading and unloading kids.  If you've had a mini man, you will understand that.  Drives so smooth.  Far less road noise.  With my radio going, I feel like I'm in my own little world.  The broadcast radio doesn't sound super, but when you play from bluetooth or XM, it sounds great!  I opted for the black leather interior.  it's stitched with brown thread and there's also some brown leather accents on the doors and dash.  Super stylish, manly enough for my husband, but still very chic for me.  Love the screen!  Wish I was able to add my own apps to the entune suite (like Spotify) since I already subscribe.  You cannot access any of the entune apps without subscription.  Bummer.  Back up camera is nice has a wide angle. Something very important to me since I've have had two cervical fusions and my neck does not crank around easily to back up.  This is a nice helper and makes me more at ease.  Think we got a decent deal and I love it.  If I were to change things, they'd be very minor.  Happy with my purchase!!",pos
"I hope it doesnt.  In fact I hope you read this, avoid buying the 2016 (or 17) Honda Pilot, and avoid the same mistake our family made.  When my wife and I test drove the 2016 Honda Pilot we were not terribly impressed with its acceleration but that was not why we were looking at a new Honda.  We were looking for something reliable and Honda has had a great track record in that regard.  So, even though we were not over the moon about the Pilot when we test drove it, we thought this is going to last 10+ years and is, therefore, a wise purchase.  Boy, were we wrong!   One problem with the Honda Pilot is the 9 speed transmission.  My 1972 Chevelle shifts smoother than this.  When you drop this Honda in drive first thing in the morning, the first-second gear shift will try to separate a few vertebrae... it is brutal.  Once warmed up, this transmission is better, but still not so good.  Especially in stop and go traffic where you will experience many times where the transmission seems completely out of touch with the throttle, leading to ""rev rev rev... wham!"".  You *will* need a chiropractor if you have to drive in stop and go traffic with this machine.  Also, this transmission has a history of early failure already.  However, that transmission won't be the thing that kills you.  The Honda Sensing system will.  Lets say that you are on a highway going 70 mph when someone going 20 mph slower than you pulls out 3 car lengths in front of you.  In that situation our Honda Pilot will SLAM on the brakes HARD causing anyone behind us to weave desperately into the adjoining lane or shoulder to keep from hitting us in the rear.  Or lets say that you are going around a bend on a country road, the Honda Sensing system gets confused and again SLAMS on the breaks in the middle of hard bend.  Lets say you survive the Honda Sensing system... will you be able to survive the throttle?  Lets say you are in stopped trying to turn left across rapidly moving traffic.  You need your car to move when you step on the gas.  The Honda Pilot will occasionally toss in a 5-7 second delay in response time, just to add to the challenge.  Did I mention the $200 oil changes?  This is because, in our case, about the time we needed to change the oil, the ""B16"" code would be thrown on the info system, indicating that the rear diff also needed to be changed.  This prompted the service manager at our local Honda shop to exclaim, ""what is wrong with these new Pilots?!""",neg
"Transmission problems make this a vehicle to avoid.  My 2015 Cherokee (6 cyl, 9 speed transmission)  looked great inside and out, and handled nicely. However, the powertrain was a disaster.  The engine, the transmission, and the Auto Stop/Start system seemed to have declared war on each other, and the result was a vehicle that made any journey an adventure, in a bad way.  It would shift into fourth gear by about 30 mph, then never be able to find an appropriate gear.  The transmission's nine speeds should be named clunking, hesitating, surging, hunting, grinding, freewheeling and ""3 overdrive gears that are never used"".  Its transmission was replaced at 900 miles, and started showing the same symptoms at 3000 miles. The vehicle had three recalls and 9 overnight stays in the dealers' repair bays in six months.  It was one scary ride.  This review is written in the past tense since I sold it to  CarMax  last month at 3200 miles and bought a 2016 Mazda CX-5 (which I love so far).",neg
"The Highlander used to be one of the best rides around, however, the latest version is a real kidney shaker. This may be fine for those who wish to tear around corners, but it's brutal on a long distance drive. Although the Limited version has better suspension, it still falls short of the earlier models.",neg
"Best car I've owned in quite a while.  Great Gas mileage, excellent exhilaration and just fun to drive car.  I drive almost 70 miles a day both city and tollway and with the technology and accident avoidance systems on this car it really makes my commute easy.  It's very comfortable to drive and easily fits my associates, two of us who are over 6'4"" and large framed.  Will definitely buy again.",pos
"This is the only vehicle I've ever owned that I've enjoyed more than my '69 El Camino. The roominess is perfect to those long drives to Florida from Virginia and the suspension seems incredibly smooth. Also, it has 5 USB chargers which judging by the lack of bickering between my grand kids, is a great thing for keeping them pre occupied on their I-Andriods and bluetooth players. The engine is also smooth as silk and has the peppiness I need when pulling out into Florida traffic (people drive like animals)!",pos
It needs a new transmission! The new transmission finally arrived at the dealer two weeks later as of today. Now it will be another two weeks before it is installed because the dealer has only one mechanic that does transmissions. Totally not acceptable.,neg
"I purchased a 2015 CR-V in April of 2015. I have always had Honda vehicles and have never been as disappointed as I am right now. On this past Friday afternoon, I got into my CR-V in 96 degree weather and my AC was not working. I immediately called Honda and made an appointment for the following morning. When I got home, my husband, who is a mechanic, checked it out just to see. He said the compressor was working and the belts were all running. So the sensor was sensing freon. Well we got to Honda the next morning, waited for 2 long hours, for them to say a rock or something hit my condenser and all my freon leaked out. And, of course, MY WARRANTY DOESN'T COVER IT. It will cost me $400 to replace all of this. They did offer a $100 discount since the car was so new, however, I asked how a dent in my condenser that is smaller than a dime could take out my AC in the 3 months I've had it. They said the condenser is made out of aluminum and is very fragile. There is NOTHING guarding this on the front of my car. I called the Honda Customer Service in my warranty book. The woman I spoke with flat out refused to reimburse me as well. I understand that an act of nature CAUSED this.

"Horrible...20,000 miles. The battery has died. It shakes in idle and I already have to replace the tires.  I never had these problems with other cars. I have been to the Honda dealer three times and they want to replace with a compact. I bought an awful. DONT BUY",neg

Would recommend this car to anyone looking for a SVU. Had a 2011 Highlander and this one 2014 is such a great improvement. Nav system is far better and can do a lot more with it. Ride seems to be smother than older models. Gas mileage is also very good.,pos
"The Forester is larger, that is, taller and more spacious feeling up front in the driving area than is the Outback. It also rides higher and feels more like an SUV than does the Outback, which rides more like a station wagon to me. So, it depends on your personal preference. Both cars increase in cost as you go up the TRIM scale. I got the basic model of the Forester. It feels solid, reliable, and safe. Just the kind of vehicle I was looking for and know that I can rely upon for years to come. Very happy with my purchase.",pos
Have the XT and it is worth the money. Plenty of power and the driving settings are very fun. Have been in really deep snow and never got stuck. Lots of cabin space and leg room front and back. Love the CVT transmission. It's as smooth as can be. Eyesight works well and is very nice in traffic. Heated seats are great. Sunroof is huge. The navigation system needs to be improved. I also don't understand why the rear does not get its own set of air vents. Highly recommend​ this car.,pos
"I purchased a 2015 Jeep Cherokee Altitude Edition. The Jeep had 4,500 miles on it when purchased and was owned by the dealership. The Jeep was only 6 months old when I purchased it. I purchased this vehicle for my wife for dependability and weather since we live in Pennsylvania where seasons vary. After one year I received a phone call that my wife was broken down on the turn pike and the car stalled out. We had it towed to the nearest repair shop. It simply ran out of oil. No leaks, no nothing. Just burned through it. I topped it off, and noticed it burned over 1 quart every 1,000 miles. Ended up taking it to the dealership and had an oil consumption test. I was not expecting them to tell me I needed a new engine, but that was exactly what they said. Engine had severe scorn marks. Took 4 weeks for the engine to be installed, provided a rental. It was covered under warranty. I got the Jeep back two days ago and it is back at the dealership because of a very loud humming noise coming from it as I drive it. After this is repaired we are strongly considering getting rid of the Jeep and trading it in and never purchasing a Cherokee with a 2.4 mopar engine ever again. Engine replaced at 24,800 miles. First sign of damage was around 19,700 miles. Took 3 weeks to schedule an oil consumption test. Only reason why I feel it deserves two stars instead of one is because of the hospitality I have received from the dealership.",neg
"I purchased this car 12/31/2014. I thought I was making a good decision even though my 2012 had a leaking roof. I will say my experience with the car and Honda has led me to not buy another car from them again (which sucks - their cars are usually great!). Within 6 months of buying the car, the car would make a creaking/groaning noise when I would make turns at low speeds under 45 MPH. Dealer said they could not hear it. 11 month into owning this car - the vibration issue began to occur. As many people have commented on - the maximum vibration occurs when you are stopped at a light in D with your foot on the brake. It is so noticeable that my passengers have said things about. There has been times I can be at a light and the vibrations radiate up my leg. The passenger seat will shake so much you can see the headrest moving. In November 2015, I had the TSB work done for the vibrations but honestly it still occurred. By March 2017, I was basically in the dealership for 6 weeks straight trying to get the creaking noise fixed. I had video after video of it. They replaced the steering wheel, a rear strut (why?), welded some frame spots, and it never went away. I ended up going to arbitration with Honda - which honestly is not so fair when Honda pays for the program, chooses the arbitrator, and chooses the dealership you bought it from/had it serviced from as the spot of the hearing. I lost the case but filed a suit in Georgia state court (must file in the county where the company is registered and in Georgia it is Glynn County). Anyways I won a settlement and took the check and vowed to not buy another one. Had the vibration and creaking issues not occurred I would have kept this car for a long long long time. The gas mileage was fantastic I could easily average in the 30's going to and from work. The original brakes and tires were still in great shape after I traded it in at 49K. The cargo space is pretty decent. I will say the infotainment is a little lacking - but most Honda's are not the most up to date in that department. Maintenance was pretty much oil changes and tire rotations. The battery died just shy of the 3 year mark, which was a little disappointing. The headlights have always looked good to and I liked the LED strip in them. The engine performance was a little weak but I would expect that if I am getting 30+ MPG, it would be a little more tame than other motors out there. I did like that there is a huge network of Honda dealerships so you could shop around service. Most dealerships tried to take advantage of me trying to push services that were not required by the maintenance minder. I would recommend doing your research before setting foot into them. While I did have some good moments in the car, I am glad it will be someone else's problem now!",neg
Bought my car in may and it already needs a new part.  I was now told it will end up being over a month and a half until it's fixed. My remote start doesn't work due to the check engine light being on.  I lease this vehicle and half to make a payment on something that is technically broken and not working right. Was told to suck it up and there's nothing they can do about it.,neg
"I bought a 2015 Honda CRV Touring in December of 2014.  I noticed the vibrations shortly after buying the car.  I have 12K miles on the car now.  The vibrations have gradually become worse, and I'm getting extremely annoyed by them.  It's not only at idle when the vibrations occur.  It's also at any speed while accelerating gradually.  The whole car shudders, the vibrations resonate through the entire car, and my entire body.  They seem to get very bad at highway speeds (70+ mph).  It's to the point where I dread driving this car, and I dread pressing the gas pedal at all.  It's by far the worst driving experience I've ever had, especially for a new car (that I paid well over 30K for).  I have finally had enough, so I'm going to start voicing my frustration.  If I could get a refund on this car, I would in a heartbeat.  I'm hoping Honda finds a solution, but I'm certainly not holding my breath on that.  I have debated posting this, because I know all these vibration complaints will kill the resale of 2015 CRV's.  So I may be stuck with this lemon for a while, unless I want to take a huge monetary loss on a resale.  If Honda can't come up with a fix, or compensate the CRV owners in some way, this will be my last Honda ever.

I should note, if not for the vibrations, I would be mostly happy with the car.

Since I'm here, I'll make a few other comments on the car.  I don't like the low beam headlights.  They have a very sharp cut-off line on top.  It makes if very difficult to see on rural roads, especially those that are curvy and hilly.  On some hills/curves, you can only see 20 yards ahead.  I don't think this is an issue specific to CRV's though.  Other Hondas, and other makes of cars, also have this sharp cut-off line.

The Collision Mitigation System (CMS).  This is the system that (supposedly) detects a potentially collision, and will warn the driver via an audible warning, light breaking, or heavy breaking.  I was driving to work one day, going around a curve to the right on a two lane highway, with traffic coming the other way.  Out of nowhere, my CRV beeped, and applied light breaking.  It scared the crap out of me.  The CMS radar erroneously detected a potential collision, because of the angle of the curve I'm sure.  If I was on icy roads, this could have sent my car out of control.  I was tempted to disable the CMS system (you do have that option via a push-button on the dashboard).  I have not disabled it yet, but if this happens again, I will seriously consider it.",neg
"I cannot believe some of these reviewers who just accept that their CRV has a vibration to it. I have owned a lot of new cars in my life and do not accept a vehicle that vibrates as a ""characteristic"". I have taken my issue to CAMVAP (Canadian auto mobile vehicle arbitration) as my wife gets ill from the vibration on long trips. Do not buy this vehicle!",neg
"Try it out , you will like it, insurance rates are likely to be lower too,",pos
"I would not recommend for anyone else to buy a $50k+ SUV or car that is an electrical hot mess. the radio, navigation and entertainment system do not work properly even after an update was done by the dealer recently; it's 9 speed transmission makes noises when changing gears specially at around 27 to 30 MPH; it also some times while driving down hill with your foot on brake wants to accelerate rather than slow down... (not sure if it just another electrical problem and the dealer told me they are not sure is the noise is coming from the transmission)  the dealer has not been able to find out what the problem is after 2 days and over 150 miles of test driving it; now they have a field engineer from American Honda coming to take a look at it.",neg
"We have already taken it on a long distance trip and just as around town driving, it excelled. We have had several Honda products previously and they have always performed and handled as expected. The Pilot handles wonderfully both on the road and around town. Even when we put 8 people in it and drove on mountain roads I was impressed with both the power and handling. Returning home, fully loaded with luggage, three adults and two bulldogs, a/c running, we averaged 32 mpg on the first tank and 29.5 on the second tank. Plenty of room for us, the dogs, family children while roaming around town too. Feels luxurious inside and handles great!",pos

"Seriously losing confidence in Honda's quality. I've owned 2 cars in my lifetime.. both Hondas.. and both have glaring defaults within. (Previous car: 2001 Honda Accord, which came w/ a bad transmission)

The 2015 Honda CRV came out of the dealership lot driving great. I thought I finally scored a great deal of a car! Then I started reading about the VIBRATION issues the car supposedly had. The car still drove well for another 10,000 miles.. But now, I'm near nauseous at every stop light I find myself at. I look over at the passenger seat, which is shaking madly.. which means that the driver seat I""m sitting on is also shaking likewise. This shaking at idle reminds me of the transmission issue I dealt with in my previous Honda Accord, where the car constant risk of shaking and dying upon acceleration at eery red light. 

I certainly hope Honda does something about their problems with the 21015 CRV. They received incredible ratings and reviews upon initial release and rode it all the way to best seller. This is very unfortunate that the car does not deliver up to value and no has many (and priorly non-returning) customers.

This car developed a clunk in the front drive train or suspension at about 3000 miles.  Of course the service department can find nothing wrong with it.  Honda is behind it's competitors when it comes to interior design.  Less leg room in the front driving compartment, controls are dated, other companies have lessen to their focus groups.  I think Honda miss the boat here.  Blind spot camara is useless, who looks at their center screen when changing lanes.  Really missed the boat here when comparing them to there competitors.

"I decided to make this post in regards to my recent issues with Jeep. But first I would like to start by saying that I love Jeep. I have had quite a few,  and I love the wrangler and always have. Fast forward to my current situation. I purchased my Jeep Cherokee in March. 2 weeks after I bought it I was taking it to the shop for hard shifting, and bucking. The dealership told me they just needed to ""reset"" it. So I went along with it. April its back in the shop and its worse this time. Take it back and again we ""reset"" it.  May came and the cars engine light came on, it stalls out in traffic and I almost get hit trying to take my son to school. Intake it back they say there is nothing wrong and they reset again. So this month my engine light came on driving to school. Took it to a mechanic and they read the code and it was the transmission. I had had enought I took it to the dealership and called Jeep. Everyone at Jeep in customer care was wonderful. The dealership told me it was a lemon they replaced parts and the engine light is still coming on. The GM of the dealership called and even told jeep it was a lemon. The mechanic, the service advisor everyone told them. So i got escalated in my case with Jeep. The case manager Ashley is the nastiness person I have spoken to at Jeep. She refused to replace my car, told me lies about things the dealership said, and she even told me she would fix my car several time but I was not getting a new one. I told her yesterday that my car is unsafe and i refused to drive and pay good money for a car that does not run correctly snd is unsafe. She said well thats not my problem you aren't getting another car. So i proceed to ask her ""so you want me to drive my 4 year old son around in an unsafe vehicle because Jeep will not replace me with a new safe working car?"" She said ""yes that is what I am telling you. I am sorry but if I do get in an accident with this Jeep I will be holding Jeep personally responsible as well as Ashley from case management. When I explained to her everything I was told by the dealership and the customer care and she went on to tell me that they were all misinformed and she was the only person whos decision mattered. She lied about what the GM is saying about my car and I know this because I have been speaking with them every day. I will be continuing to post this issue on the internet and social media until my issues are resolved to my request for a new working product. I love Jeep but this Ashley person has made a very bad impression on me as to the jeep name.",neg

"I've driven the wheels off this car in the last month, 2 semi-long road trips for family events. I thought about keeping it parked but it's such a nice drive on the highway, I couldn't imagine leaving it in the driveway. This is my first SUV or crossover, I'm coming from a 2011 Mazda 3 5-speed, so I was a bit nervous about the transition to CVT. The shifting is taking time to get used to, but she will get up and go when I need it. The RPMs are usually low when I look, ~2k cruising but up to 6k if pushing it extra hard. The take-off is lacking but I knew that when I weighed the cost of ownership for the turbo; that said, she'll do what you need her to do. The noise is very low this year and it's noticeably so. I listen to audio books which can sometimes be difficult when doing 70mph. The interior is relaxing overall. The visibility makes me less nervous about driving such a big thing and the controls are easy. The navigation is absolutely fantastic and the bluetooth has worked flawlessly. The headlights that turn with the steering wheel are AMAZING for country driving and has helped me see deer in the road. The automatic cruise control and break assist is equally as fantastic. I can honestly say that the break assist may have saved me from rear ending someone already! Within the first week! The car behind me pulled to the side it happened so very quickly! The ONLY con I have really is the automatic headlights. These things make no sense and basically do whatever the heck they want. If you have automatic headlights turned on, you cant override and turn on the brights without holding the stick back. Seriously, WTH!? When I'm coming down by suburban street late at night, I like to watch for my neighbors cats and such but can't turn the brights on without either turning the headlights to manual or holding the stick.",pos
"A great value, safe car. I live on the side of a Mountain. The grade going up my drive is probably 60 degree along with a few curves. The car has amazing down hill assist to negotiate down steep hills and of course my drive. AWD and  4 wheel drive additional feature: just tried in the snow on my steep drive and did not slip once. I would highly recommend this car. I had 2  VW Touareg's, but they were not as reliable on the roads I travel as the 2016 Toyota in snow, ice and mountain terrain. The things I do not like about the car: I am 5'4 and getting positioned in the car means I am constantly moving the seat back and forth. When it rains, the configuration of the door and windows does not shed water when door is initially opened,  steering is so fine tuned you don't feel the roughness of the road consequently ---takes a little getting use to...finally... I would like a more realistic back up camera  (not a fish eye camera )- positioned where the rain drops and snow  do not sit on camera lens distorting the backup view. But as far as safety, I will deal with the insignificant to enjoy the significant safety features.  I need Safety first.

"My last highlander was a 2008 Limited and had 130,000.  The only repairs it ever had were new tires and brakes.  I am hoping this one is the same.  I love the automatic high beams, cruise control that adjusts to traffic, and the bluetooth.  The touch screen is easily navigated and home screen keeps all the important and most used apps at your finger tips.  My sons love the heated back seats and the headrest mounted DVD players (dealer installed but not made by Toyota).  I was hoping for more interior room, the MPG is also not great at 19-20 average (and most of my driving is on country roads, not stop and go traffic).  I thought after 8 years Toyota would have done a little better.  Also DO NOT get Toyota installed remote start!  It only works from about 20 feet from the car.  If you are inside and the car is outside forget about it!  It also shuts the engine off when you get in and you need to restart.  But overall, I LOVE my new Highlander!",pos

Unfortunately the company has become complacent like GM once did and we all know how that turned out. The brakes on the Highlander,the Tundra and Sequoia are horrible when it comes to the wear and tear and they will NOT stand behind them.

"This is our third Pilot.  One of each body style.  This is by far the most comfortable with more driver and passenger leg room.  The rear passenger space is much more comfortable also.  The rear cargo space isn't quite as wide or as tall as my 2009 Pilot but it seems adequate.  My wife misses the lower shelf storage area the 09 Pilot had but overall she is very happy.  The one feature I dislike the most is the Auto idle Stop feature.  I wish they had it default to off instead of on. Every time I start the car I have to disable it because I don't like the slight hesitation there is when you start from a stop sign or signal.  Maddening quite frankly.
One problem we have with the car is the plastic face of the navigation screen.  It scratched easily.  We have always used the supplied microfiber cloth to wipe away fingerprints.  Recently we used it and it scratched the face of the unit.  The face isn't replaceable and you would have to buy a entire new unit at great expense.  Honda should have used a glass face or have a replacement screen available.  I have since used several scratch removers that have partially removed the scratches.  I then purchased a screen protector that cuts some of the glare and hence the scratches aren't as visible.",pos

"Do your homework; both Consumer's Reports annual car review edition and Car and Driver research was helpful.  Also, test drive the competition's products as well;  for us, the Subaru Forester beat all the others when it came to visibility, ease of getting in and out, value, amenities and dealership relations...
Initially thought the CVT transmission might take some getting used to, but, in fact, its so seamless neither my wife or I give it a second thought.  My only pick is that I wish the fuel cap was on the left (driver's side) instead of the right.
Okay, now, after having owned the car for a little over a year, we still think we made the right choice; other then routine oil changes, we have had no issues with the vehicle or the servicing dealership (Hodges Subaru).  In our opinion, the Forester is still a strong recommendation.
We now have about 22,000 miles on the Subi and we are still very happy; the vehicle is still tight and, for its size, the handling is excellent.  However, a small pick... the air bag indicator light on the upper console stays on all the time to show (I guess) that it is functioning;  it's distracting and unnecessary (especially at night)...",pos
"A good deal of research and positive reviews in favor of Subaru is what moved us down the path to purchase the Forester.

Although the local dealership and salesperson seemed quite knowledgeable they could not get the Mirrorlink system to work even though all the software on both my phone and the vehicles's display unit (Heads-up) are compatible. I suspect using Google Maps for navigation will continue however I will also continue to work with Subaru on the Mirrorlink system.

I am seeing a lot of negative comments but if you are expecting a Mercedes GLE for under $35000 then you are dreaming. I bought Pilot LX 2016 for my wife while we own a 2011 Toyota RAV4.

"I can't seem to get anywhere with customer care so I am going to share my story in hopes of saving others from my misfortune with the newly designed Honda pilot. I bought a 2016 Honda pilot last February.  Last week, my air conditioning began to blow warm air.  I took it to a Honda dealership for a diagnostic assessment assuming that whatever was wrong would surely be covered under warranty with a car that is barely a year old.  I get a call stating that they aren't really sure and it may have been that a rock hit my condenser and that is not covered.  The dealership stated  that they see this all the time and it is in ""a vulnerable place at the front of the car.""  I have hit absolutely nothing and have never even heard of such a possibility happening on any other car I have owned.  The fix is $1200 on a basically BRAND NEW CAR.  Please others be aware of this design flaw in the new Pilot and purchase something else.  This is the first and last Honda I will ever own as I have been let down and feel as if I have been swindled by the company.  The employee said that the condenser does have a screen which meant the pebble must have been tiny.  So, apparently the tiniest of pebbles can take out an entire air conditioner in a Honda.",neg
"I initially reviewed this car on Aug. 8th, having owned the car for 1 month (see ""Good Styling and Function, But..). At month 2, my review has worsened, having had to bring it in for service twice due to faulty computer issues and transmission problems. The computer issues have been minor compared to others I've read, but are annoying nonetheless. My radio presets are there one day, gone the next. The NAV screen freezes on an area, and the clock stops keeping time. More annoying is the transmission. In regular transmission mode, the car will jump from 1st gear into 2nd gear at slow speeds (like bumper to bumper traffic on the Washington beltway) or in a parking lot, even if you've come off the accelerator. It also slows too abruptly when coming down off of higher speeds. In general the transmission in this car needs to be reworked. And even though Jeep is aware of the issue that consumers are having, they say the transmission is working properly. My advice is to hold off purchasing this car until they get the computer and transmission issues resolved. I will try to give another update in the next month or 2.",neg

"Was considering the 2.5L  normally aspirated engine and but I am so glad I got the 2.0L Turbo.  This SUV is quick and fun to drive with a 0 - 60 in 6.3 seconds.  Those reviewers who have said it is not I doubt actually own one or neglected to read the owners manual which describes how to use the SI Drive system to choose Sport Sharp mode for maximum driving fun. I know it was a struggle for me to find one to test drive since only 10% of Foresters shipped are turbos.  I have had the Forester XT for over a month and have not regretted a single day of driving - in sun, rain, snow, sleet and really bad ice.  Nothing stops it.    See the SubaruGlobalTV channel on YouTube  for the development videos for this current generation Forester which detail how the engineering is brilliantly executed in a well thought out design (Why? Subaru Episode....).  I got the Eyesight package and really appreciate all of the features.  Only disappointment is the Navigation system but it is bundled with Eyesight.  There are so many features in the 2.0XT Touring trim level with Eyesight  that I would insist on having in any future vehicle  - adaptive cruise control, lane sway warning, lane keep assist, pre-collision braking/throttle management, adaptive LED headlamps, reverse automatic braking, X-mode...the list is extensive.   If you are fortunate enough to get the Touring with turbo, add optional Eyesight and are willing to wait for a custom order (in my case, 3 months), you will not be disappointed!  To top it off,  Subaru was offering very competitive financing (0% at 36 mos or .9% at 48 - 63 months) and deals at or below invoice are common.",pos
"I bought this suv to replace my 2015 QX60 that was totalled in an accident. I considered everything from Audi Q7 (in the midst of a model change and more expensive) to MDX,Pilot,Lexus GX,etc. I like Infinitis but did not want to spend more on replacement after losing on the insurance payment in the accident. MDX is a close contender but smaller inside. The current Highlander seems far more refined, quiet, even more luxurious than earlier models. It is on a par with my QX60. Highlanders reputation for reliability and value were persuasive as well. Styling is much better than earlier models. V-6 without turbo (and therefore probably longer lasting), while still having ample power and using regular is a plus.",pos

So far the car handles great and I am looking forward to driving it in the snow!

"The things that am disappointed in with the ""Toyota Highlander are:     (1) Getting in and out of the car is very difficult as I am constantly hitting my head when entering the car.   (2) Wind noise is very high especially on the passenger side and my dealer says nothing can be done to help.  (3) The seat belt alarm is VERY irritating and loud.  (a warning is fine but constant loud noise makes me dislike this car).   (4) The car is very hard to program and much too hard for me to even begin to explore the options available.    (5) I cannot find any way to have more than one cell phone connected at a time, so I am unable to have both my phone and my wife's phone connected (one or the other at a time).   (6) The feature that shuts down the engine while at a stop light is very agitating and should be a option to either always on or always off.  Lastly I would like to comment on the dealership.  I was very disappointed in the dealer in my city as I felt like I was being forced into buying things I did not want to buy and almost (should have) walked out during the finance meeting.   Over all, because of the road and wind noise, along with the difficulty getting in and out of the car, I would not recommend this car.",neg
"My husband and I bought a 2015 Honda C RV Touring. We wanted the top trim, we thought we will get everything better! WRONG!!! The car besides the vibrations in idle, now is having an steering vibration after 70 miles per hour. Took it to service twice now, and the car keeps vibrating after 70 miles per hour. It had a weird knock noise in the rear axle and they discovered the drive shaft wasn't good anymore!!! My car is not even 5000 miles yet! The had to balance and do the alignment twice. CAR STILLS SHAKING after 70 miles/ hour. Now I'm waiting for the drive shaft part to come, so they can ""figure it out"" again why the car is having this steering vibrations. I think I have a lemon and I will see if I can apply the law, otherwise I might trade it in for a KIA SORENTO. I know we will lose money, but I guess my patience and time are priceless!

"I bought mine pre-owned and it had 16,000 miles on it. When I went to drive it with no AC on due to cooler temperatures, it started to shake like it needed a tune up while in drive at a red light. The idle is very rough once it gets to 500-600rpms while at a red light. After doing research, I found thousands of complaints for the same issue from other Honda owners. There is a couple class action lawsuits. I WISH I WOULD HAVE SEEN BEFORE BUYING MINE. I would have bought a different car. Also, when I am going down a hill the transmission revs and gets stuck at 3000-4000RPM and then bucks as I get to even terrain. It’s scary and I don’t feel safe. Also, I have been to a couple Honda dealers and the TSB was performed but the car shakes worse! I even took videos to take to a lawyer. Honda claims my shaking car is “operating as designed”. UNACCEPTABLE and please don’t make the same mistake as me by buying a Honda!",neg
"When hot, the CVT transmission slips all the time. Whenever you press firmly down on the accelerator the engine RPM's increase but the vehicle speed doesn't. When trying to pass a car on a 2 lane road this vehicle becomes extremely dangerous and even life threatening due to the slipping transmission. The dealer say's it's normal, but it is not normal at all. Also, the highway miles per gallon barely reaches 19 MPG due to the slipping transmision.",neg
"I bought the 2016 Elite in December and right off we had transmission problems.  Lots of jerking at low speeds.  The dealer flushed the transmission and that went away...for right now.  My idle stop stopped working also and dealer said it was fixed..2 days later it stopped working.  A week after the idle stop was ""fixed"" my check engine light comes on.  Dealer said it was probably just a loose gas cap.  They obviously don't know a thing about their vehicles.  The pilot doesn't come with a gas cap.  So, now the dealer has it for idle stop not working, engine light, remote start-sometimes it will start, sometimes it wont.  If it does remote start then the seat warmers don't work.  You have to shut the engine off and restart then they will work.  I've owned 4 other Pilots and I've never had a problem.  I will be contacting Honda Corporation today.  Hopefully this will be resolved.  

Well it's been almost a year and we still have transmission problems.  We were told by the Honda Service Dept that there is no fix for the really bad jerking when going up steep hills at a low speed.  When I first made this review I had not driven up in the mountains or any steep hills.  All the other non transmission problems seem to be resolved when they replaced the motherboard.  I do get different errors that pop up once in awhile and then they go away.  I try to take pictures of them when I can.",neg

"I recently bought a Honda CR-V EX-L W/Navigation. I did test drive a CR-V and it was ok but, I changed my mind for another color and bought a same car with different color assuming both performs the same. Honda CR-V has a serious problem of VIBRATION. When the car drives at some particular speed (like 20-30 and 50-60 mph) or if the vehicle is stopped at a signal or a stop sign, the car vibrates like anything. HONDA KNOW THIS ISSUE but selling cars without fixing the issue. When I noticed the problem just after a couple of days and took my car to the dealer, they said "" THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE. HONDA KNOW THIS PROBLEM. WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING AS THIS HAS NO FIX YET. WE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE TO FIX THIS ISSUE. WE WILL LET YOU KNOW ONCE WE HAVE ANY FIX. THIS HAPPENED TO ACCORD 2 YEARS BACK AND FIXED AFTER A WHILE. EXCEPT THIS ISSUE, YOU GOT A NICE CAR"". I don't know what they mean by NICE car if it has a serious problem in the core, and the NICE car they said costs a huge amount. So, please make as many test drives as possible. Don't get disappointed after buying the car.

"Worst mistake I ever made was buying a brand new 2016 Honda Pilot! My 2016 Pilot was purchased new in March 2016. I Drive about 30k a year so I wanted comfort and a brand that wouldn't leave me stranded as I ran up the miles. Little did I know that the issues would start at 5-7000k miles and by 18,000 mile I would just trade it in for a lose to get out of it and rental cars. 
May of 2016 my records show...No backup lights! Corrected lights and oil changed. Then the major issues started. First problem was the transmission searching for gears, ""that's normal, just v-tec"". Second was the AC only blows out of vents at a humid 67 degrees, 55 when they ""fixed"" it but in the South, that makes the air temp of the car a sticky 87+ depending on the weather, but ""that is normal"" and leaves you with a sweating butt, back, underarms and forehead. Fuel economy, that's a joke! 13.1 average but ""that is my driving style"". Fourth, popping in the front end, ""cannot duplicate"" although it's on safercar.gov as a reported issue.  Fifth, put the car in drive and it won't go! Well ""that's downhill assist and normal"". Sixth, car won't start but that ""can't be duplicated and it might have been because the driver didn't press the brake"".  Seven, no HEAT! So NO AC during the summer and now NO heat during the winter, that is ""just the new normal with these new EPA regulations"". Eight, the radio may or may not pickup local channels but ""that's normal"". Nine, the radio and camera dim to where you can't see it, but ""can't be duplicated"". Ten is when you press the gas to go while rolling and the transmission doesn't catch a gear, that my friends is why I traded this car today. Think turning left and car not going with traffic coming at you. Now I know why people sit at Left on Green when clear traffic lights! So I traded it in for a 4Runner. Info added per Edmunds email for update 6/6/2017: I lost the safety aspect of the survival cage that the Pilot has, my gas mileage is about 5 mpg better in the 4Runner, I lost the roomy comfortable interior and the awesome room of the cargo area and the storage tray in the rear. Other than those items, I have icy AC in a dark Toyota still in the same city and state that Honda said was ""normal"", I had heat this winter, and best of all....seven months in and I haven't had O.N.E. problem or issue with the 4Runner. Amazing huh? Especially since Honda said it was just me....Run and don't buy a Pilot or at least get a 2008-2015. I have friends who are still rocking theirs at 300k.

"I bought my daughter a Jeep Cherokee Limited 2015 in Feb. loaded with every extra including Blind Spot, Lane Assit. 6 cyl.  u name it. Beginning of Sept. at 5000 miles the Transmission Failed while she was driving up steep hill where she lives- The Berkeley Hills, Berkeley Ca.   It suddenly lost power, red lights began to flash on dash. Luckily after braking and turning it off and restarting with no change , she put on Emergency Brake and jumped out.
She then had more problems with the dealership, taking it in. Eventually, I- her mother- had to get involved  (I do not live in the area) and make a number of calls to Sales people at the Daly City dealership where I bought the car. None of this went well. She was able to have the car towed a week later to the Berkeley, dealership where they diagnosed the problem: Transmission Failure and replaced the transmission and updated the software. They handled the situation well but now the car Lurches forward, out of the blue.  Both these problems have been noted in complaints to NHTSA, Automotive News and other Internet forums.

"I've had the '17 Forester XT Touring for around 5 months and averaged 1k miles for each of those months--mostly commuting to/from work, but I've also taken the Forester on a road trip through the Appalachian mountains. The twin turbo in the XT adds a lot of pep and the suspension and AWD handle corners with confidence. As far as complaints go, the thicker glass and increased insulation around the doors helps cut down on road/wind noise that many complained about in prior year models, but it's still fairly noticeable on the highway. Not a major issue for me, especially not with the radio on. All-in-all the car has been comfortable, reliable, and fun to drive.

It’s taken me through winter snowstorms in PA and VA and through plenty of stop-and-go traffic in the city.

Now that Subaru dropped the XT from their lineup, I’ll be holding onto this one for a long time.",pos
"We leased our 2015 CRV for the fact we liked the new body style and the fuel economy was great. We leased for wife to drive and this gave me the peice of mind that the services would all be done at the dealership and she was in good hands. All was well with the suv, we drove it from ohio to florida and back for vacation and it had great fuel economy. However on our next trip to Tennessee we had major transmission problems over 100 miles away from home. On the way I was driving and noticed that the rpms would increase and decrease rapidly. I thought maybe some bad gas was causing the issue and stopped to assess the problem. At idle the car was fine and as I increased the throttle there were no issues. Back on the road about 15 miles and the car seemed to get worse rpms surging. We decided to turn back and limp it home to the dealership we bought it from. About 20 miles heading back the shifts got worse and the D light on the dash starts to flash. I immediately pulled over and safely got to a gas station. By the time I pulled into the gas station the rpms were at 4000 just to get the car to move a little and you could here squelling from the transmission. 3hrs later (I forgot to mention my wife was 4 months pregnant and very emotional as the trip was for valentine's weekend) we got the car to the nearest dealership to assess the transmission. The CRV only has close to 15,000 miles on it and the codes thrown for the transmission were showing total failure. We tried to get a rental from the dealership, but we didnt have honda care just 24hr roadside assistance so they said no coverage. After many calls to our dealership and the 24 hr roadside assistance  (got hung up on a couple times by them) we decided to give up on them. The dealership we were at helped us get a good rate on a rental that WE paid for and decided not to have the car ruin our valentine's weekend and I am actually writing this review in Tennessee.

My car is only two years old and I have had more fixes and issues than I did with my previous used vehicle but yet I purchased this one brand new. I gave this a very horrible review due to the fact that I do not feel safe while in my vehicle since I don't feel safe about even having my own family in my vehicle than why should anything else matter regarding the car. I had just returned home from a 2 hour drive when my transmission decided to go out for the second time. Thank goodness that I was on a surface street at the time and not still on the freeway.

That's the negative news. TYPICALLY, however, as in my new 1990 Pontiac Sunbird, once the drive train was replaced under warranty, it became the best vehicle I'd ever owned. So it's very likely that this vehicle will have a better drive train than the factory issue. However, since I'm so under the warranty, should I have further issues, I'd re-post.",neg

Again, when I first start the car if I don't wait minutes for it to warm up and just get going it lurches into gear like the transmission is going to jerk out of gear.  It is a terrible feeling and scares me at times.  It jerks so hard sometimes.  Overall, I am no longer as satisfied with this car and am not sure that I would purchase a jeep again.

"I am continually frustrated with my new Honda Pilot, and want to share a brief glimpse into my experience in case it can help someone else…

Electronics:
-imagine computers in the '90s …
-imagine IT department back then ... turn it on/off, and if that doesn't fix it, ""that's the way its supposed to work""
-I have gone to dealer numerous times with a typed list 2-3 pages long of all the issues.  Yes, most are just annoying things, like feeling a $5 radio from Walmart wouldn't have the same intermittent reception issues, or that the navigation on my phone (pick any app!) is 10x better, or the audio for the bluray play just stops working for a couple days every now and then, or that I sometimes have to turn the Pilot off/on to adjust the temperature controls, or that sometimes things just randomly stop working for a while (and then magically work again … and then not …), etc.
-the dealer people are nice and mean well, and yes they have had some updates that seemed to fix much of the issues, but not all, and other issues come back after awhile
-SERIOUS: situations where Pilot could have caused an accident
  1) while turning onto a busy street, my vehicle 100% on its own, went into neutral and the engine revved all the way up, then a second later it was back in Drive, and fortunately the accelerator was not still all the way down on its own 
  2) car slammed on the brakes, 100% on its own (and I mean slammed, screeching tires, everything in the car going flying), stopping me ~30’ from where a car in front of me had been slowly turning off the road into a parking lot.  The thought of self braking is great, but even if the turning car had stopped, worst case a small corner would have been sticking in the road and I would have slowed down/around, or even had plenty of time/room to stop.  

Other examples: 
-cup holders in front are made for Big Gulps, so every other drink container bounces around, so my whole middle console is covered with coffee/other stains
-front storage is just one monster tub (old Pilots had compartments that let you organize space)
-rear seats do not lean back 1/3 as much as in previous Pilots (so kids can't sleep as easily)
-had to replace all 4 tires after just ~19,000 miles
-stainless steel running boards have rusting screws/or other fastener behind them that are constantly leaking rust out; and because “elbow grease” can remove the leaking rust from the stainless steel, its not a warranty issue (we just need to apply “elbow grease” after it rains every time)
-maintenance plan is basically bring it in, and we’ll let you know what’s needed
-engine always sounds like its short a few quarts of oil
-at random times (independent of outside humidity or dryness) all of the windows will fog up, and I need to blast the defroster
-and a laundry list of other annoyances

Are there a lot of good to great things about the new Pilot – Yes, absolutely.  But I have never had a vehicle that had so many issues and annoyances.  I previously owned an older Honda Pilot and LOVED it!  Had I known what the new Pilot is like, I would have rather kept my old model and put $40K into it!!  I have looked into the lemon laws, but all of the problem above are generally intermittent, and can be rationalized away as subjective opinion (“that’s the way its supposed to work”)

"Although this car spends over 90% of the time on well-maintained roads, I got it for its ability to handle dirt roads, so-so trails, and times I need decent ground clearance (like our annual trips to the snow). What brought me to the Subaru Forester from the Nissan XTerra and other vehicles with better off-road competence were its 1) lower price, 2) better fuel economy, 3) better seating comfort, and 4) better handing on regular streets and highways. Outward visibility is excellent. I can drive through traffic without having to lean from side to side to check my blind spots. On highway trips I get around 34 mpg with a full load, and on my daily drive of 80% highway and 20% regular streets by myself I get about 30 mpg. I used at have a 2009 Subaru Outback but did not keep it because my then 11-year old daughter found the rear seat legroom insufficient, but on our recent road trip she and her now 10-year old sister had plenty of leg room in the Forester. Both are about 5'4"" tall, and I'm 6'2"". Cargo room is decent for the vehicle size. The biggest compromise I had to make to enjoy all these benefits is the slow acceleration. When passing slower vehicles on our recent road trip, the vehicle was less than inspiring (especially when going uphill). The engine revved loudly but the CVT didn't give me much confidence I was going to get enough oomph to pass quickly enough to avoid oncoming traffic. Needless to say, we survived.

"Well to base my past experience, I have owned a 1992 pontiac grand prix from 2000-2002, a 1999 caviler from 2002-2006, a 2004 mitsibishi outlander from 2006-2007, and a 2007 Nissan Sentra from 2007 to currently. And this Forester, which I bought new in Feb. 2016.. I always felt unsatisfied by my vehicles, and I always had buyers remorse. The Nissan was a good car, great gas mileage, affordable but this Forester gets as good or better gas mileage but has 250 HP to really ZOOM through traffic! I just drove 4 hours each way to Minneapolis from Fargo, ND going 78-95 and got 32 mpg average, but the car is rated 23-28. How cool is that? That happens all the time. I consistently get over thirty MPG in this car. The visibility on the 2016 forester is just amazing, the windows are so big and getting into anything like a kia sportage or a ford edge makes me feel claustrophobic now. The car is very easy and smooth to handle. If you want a mid-line SUV, i agree some interiors look a little better, some exteriors look better (the 2016 Mazda looks way better than the forester and I would even say steering is better) but if you get a Turbo Forester it is just kicking! Some things I do not like about the car are that the seats are uncomfortable on drives past 3 hours, the rear seats are not perfectly flush with 'trunk' space when folded down, so you lose some loading ability with that and it seems like something they should have been able to solve easily, the brakes are OK but my sentra's were much better, the steering is almost too smooth and sensitive, there is no play and no feedback so that can be dangerous at high speeds or fast turning, the interior materials are OK - seats and dash are good, paneling on doors is total crap. Speakers were so [non-permissible content removed] it was unbelievable - I swapped speakers and the ones they hid behind the door furnishings were cardboard pieces of junk! No wonder they hid them, and they are super small. Plus radio that comes with has only 30 watt output... pathetic. Last, the rear light is the size of a zippo lighter. Why? Hondas have ten lights on each side going all the way up. I often come home after dark and you can't see anything back there - the light is only 8"" from the floor too so its easily obstructed. Thank goodness for the lights on phones now. Oh well. Every time I get in this thing I feel like i floating along the road bc the visibility and smooth ride is so nice, and unless a camero or porche pulls up you can probably zoom right past whoever is next to you! And get 32 mpg doing it! WOW!",pos
An obvious defect in the leather dash caused it to bubble up and separate. dealer would not help. I am left with an expensive mess. very disapointed,neg
We just brought this car last month 7/1/2015 and already I'm started to hear a weird squeak noise after i start the engine.  At first I thought it was because I left the car for couple of days without using it but is not the case.  It's happening quite frequently now.   I go in press the brake then the start button and the engine comes on and then a squeak noise.  Please let me know if anyone else is having this issue.  I will take this in and see what is going on.  Thanks,neg
"Great view of the road, comfortable, lots of room and one of the safest vehicles on the road today. This is the third Subaru Forrester that I have owned and each one gets better and better as far as safety and comfort is concerned. Lots of room with the back seats down to transport things.  Great in snow for the people that live in the Northeast",pos
Drove all of the competition and nothing performs as well as the Forester XT. We bought a Touring XT with the 2.0 Turbocharged engine. Great acceleration and handling. 30 mpg on the highway. Luxurious interior. Great handling. Priced right.,pos
"I needed to replace my 2007 4Runner Trail with a new vehicle that would get me, passengers, the dog, and goods, through the snow, the mud, and the dust to my camp in central Maine.  I also needed a safe car that I could maneuver on the highways up and down the East Coast, get decent mileage, and have a solid array of safety features.  Unfortunately the new 4Runner does not have adaptive cruise control, blind spot/cross lane warnings, crash avoidance systems, etc. I refused to pay an extra $10,000 for the Lexus.  So I ended up with the AWD Highlander Platinum Limited and its extensive array of safety features.  Obviously, there is a big difference between driving a truck-based and a car based SUV, such as the Highlander.  In this respect, I don't miss the 4Runner Trail.  We'll see when I'm stuck in high snow whether I miss the 4WD.  But for now, I'm thrilled driving the Highlander.  While the interior looks massive, it isn't a big car.  While I thought about the Ford Explorer for a couple of days, as I liked the parking assist and the safety features involving the front of the car, I opted for the Toyota because of quality assurance and the cheaper price.  

I have driven it for two months, including nine-hour trips up and down the East Coast.  I have stopped worrying about changing lanes because of the safety features.  I was able to carry more goods than the 4Runner.  And on the last trip North during a cold winter's day, I averaged over 25 mpg...with only 1500 miles on the odometer.  Who knows what I'll get during the summer after it has been broken in.  My personal list of likes besides all the safety items: a comfortable seat, a decent sounding audio system, a nice interior design, especially the shelf in the front to carry wallets, phones, etc., the flip-up back window, the car handling, the automatic headlights/bright beams, and the automatic windshield wipers.  I only wish they had included front parking radar.  I am one of the last to have a Windows phone, which doesn't quite mesh with the Entune system...but it works.  While I miss the rugged 4Runner capability, but I now have AWD and all types of safety mechanisms that will keep me safe.  So far, it exceeds expectations.",pos
"My last car prior to this one was the 2002 Toyota Highlander Limited; I loved that car, but sadly and unexpectedly the transmission died and I wasn't going to pay $500 to fix it, for obvious reasons. I decided to use that money for purchasing a new car. I looked at other cars and strongly considered purchasing the Honda Pilot since I owned a Highlander before. My husband, thank God, convinced me to test drive the 2014 Highlander. The minute I started driving it I knew it was my car. I did buy the Limited model since I had that previously. It drives like a dream and is very sleek. Speaking from owning the first generation, it is vastly different. I love the second row captain chairs! I have two young boys and having their own chairs not only makes them special, but has cut down on the fighting between them. Speaking of which, although feature Drive Speak Easy amplifies your voice so the passengers in the back can hear you, it is a bit of a hassle to turn it on since you have to use the screen to get to it, not very convenient for driving, but I am also not used to having it. So by second nature, I still yell at my sons to be quiet. As for the screen, great to access apps, but using it for the camera, during daylight the glare makes it hard to view it, I have to rely on the back up sensors and look behind the old fashioned way. As far as the handsfree option, when you use the command to try and make a phone call it's response time is slow, I just use Siri on my iPhone to make calls. The navigation, the jury is still out. When we first used the Navigation it was on our way to Oregon. One of the features notifies of heavy traffic or hazards; it supposedly reconfigures the traffic route; however on this particular trip it reconfigured us right into the heavy commute time traffic in Portland, Oregon. I now rely on the WAZE app for my navigation, which is a great app, by the way. I have yet had the need to use features of the Snow and four-wheel drive switches. My old Highlander you would just need to turn on the Snow switch, but this one you need to turn the four-wheel on as well. My old one worked great driving in the snow so I doubt this would be an issue in the newer models. It is a great vehicle when driving to ski areas or when you are on roads that there could be snow. If you get caught in snow you'd be fine. If you like to off road, maybe this is not the vehicle to have, unless you are driving in campgrounds. There are switches for down hill assist and VSC so you have the option of turning off the VSC. As a owner of a first generation model, which it was always on, not sure why their is a VSC switch in the new models. Since my last car did not have the Blind Spot monitor or back sensors and such it took me a bit to get used to them. The Platinum feature which I did not opt for because of price had the Lane Deparature and Brake Assist (or whatever it is called, but you can set your car at a certain distance when on cruise control and when you get passed that it slows the car down). Anyway, to me, if you need to rely on those features, you probably shouldn't be on the road. I like the driver seat memory since my husband is 6'3 it is great to have our own seat settings. In the past it would take me about 5 minutes to adjust the my seat mirrors, not anymore. Overall, I am pleased with this car and would recommend it to anyone that is looking into buying a comfort SUV. I forgot to mention that I also considered the Acura MDX, but for the price this is just as comparable. However, if you are set on name and luxury brands then this is not the car for you, but if you want the luxury and an affordable price you should consider the Highlander.",pos

"My 2017 Forester XT Touring model has been one disappointment after another. The CVT transmission is just horrible, and completely detracts from owning the turbo model. When I try to accelerate quickly there is a 2 second delay before the car takes off. The manual shift mode doesn't help at all. The RPMs jump up to about 4000 and just stay there (whether I'm in the manual shift mode or not) until I ease up on the accelerator. The Harman Kardon sound system is terrible, too. The bass response is overbearing. I have to turn the bass all the way down, and it's still way too overbearing. The Harman Kardon system doesn't have speed controlled volume leveling, or several other features that are found on Subaru's basic sound system. The paint job on my Forester is terrible. The paint is so thin that it is chipped very easily. While washing the car, I have found several tiny little chips in the hood, the roof, and the doors. It seems that every time I wash the car I find new chips in the paint. I took it to the dealer to report the problem with the paint and the dealer told me to report the problem to Subaru of America (SOA). I reported the problem to SOA and they told me to take the vehicle to a dealer. The dealer says there's nothing they can do about the paint, so SOA says there's nothing they can do either. The climate control system doesn't work very well. When I'm heating up the interior, in the winter, and the desired temperature is reached, the AC comes on. The remote start is pretty worthless because the car shuts off when I open the door, so I have to re-start the vehicle (brilliant engineering). I have music stored on a USB drive, but every time I switch to the USB to listen to music it takes several minutes for the music to load. There are many other disappointments with this vehicle. Let me just say that I had a 2005 Forester XT Limited that blew this this away, as far as the overall quality was concerned, but also performance wise, too. Subaru has gone way downhill. I'll never own another one after this.",neg
"I have had this car for less than 2 months and I want to get rid of it already.  I paid Toyota to install a DVD player and it doesn't work. We have taken it back twice and they still can't figure out why the sound keeps cutting in and out. I was driving around the other day and the entire ceiling light with Sunglasses holder fell down and smacked me in the face! I've had my brand new 2017 for less than 2 months and it's been in the shop 3 times!!!!  I called Toyota 3 times about the light and they promised to call me back in 5 minutes, it's been 1 week and still no call back. They only care about selling the car, their service department is the worst and they don't call you back (happens every time you call, you just have to keep calling).  I have always heard amazing things about Toyota but after spending over 40,000 on a brand new car and they don't even care enough to call back when things fall out of the ceiling and smack someone in the face why would I ever buy another one let alone keep the one I have? The only time they will actually reach back out to you is when they get a bad review, I am devastated by the treatment we have received thus far. I'm going back to Subaru.",neg
"This is our third Subaru, the first was an Outback it's equity helped us get out of a Mini Cooper S lease. No problems with the wagon at all, wasn't happy about the looks but great for beach and carrying around a new born. Then we thought she since she is getting older we could get by with the sportier looking Subaru Crosstrek. Great car for beach and dependable averaged 32-33 MPG in the city, a bit slower than the Outback. But we soon realized that it was to small for the three of us, no problems with any of the vehicles( oil burning, unusual trips to dealer). We took the Crosstrek in for routine maintenance and test drove a Forester 2.5i premium excellent vehicle getting 30 MPG in the city , real quite inside, seating position is quite a bit taller and a lot more cargo space :-] . Loaded it up this past weekend and went to the beach, the all wheel drive system is better than Crosstrek, we never got stuck in it but there is an obvious difference. The text to speech function, 8"" display, power drivers seat, reclining rear seat , rear center arm rest with cup holders and the panoramic sun roof are great. I replaced the interior light bulbs with leds they make the interior look better at night. A definite keeper..",pos
"I love most things about the CRV. I know, Ive only driven 500 miles and its been 2 weeks, but I think its gonna be a winner! Its peppy and has all the features to love like awd, good ground clearance, good gas mileage, good cargo, versatility, etc. It has cool new tech Im Lovin, like keyless entry, keyless start, push to start so no more key action. The regular radio interface is terrible but who cares cause they incorporated Apple Carplay (and Android carplay too which Im assuming is equally as good) so its just an awesome interface! Adaptive cruise control is really neat too. So much to love in this car, I highly recommend!!! The small gripes I have so far is theres no great place to put your change and the visibility is ok but not top notch. And thats even mitigated with blind spot recognition.",pos

"Purchased a 2016 Pilot Touring AWD new.  Very expensive!  But worth it.  We have a number of kids and have thoroughly enjoyed this SUV.  It sits up pretty high, much higher than a minivan (which we have also owned) but drives fairly smoothly and easily.  It has a lot of power but isn't except nimble.  The comfort and minimal road noise are its best qualities.  I have read a number of reviews that complain about the nine speed transmission, but we have found it to work just fine and shift smoothly. The seats are supportive and the interior materials are high quality.  The only drawback is that the space behind the rear sets is small, at least compared to a minivan.  The headlights look great (especially the daytime running LEDs) and the body style is attractive but not overbearing.  I average 25 mph in about 40% city driving and 60% highway driving, which is excellent for this large of a vehicle.  It handles in snow like a dream!  We live on a hill and have had several days where we probably would not have made it home without the pilot AWD.  The rim package on the Touring looks sweet.  Love this car!",pos

"This is not our first Honda CRV but it may be the last. We purchased a new 2015 Honda CRV and the dealer did not have the integrity to say that there was an issue regarding the vibration or shuddering at lower rpm's. Honda has a video concerning the problem which had I known about would have at least alerted me to the problem. The dealers know about the video but most consumers do not know about this video. Can not believe a manufacturer for which many have high regard would dump such vehicles on the buying public. Honda let us down after getting our cash.  My word to the wise: DO NOT BUY A NEW HONDA CRV. You have been warned. I understand there is a pending class action suit against Honda and hopefully if there is any justice, we who have been screwed by Honda will receive some sort of meaningful resolution.

The above review was written awhile ago and since then, we have rid ourselves of the Honda CRV for which the manufacturer should know we replaced with a 2017 Subaru Outback that is far superior to any Honda I have owned previously.

"I have the car for one year and the Collision Mitigation Braking System (CMBS) never did work in Stage 2 or Stage 3.
Only the warning light comes on. Brakes are never applied. Going more than 10 MPH faster than the car ahead of you, only Stage 1 comes on with a warning notice. No light braking for Stage 2. No hard braking for Stage 3. I am Emergency Vehicle Operator Course trained. I had someone who I know keep a constant speed of 30 MPH and then retested again going 50 MPH. I would approach going 10 MPH faster than the lead car and only Stage 1 warning would activate, even when I was only 10 feet away before I had to manually apply the brakes hard. Apparently Honda/Accura had an earlier issue with the CMBS falsely activating due to being too sensitive. They did a software update but now it is not activating stage 2 or stage 3. This occurs no matter what setting ( long, normal, short) you have the CMBS set to. I brought it in twice to the dealer and although the service tech test drove it and couldn't get the brakes to work the computer stated everything was fine. Honda tech line was also called by the dealer and they said if the computer said there was no errors there is nothing to do. I called Honda Corporation and they also said there was nothing that could be done. Automatic Cruise Control works so it can't be the Radar or camera. This is a 2016 Honda Pilot Elite with CMBS.

"Our top of the line Touring CR-V 2WD has only one power seat , only one side camera when turning right. Car has NO lane change avoidance warnings/tones or backing up side avoidance warning/tones When you engage the cruise control the Collision Mitigation Braking System or the Forward Collision Warning will slow you when it senses a car in front of you and when that car drives away the car will down shift to catch up so hold on car goes into hyper acceleration and this is dangerous !  . Now remember this car has a Eco button that softens the gas pedal rate which will save gas but does not inter function with the cruise engaged. The car has electric controlled mirrors but the car won't remember your settings but has a 2 person driver only seat memory  . When in reverse the camera works but will NOT warn you or apply brakes if there is an obstruction in the warning area and the camera is poor visual quality . The screen and it's electronics are not user friendly , When entering the car and starting the radio will come on but you have to use the steering wheel controls to lower the audio sound. Looking for fuel average or instant gas mileage,  it won't be on the fuel screen in the center of the dash you have to select it in the center cluster . I don't even think the mirrors will fold in with a push of a button. The main screen , I have been trying to get the clock to default to if your done with say audio or your done with the navigation . The lane Departure Warning seems the best part of the car it will correct the steering to maintain its position in the lane and warn you if your getting close or it can't sense the lanes position , This is great as an autonomous feature but it will search from side to side of the lane  , I just wish I could adjust the warning signal to integrate into the audio and in a louder tone .

I bought a 2015 jeep sport 4 cylinder and have transmission issues already havent even got the tags for it or made one payment on it . When you use reverse and put it in driver it has a hesitation then jumps into gear. Also when put in park from drive or reverse in sounds like the front end is going to fall out. Took it to the dealership and was told it has a memory transmission and it takes time to get used to you i said ok but the front end sounding like it was about to fall out i dont belive that is memory. They have had it for for days and finally tell me they have to wait for Chrysler to approve a part this was after doing updates on a brand new car what the heck.So i call the next day and they tell me that it needs a new transmission and they dont know how long it will take but they have ordered it. After all the reviews i have read i am scared to death of this jeep and for my family i wish i would have done my homework first and to pour salt in my wound i got my tags today for it for heaven sake and its at the shop .Feeling very scared and very mad i guess it will take a lot of deaths before jeep does something about this issue and thats sad i hope i am not a statistic,neg

Also the front drives seat is very uncomfortable as your left arm rests to low on the door hand rest. If they don't come up with a fix soon I will trade in for a Honda Pilot. I will never buy a Toyota again after this experience. Its been in the shop at least 8 times with no resolve. Just traded in for Honda Pilot because dealer and Toyota could not fix problem and said they do not have a fix. I will never buy a toyota again.",neg
"We had the same issues with the 9 Speed transmission.  Honda advised there was a software upgrade to address the problem so we made an appointment.  The day before the appointment, the car overheated.  Problem was the transmission cooler leaked coolant into the transmission.  Honda is now installing a new transmission and flushing the cooling system.  According to the mechanic, there have been other instances where coolant was slowly leaking into the transmission.  So we'll see what happens.  Honda installed a new transmission under warranty.  However, when I asked if the new transmission was improved to eliminate the defects leading to the transmission failure, the Honda service department could not guarantee that the new transmission would not have the same failure in the future.  Since the manufacturer warranty on the Pilot is only 60K miles, we purchased an extended warrantee (100K Miles).  The new transmission does not shift smoothly and we'll need to have this diagnosed by Honda during our next service.",neg
"Not normally a ""review"" gal but I had to defend the Forester. My prior car was a Hyundai,  relatively new,  that felt like a bucket of bolts compared to the Forester. If you are looking for glitz go somewhere else.  If you want a smooth ride with fantastic driver field of vision and feeling SAFE in your car, you should take the time to drive it. I have had mine for 5 months and love it. I have been consistently beating the predicted gas mileage. My very tall husband fits with room to spare.  Actually,  he leaves his E350 home for my Forester every chance he gets.  If that isn't an endorsement not sure what is.",pos

"Great vehicle, but you may want to check out the front seat first.  I have had trouble for quite some time tying to get the front seat to adjust to me properly so much so that my left leg and often my left arm does not go numb within a 1/2 hour of my drive.  Believe I have tried every combination with the seat and steering wheel.  It may be because the seat needs some time to soften up or it may be due to my height. The seat hits me under my knees, due to the length of the seat pan.  About two weeks into owing the car it has not cause as much of an issue.  The seat may be softening or I have figured out how to adjust it just so.  Just pray you do not have to move it like I did and then try to find that spot that worked again.  I just ordered two different type of seat cushions to see if that will help. The first one not so much yet.  Otherwise I love the car! It has a great HD radio.  I love that I can see all around me while driving in traffic.  I love the big windows, especially in the back!  I have not had time to play with all the other new gadgets yet, so I can not speak to them.",pos
"We test drove many SUVs before deciding what to purchase. We ended up buying the 2017 Touring Edition. So quiet on startup, cant hear the engine turnover. A nice, quiet drive on the road with perfect suspension. Quiet in cabin, no rattling, road noise is minimal. Responsive steering and light vehicle (compared to our Tacoma. Our first trip was 700 miles with our three dogs. The rear seats folded down flat and the dogs had their very own dog lair. Plenty of room for our luggage and dogs.

Dealership ended up replacing the transmission and computer (mind you at this point I haven't had the vehicle 6 months). Less than 30 days after transmission was replaced I am in a rental car same issues with the car! Very annoyed, inconvenienced and overly disappointed.",neg

Haven't driven it on dirt forest/logging roads yet, but I am confident it will do well over the rougher sections  with the sophisticated x-mode AWD system and good ground clearance.

"The jeep cherokee limited is a great looking Suv , However the 9 speed Transmission Sucks !!! The salespeople will tell you its a smooth ride which is true however if you like to be jerked forward at times going 56 miles an hour i felt like i was going to get whiplash . Immediately called the dealership since my vechicle is only 8 months old and complained about the jerking once again which makes this number 2 for taking it back to the dealership . I was told by my service advisor ""It's like your cell phone we have to update the software  "". Seriously I have only updated my cell phone once in the last 2 years . I have been reading alot of consumers complaints regarding the transmmission and how the  dealerships keep telling consumers that everything is fine , if that was the case then explain to me why there are 190 complaints regarding the transmission on carcomplaints.com/ jeep , and also on Edmunds.com same thing consumers are reporting  Transmission problems .

"The short block was replaced at approx 18K miles because it failed the oil consumption test (bad rings- Subaru extended warranty to 100K for oil consumption issues). There was a grinding noise on cold start-up attributed to excessive rod clearance. Due to this issue, the short block was replaced again at approx 20K miles. The grinding noise continued. The short block was replaced again at approx 22K miles. Noise went away. At the next oil change (28K miles), the oil level was right near the top of the dipstick. At the second oil change (34K miles), oil was down 1/2 quart. I expect to fail oil consumption test shortly and need another short block. Any ideas about how to dispose of this vehicle other than lemon law?",neg
This is an early review. So far so good. Vehicle was built end of April. Purchased last weekend. Fit and finish is top notch. All panels interior and exterior are well aligned. Pain is glossy with no orange peel. White diamond pearl is a great color. Interior is flawless. Leather seats are of much higher quality than our last pilot. Interior materials are top flight and switch gear feels very solid. Doors close with a solid luxury thud. Low road noise and zero rattles - low NVH). No air leaks. Power train is refined - acceleration close to brisk. Road composure is surefooted and Lexus like in shock absorption. Only gripe is the FM reception (but bought knowing that clarion is issuing a fix in June.) This has a lot of MDX DNA and quality built in.,pos
"The 2017 Touring is our 2nd Pilot and has been a big disappointment. The underpowered engine has a tough time accelerating into traffic and the new 9-speed transmission hard-shifts instead of a smooth and seamless shift, jerking passengers in the car.

When you buy a brand new car you should have at least 5 years of NO mechanical issues but I have had nothing but these costly issues since owning it. My warranty no longer covers the bumper to bumper and I have even reached out to the manufacturer after learning that I was not the only person experiencing these issues with this type & model but yet there is no recall (I guess because no one has died yet-sad I know but we all know how this works) and they wouldn't do a dang thing about it, not a single thing!

Just bot a 2018 Forester with cvt transmission. I no more than got it home and the car would cut out 1-2 seconds or more from a stop or slow movement. Apparently this can be a problem with some cvt transmissions. It is dangerous in close traffic or pulling out into oncoming traffic. Took it back to the dealer who told me it takes a while for the car to get used to my driving habits. I cant buy this. Once the car cuts out it starts back up with a sudden jerk forward. This is unacceptable and am considering envoking the lemon law. Also the spedometer is set back under a cover and is hard to read.,neg
"I purchased the Cherokee sport 1 year ago, I Traded in my 5 year old Grand Cherokee since it was out of warranty BIG MISTAKE!!!  This car was a nightmare, the windshield wipers shut off on the highway in a torrential downpour more than once, the drivers side window would get stuck in the down position and it had to go to the dealer to be fixed more than once. The back up camera only worked half the time, on top of that when I had enough of this pc of crap and decided to trade it in with 16,000 miles the car was worth 1/2 of what i paid for it. The depreciation on this vehicle is horrible. I did not just take the dealers offer on the trade in. The Kelly blue book also shows the value is 50% after 1 year. My grand Cherokee was 5 years old and over 50K miles and I got 60% of its purchase value at trade in. DO NOT buy this vehicle unless you plan to keep it forever and pray it doesn't wind up at the dealer for problems every month.

The Eyesight system , with adaptive cruise control, object detection and automatic speed reduction works extremely well and very smoothly.

The touchscreen MMI is simply awful...I cant believe Subaru fell short on this while doing so well on everything else.

After many days and nights of stress dealing with Toyota (Corporate and Westport dealership) the problem was diagnosed as needing a new transmission.  The transmission was ""lost"" during shipping - the entire process has been awful. A new transmission had to be put into my ""new"" car.  I do not feel safe in this car which obviously was a lemon.

"I can’t speak to the long term reliability but  the 2018 Forester is in the last year of its current generation, so theoretically most of the bugs have been worked out and a lot of the little imperfections have been smoothed out. These facts made my decision easier, any knowledgeable mechanic will tell you not to buy a vehicle in the first couple years of its current generation. 

I’ve drove automatic V6 vehicles for the last 10 plus years and was apprehensive about a 4 cylinder CVT drivetrain. I was instantly shocked how smooth and powerful the combo transfed thd power. The 4 cylinder boxer/Cvt feels soo much more refined than my V6/autos up hill, highway merging, passing on highway, absolutely no compromise or concerns! I can’t say enough how happy I am with the mechanical performance. I also got to drive it around in 3 inches if snow it was as surefooted in the snow as any 4wd vehicle I’ve ever driven. With last years added sound deadening  I found the cabin to very quiet and comfortable. Also the suspension feels composed on rough roads. 

It would of been nice if the 2018’s came with Apple Car Play but it wasn’t a deal breaker, as the factory Starlink 7 in. unit is pretty slick, and has performed perfectly.

Gas mileage has been really good so far, and I would expect it to get even better after the 1000 mile break in period us done. 

I wanted a Jeep Wrangler my entire life but once I started researching Wranglers I quickly saw the Jeeps  lacks value, and safety features. To me the Forester seemed like the perfect substitute for a Wrangler. The Forester has an panoramic moonroof, way more safety features, gets way better mpg, and most likely way better reliability. Not to mention Subaru gas better financing and are considerably cheaper msrp than a comparable Wrangler. Not to turn this into a dump on a Wrangler review, nothing else totally compares to one but for my situation this is what made sense.",pos

"The Honda from hell. Bought a 2016 Honda Pilot Touring. Picked up my new SUV from Morristown Honda and took it on a road trip the next day. It  failed me three times on a road trip with computer issues to So Fla. The power steering wouldn't work along with other issues on the dash board. Needless to say, It was left at the dealership in South Fla the following morning. After 12 days left the vehicle in So Fla. It's now day 25 without my new  vehicle. Have requested another vehicle since it never worked safely the day after purchase. Honda Motors and Morristown Honda have only just given me lip service on that issue. They plan to ship it to me when repaired. Today I heard from the service department of the So Fla dealership and informed me the part has come in and if the SURGERY goes well I will get a call back.

Purchased my brand new 2015 Cherokee limited in April and have not had anything but nightmares with it. First it is very uncomfortable. Then had my panorama roof leak while going through a car wash only to have the dealership tell me that the panorama roof is not designed to withstand a high pressure car wash or a heavy downpour rain! REALLY?  So since I don't own a garage I guess I should have ordered the tarp package to go with my new Cherokee!!! Give me a break Chrysler!!! The air bag light came on and the power drivers seat stopped working. All of this with less than 3500 miles on my Cherokee. I have it back at the dealership where I bought it for a second time for the roof leak. Chrysler never states in any of its manuals nor do they or the dealership disclose that the roof will leak. As far as I am concerned thus vehicle is a lemon and I will be fighting with Chrysler to just take the terrible thing back. My advice....go buy a chevrolet or a ford or shopping cart!!! Anything but the jeep Cherokee!,neg
"Very weird shifting/braking.  At slow speeds, ""phantom braking"" causes sudden deceleration. Push start only works if I'm pushing very hard on the brake.  JUST INCREDIBLE to me that the car is not compatible with Apple CarPlay, a technology that's been around for years. Lack of integration makes everything clunky. Want your car to narrate incoming text messages for you? Don't buy a Pilot.  Honda claiming it's a hardware issue and can't retrofit, even though Accords have it. Boggling.  Dash is glitchy - sometimes auto-dims at night, other times I have to open settings and manually dim it.  Stupid detail, but that huge display screen tells me almost nothing. Listening to a song on the radio and want to know what it is? It will display 8-10 characters only, leaving half the screen blank.  This car was not designed to thrill a driver.  Vexing, yes.

"This SUV is not worth spending money on! The first week I bought this Jeep the engine light came on 3 different times. Kept getting the runaround by the dealership. Now that I have had this Jeep for a year, I have realized buying it was the worst decision I ever made when buying a car. I paid a little over $32,000 and a year later it is only valued at $15,000-17,000. I cannot even trade for anything that I want because of the difference of value and what is owed.

"Let me start by saying I am currently in arbitration with the National Center for Dispute Settlement http://ncdsusa.org/ and will move onto Lemon Law litigation. I have a 2015 Honda CRV AWD Touring currently over 13k miles and have experienced an array of problems which really has put a sour taste in my mouth because of the numerous problems with our CRV and the type of response from Honda.  I have taken the car into service departments that have either took note of, tried numerous fixes or not at all, but in the end we are told that nothing can be done because this is a ""characteristic of the vehicle"" and no fix is needed .  I've even been told by my Honda dealer doing the warranty work that I can take my business to another dealer.   I recommend you document all of your visits, even test drives with service advisors, log phone calls and make sure service records state what you reported, what work was done, what was noticed on test drives. I have met with District Parts and Service Manager, filed with Honda Customer Service, sent certified letters and all have resulted in the same response. This is a characteristic of the vehicle. Make sure to file these problems/complaints with Honda Customer Service 1-800-999-1009 and the NHTSA https://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/VehicleComplaint/ so the government takes notice. Here are some of the issues you may experience with the CRV.

 1. Vibration issues for mode 1, 2 and 3 before and after TSB 15-046
-Driving Mode 1: While stopped with vehicle in gear.
-Driving Mode 2: While between 1,000–1,200 rpm at takeoff.
-Driving Mode 3: While driving between 1,800–2,200 rpm around 40–50 mph.
 2. Vibration at highway speeds 70-80+
 3. Shudder, stall when in reverse
 4. Steering issues
-Pulls left under acceleration when wheel centered
-Does not maintain center/neutral position or track straight down the road without excessive intervention. 
-Intermittently needs unexpected intervention through turns as the steering is not direct or does not reflect input from the driver. 
-The steering requires more input in one direction versus another. Intermittently steering becomes very heavy as if no power assist is given. 
5. Car whines/whistles when driving

These are the problems my car continues to have after taking them in to get ""fixed"".

Update:

In the end Honda offerred me a few thousand to close out arbitration while not owning up to or fixing the problems.   I unloaded the car as a trade-in since people seem to keep buying them.  I watched the car sit at the car dealership for months and not sure if it sold or was sent off to auction.   I was going to go through Lemon Law litigation but did not want to put in the time while holding on to the car.    Its a real shame, I have a 2008 Acura RL and have owned many Honda through the years without any problems.   But Honda's bean counters just screwed up.   And now the new Honda Accord 4 cylinder is having issues with the Earth Dreams/CVT combo vibration.   Read the forums.   Google Earth Dreams Vibration.    Go to NHTSA.gov and you will see all the complaints.",neg
"We set a decibel meter in the the cabin and at 70 mph the 93 db reading requires hearing protection by the federal government.  You get engine noise at low speed and tire noise along with wind noise at speeds higher than 45 mph.

JBL radio speakers are poor and there is not a setting that will pair volume with increased sound so in town at 40 mph your radio volume is set at 12 for volume and on the highway at 70 mph you need to turn the radio up to a setting of 28.  This is my forth Toyota and it will be my last.",neg
"It runs fun I love it. If the fuel efficiency can be improved, that's the best!",pos
"Update:  I have now owned the car almost two years.   I would likely not buy another Pilot until they update the transmission.  First to second is slow to shift and not smooth, there are times it take 5 seconds to go from reverse to drive, and it can be very slow to downshift.   I also get a slow speed downshift squeak that is repeatable but the dealership can’t fix.  I have had some minor other issues with the stereo (random clicking and popping) and a squeaky drivers side door during driving.  The start stop feature is terribly implemented and it annoys me that I cannot permanently disable it.

This could be a great car but Honda chose gas mileage above drivability.  The transmission is a deal killer and would keep away from any car with the horrible ZF 9 speed.  I will reconsider driving one when the new 10 speed is implemented.

On a non Typical note for Honda- why in the world would they implement a navigation system that has audio notifications of traffic when the navigation system is off?  It makes the stereo randomly beep for no reason even if the traffic is many miles ahead.  Stupidest engineering choice I have seen in a vehicle in a long time.

Original:  After two weeks of ownership I have virtually no buyers remorse.  I feel I must preface this review by stating that it is based in comparison off my previous vehicle, a 2010 Audi Q5 3.2, which was a great car with virtually no issues at 92k miles.  This car is vastly different, but that is ok.  It is big.  In fact, surprising big for most people who have seen it.  There really is a ton of room, recently taken 4 tall young adults and 2 parents on a two hour trip with no complaints, even from the third row.  The ride is on the soft side, but I knew this was not going to a sporty small German SUV.  You can feel the weight through turns but there is minimal body lean and the extra weight makes this thing a exemplary freeway cruiser.  It is far quieter than the Audi and the chassis seems more solid with far less shutter with sudden bumps in the road.  The interior materials are fine for the most part.  I would have liked some wood in the touring model and the piano black gloss trim picks up fingerprints (and I foresee lots of scratches in the future) but otherwise things are soft with little ultra hard plastic.  The engine and transmission combo is interesting but I dont find it as bad as some of the magazines have found it to be.  Maybe I have a new software version but things generally run smoothly but, given the 9 speeds, it does shift a lot.  I have found no issues during deceleration, but around 40-45 and 55-60, the ratios seem like they are too close.  Unfortunately, those are common speeds and so if feels like it is searching a bit.  The shifts are not abrasive, just frequent.  The first gear is also really tall and takes some getting used to.  I have found the eco mode to be way too blunted and has earned the nickname ""grandma mode"" only to be used cruising on flat highways with cruise control on.   With eco off, things are fine but you do have to dive deep on the pedal to get any real acceleration.  I do wish the sport mode was more sporty.  It doesnt seem to alter the throttle response much and just seems to want to hold 2 gears lower than it normally would.  In the Audi, sport mode would totally change the demeanor of this vehicle.  Increase throttle response, make more aggressive shifting, and hold the appropriate gear longer (and not forever).  You can kind of replicate it with the paddles, but I do miss how the Audi was tuned and its too bad here, because this has a great engine.  The only regret is probably not splurging for the AWD.  The power pretty easily overtakes friction under load and there is mild understeer.  I do get great mileage (averaging 26mpg) in mostly SoCal freeway driving.  That's 2 mpg better than I was getting in the Audi.  The infotainment is fine, but would have been better with at least one knob for volume and power.  No Android/Apple play is a bummer in a vehicle this new and expensive and even though it uses a android based system, the ability to add apps is limited to what Honda will allow you to install, which is right now limited to iHeartRadio.  I would love to install Waze or Pandora or access one of the app stores from the browser.

Day after purchase I drove to Ft Wayne, discovered the car had major vibration issue. Was told they couldnt take it back becasue I had put 200 mls on it myself! Took it in for service and they said they couldnt feel the vibration. I have taken it to two different locations to get opinions and no one can believe this problem was not disclosed before purchasing.  I get online and see hundreds of others going through the same thing. The dealershp said Honda is going to find  a fix, but so far nothing. They said the problem doesnt cause  issues so there is nothing I can do.  I honestly feel the vibration in my body even when I'm not in the car. I drive a lot for my job and concerned that this may be causing me headaches..my arms and hands are itchy when I get out. It vibrates all the time but severely when foot is on break while in drive...the jackhammer name was given by a friend who could not believe Honda is not standing by this..
The management at this store has not contacted me and I bought this in April and have called and left messages, no response. I was deliberately lied to at sales. I am very upset and so disappointed. I don't think this will go without issues arising in other parts of the car with such a problem as this. Never will I trust this dealership again and until Honda takes care of this I will spread the word because YOU do not need to go through this!",neg

"I really wanted to like the Jeep Grand Cherokee. Having come from a similarly sized SUV that treated us well for 12 years, I really wanted to upgrade our technology and other features we didn't have. The dealer let me take the Jeep home for 24 hours to decide. Unfortunately the Jeep drives poorly -- it rolls severly in turns and is not quick or zippy like you'd think given the engine. It also drives like a car much bigger than it is. It doesnt help that the steering wheel is incredibly thick. I dont know how any one would want to drive this day in and day out. It's really too bad because the Jeep does come with a TON of features and is a great value for what you get, from that aspect. And the Jeep LOOKS good. Recommendation is to really make sure you've given it a proper test drive before buying. I was *this* close to buying but decided to take the dealer's offer to drive it for a day.",neg

The hesitation/vibration problem is noticeable (intermittent shuddering as if a wheel is out of alignment and/or the vehicle has just hit a patch of black ice, but related to the newly designed CRV transmission, a problem common to all CRV 2015 that does not yet have a fix) but what really stunned me was a sudden EXTREMELY HIGH REV when going down a small hill. I was braking lightly at the time. It happened again a week later going up a small hill without brake.  It didn't last very long, but the engine raced so completely out of control that the vehicle did not feel safe.  The noise was incredible. I returned the car to the dealership.",neg
"The car was bought new 2015.  Its been recalled for 3 different things.  It accelerated on its own to the point where I have almost hit people. I was not aware the car would just take off on its on.  That was somewhat taken care of during the recall.  
It downshifts on its own(sounds like its going to blow up) I was told this is normal but I don't think so.  It hesitates when you go from a stop to anywhere! I've almost been hit too many times to count. Its a death trap and I have no choice but to drive this car with my children until my lease is up.

"Owner of a 2014 (and past 2004) Pilots...lease is coming up next year on the '14 so asked my sales manager bud if I could keep a '16 for a number of days. Long relationship and I've bought 7 other Acura's/Honda's from him - it does pay to stay loyal! In short, I'm not going to get one. Appearance - looks like a CRV on steroids or any of the other mid-SUV's out there. I've also shun Acura until they get over their ""the gaudier the better"" styling philosophy. Yes, it does drive and feels more solid on the road vs. the '14; however road noise, ever the Achilles Heel of anything this corporation produces, is still omnipresent. My '02 GMC pickup is still quieter! The interior gets a 10 for overall styling and material improvements, a 7 for an over-busy dash/electronics (Consumer Reports just hammered Honda for their e-systems), a 1 for making the driver area ""tighter"" in both height and width, and a -6 for removing the high-center console and replacing with those el-cheapo arm rests from their parts bin.

So, overall I'm disappointed with their efforts here - and I note here are not many glowing reviews on this and other boards. My dealership buddy says reception has been lukewarm with a number of people saying it's more like an ""Odyssey with a longer snout"". Hopefully Honda will hear some of these words and make further refinements. They finally did revise the Civic following an outpouring of criticism.

Happy New Year!",neg
"Not only was I taken on the lease, I am shocked how cheaply this car made compared to previous 2006 Forester i owned. The interior is all cheap hard plastic, the car sides bend with pressure of one finger, like a cheap car i had in 1990’s not like previous Subaru. This one already has bad scratch on back because rear has no real bumper but cheap plastic, last one had hard rubber there which showed nothing after hitting garbage can. I got it with all the expensive “safety’ features, but it lacks the most important one, blind spot monitoring.  Over all paid fortune, cheated by dealer, and wound up with car that  exemplifies cliche of lipstick on pig",neg

"I switched brands from Chrysler to Honda - based on their reliability ratings. Well let me tell you, throw those ratings right out the window. I traded in a Ram1500 and a Jeep Compass for TWO Honda CR-V's. One is an LX, other is an EX, both AWD. The EX has already experienced a dead battery - left me stranded after only 6 weeks of ownership, something that has never happened to me before in all my years of driving, and I am 64 years old. The dealer replaced the battery, but I still feel like something else might be wrong - - the electronic dashboard keeps doing goofy things. Also, this vehicle is plagued my countless rattles. The other one - the LX, is also plagued by countless rattles, and is at times, hard to start. The only good things I can say at this time, is the vehicles are roomy, and do get good MPG's. I personally prefer the 2.4 engine in the LX, over the 1.5 turbo in the EX. For Honda's so called great reputation, I am highly DISSAPPOINTED, in these 2 CR-V's.

Buyers beware: Purchased AWD EX-L model two weeks ago. Noticed oil on garage floor. Oil leaking from rear differential (AWD model).

"I drove around a CRV and loved it which was why I didn't spend much time researching when I traded in my 2015 GMC Crew Cab for the 2016 Pilot (I put a ton of miles on my vehicles so I trade them in before I hit 30k) I miss that truck dearly loved loved it!!! ... Anyway the first major problem I can't handle is the blue tooth ... It is terrible!!! I can't hold a conversation with anyone because they can't hear me and vise versa. According to them there is a ton of background noise I either have to pull over or take them off Bluetooth. 2nd the stereo is sub standard. My 2013 Kia Sportage was superior to this stereo system and that car was half this price. 3rd) the touch screen is VERY sensitive and I'm always pressing too close to another option and it goes to something else (hard to explain) but I NEVER had any problem with my GMc touch screen. It also just seems too busy oh and fingerprints are a terrible issue!! In the gleam of the light sometimes I can't even see behind them (and I clean it all the time.. Because I have to 😉) Also, the third row isn't easy to put down and up. The system seems antiquated and cumbersome. THIS VEHICLE IS VERY SLOW. Even when I take the Econ option off its very slow. It drives like a van and you sit like your in a van (I've driven a Nissan Quest and it was more 'fun' than driving this) so if you have back problems I advise you truly test it out for awhile. If I drive it for over an hour my psyatic nerve starts to bother me. I'm 5'7"" and weigh 135.  also, it's not as quiet of a ride as I expected. My truck was quieter and so was my Kia. Honestly the only thing about it that's a plus is the gas mileage. I average 22.4mpg. But that's the only plus and over everything else I would pay the gas difference in a heart beat to drive an expedition again. (I've driven them too) I hope this helps, everyone is different but I've heard that there have been a lot of bad reviews of this vehicle and I'm sure Honda will iron them out for the next years model or at least I hope so!! I will be trading this one in asap and its to the point I don't care how much money I loose in doing so. 😢 I also advise against the grey leather...

"The 2016 Honda Pilot is almost a perfect car except that it has major, major transmission problems that aren't readily evident in just a test drive.  We just purchased a 2016 Honda Elite and the transmission really is a mess.  It can't find gears correctly, when on a downhill and you brake the car actually speeds up because it upshifts while you are braking, there are head-jerking episodes that are unexplained, when trying to climb hills it downshifts so much that you actually fight the car to try to get it up the hill.  We are so disappointed I can't even tell you.  We paid $51,000 for this car at a Honda dealer in Northern Virginia and it only has 265 miles on it and my wife refuses to drive it anymore.  She was in tears at the dealership and they, so far, have taken no ownership of the problem.  By the way, if you think that this is just us then go and look at other reviews on forums for the Pilots on the Internet. It is known that the 9 speed has a real problem.  Honda does not seem to be addressing this which is shocking given that it is happening on the 2 highest end models -- Touring and Elite.  But I'm getting the feeling that they don't care or don't know how to fix it.  With literally just 265 miles on the car we have listed it for sale.  We are going to take a major loss on this car and get rid of it right away.  I have nothing but the worst feelings about Honda as a company and brand.  Do not buy this car.  Do not buy this car.",neg
"As said in the other reviews, the infotainment system doesn't work and the voice commands are very frustrating and dangerous to use. Honda refuses to update the infotainment system with Android Auto. My 2016 Honda Pilot EX-L with 4WD and Honda Sensing cost $40,000 and does not have a CD player or NAV, and in retrospect it unfortunately is not a good value. I like the six speed transmission, and Honda Sensing has already paid for itself by preventing two accidents. But after yelling at the voice commands for a year my wife wanted me to trade in the Pilot on a Toyota Highlander. The dealer only offered me $30,000 for the Honda, so I guess I'm stuck with it. Woof! It's a dog. Do yourself a favor and buy a Toyota Highlander instead, it has a nicer interior, drives almost as well and has an easy to use infotainment system.",neg

I found they both had pretty equal safety packages, which was important.

"I've always purchased Toyota Tacoma or the 4runner, but was not impressed with the latest version of 4Runner. I always bought Tacoma for resale. That said, the Jeep GC has caught my the last two years. I loved the way it 'looked'. My impressions previously were that they were unreliable. I test drove it and was shocked at the materials, fit and finish, and quietness. Felt like an uber luxury SUV. I just couldn't get over how quiet. After doing some research I decided to go with the Summit. So far, I'm supremely impressed. It's a beautiful vehicle and the ride is awesome. Gas mileage is ok. not great. It's inline with what is advertised. The U Connect is awesome and leaps better than Toyota's Entune. My only hope is that long term reliability is ok and resale is good. I eliminated the risk of reliability by purchasing the extended service contract, but the future resale is in the hands of the market. I have to say I'm surprised by the compliments I get on this thing. More in two months than in the years of my toyotas. Personal note, I'm glad I found an American car that I'm happy with.

This is a nice ride.  I traded in an Avalanche pickup that was deluxe. The Highlander is as comfortable as the Avalanche and has as much interior room.

"I purchased my Jeep  2015 Grand Cherokee Laredo last September 2015, and I was very happy about it cause I was purchasing an American made vehicle. It was my first jeep. After driving for one day, I went back to the dealership service department to find out what that little motor sounding noise was under the hood. Don't you know that no one there could tell me what it was? This sound comes and goes and I was stuck living with it thinking it was just something normal about it. Then after driving for a week or two, I felt as thought I was driving a manual car. When slowing down and coming to a stop, the transmission would shift kind of weird. As it was shifting down and I could feel that jerky motion it in my head and it was making me motion sick. This went on for a while and I wasn't sure what to do. So I took it to service where it was determined that my car needed a ""software update"". But after getting my car back, it was back to the same old thing. So I wrote to jeep about the problem and was told to take it back to service. So I did just that and I had two service people drive with me while I drove my car. The first person tried to blame the problem on the road surface. But then the second person, who told me that he too experienced motion sickness during his life and he drove with me and I told him about the transmission and how it was kind of jerky when I slow and brake to a stop. He told me that Jeep had changed their transmission to eight speed and that eventually will be going to a nine speed transmission. And these are his words, ""the new transmission is more jerky"". I had to agree with him. So after this, Jeep consumers office contacted me and told me that they were unable to help me because my car was okay and there was nothing to repair. What a joke I thought. I spend all this money for a lousy car that I thought was high quality when in fact it wasn't. Since I couldn't drive this car anymore, I had to trade it in for a more reliable ""Japanese"" car and I know I'll be happy with it. And at lease I won't have to get ""software updates"" for it. I'm so happy with that. Jeep, you're history for me!!!",neg
"This is my second Highlander. The first was an 2003 LE. I recently gave it to my daughter with 139000 miles on it. Because I loved my 03 so much, we decided the new car would also be a Highlander. This time we went all out and purchased the Limited Platinum. This car has 4 owners manuals! I've made it through them all. This car has all the bells and whistles! I particularly am enjoying the blind spot warning, lane departure and the cruise control feature that keeps you a safe distance from the car in front of you. I must admit this took a little getting used to, but now I truly appreciate the way the car speeds up or slows down on its own while using the cruise feature. The lift gate is also easy to operate. You must use the operating handle, but you don't need to manually unlock the door first if you are keeping the key in your purse. I do like the easy lock/unlock features on the doors as well. The interior is very attractive, spacious and comfortable. I love that I can fit my tote style handbag safely away in the deep storage unit between the front seat! It's also wide enough for me to fish around for anything I need in my bag, and there is also roo, for me to store all my favorite CDs in there as well. The back seat captains chairs are very comfortable and ride very well. There are retractable window shades for added comfort. This is great for traveling with babies! We haven't even used the third row seats, but they are ready when needed. The cargo area without the third row is very spacious! Four adults could easily travel with all their luggage for at least a week or more including beach chairs and coolers! The entune system is great! It has local weather, traffic,Bluetooth pairing for listening to your favorite music on your phone, or on the apps you can install such as i❤️radio, Pandora, and others. You get a three month subscription to Sirius. The navigation system will not allow you to get lost! It reconfigures if you miss a turn without making you feel bad, it simply and redirects you without that annoying ""recalculating"" you get with other system. I love the sunny interior when you unshaded the cabin with the panoramic moon roof. I just love my new car, and am looking forward to many years of pleasurable driving!",pos
"We now have about 13K miles on the Toyota and remain disappointed in our purchase. We have had continual bouts with the radio/nav system just completely shutting down (in the middle of a route) and restarting - I mean the radio shuts off! The fact that the nav screen is not recessed or protected results in a glare that make the screen at time unusable. In addition the bluetooth will arbitrarily cut off and not reconnect unless the car is stopped. I have read other reviews and other owners have reported the same problem with the radio and despite 2-3 replacements the radio is still doing the same thing so I'm not sure what our options are. As stated earlier the sun roof is virtually unusable from a noise perspective because when open the wind noise is so significant you can't carry on a conversation. I believe this has to do with the placement of the luggage rack in conjunction with the angle of the roof (poor engineering)That said its a ""practical"" vehicle and we have appreciated the all-wheel drive in the bad weather.",neg
"This is my sixth Subaru since the early 90's.  The Forester has been reliable, but I'm not certain of its long term durability.  This is a 1.5 year old car with rattles, a jumpy transmission and a poorly designed and constructed interior.  Center console is trashed.  USB ports are designed so any accessory cord breaks the port.  Accelerator is problematic and very touchy.

"Day after buying my Jeep Cherokee Latitude, I was driving to work and I get low oil pressure warning and car loses all pickup. Bring it to dealership the next day to find out that the connection that hold the oil filter on was cracked and spewing oil. After they fix that I notice the transmission slips on stop and go and when going from reverse into drive. Bring it back to dealership (2nd visit in less than a week of owning the Jeep). They assure me that the oil issue and the transmission are not connected. After keeping the car all day they tell me the computer isn’t giving them any errors to which I respond by telling them to drive it and tell me that there’s nothing wrong with it…. I get a call back the next day saying that they would do a transmission adjustment which takes a while and may not make a difference. When I pick it up I’m told, “The transmission has to learn your driving habits so that it can adjust to you and it will get better over time”. After diving a short distance I notice a slight difference but the issues were still there. Now I’ve got about 5500 miles on it and I notice a rattle under the car when it starts and a high pitched noise when sitting idle. The transmission is worse than ever. Backing out of my driveway is a daily adventure wondering if it’s going to engage smooth or slip and bang into gear jerking the car forward. When going up minor hills it will drop from fourth or fifth gear to first or second gear and send the RMP’s between 4k – 5k and making it sound like I’m trying to Evil Knievel the hill. If you do some research you’ll see that this is a common problem (transmission). I’ve going to be bringing it back to the dealership asking for some serious answers. I’d recommend that anyone interested in this vehicle wait another year or two until they figure the transmission out. Right now we’re the guinea pigs paying hard earned money to do their testing for them….",neg

You have to find out whether there was a fix, go to a dealer, tell them that there is a fix, they will deny it. Go back with proof.

"We bought the 2016 Forester base model with 6 speed for the great vision out of the interior, interior space and manual trans. No other small SUV offers all that. We went to the San Francisco car show and sat in every single offering in this segment. They all were very nice vehicles but it came clear real quickly that many were lacking for what we wanted. neither my wife or I like sitting in a ""pod"" with a tall and full length console beside us. It feels inhibiting and makes the interior seem much smaller than it is. The Subaru was the clear winner here as it is very welcoming and plenty of room with a much lower console area. Their is a significant larger amount of glass and the view out the rear is superior. The CRV and Escape were awful for the rear/side view. The RAV has an odd stadium seating setup which combined with the sunroof makes for inhibited view from the rear. We also enjoyed that the base model Forester did NOT have a sunroof....which takes away headroom and again tightens interior dimensions. Last we wanted a manual trans. We both enjoy them and believe we are more engaged as drivers when using one. Indeed the Forster is the only one offering a manual save Mazda (If I remember correctly).

"This is my first and last Subaru.  I have a 2015 Forester.  Bought it for the turbo.  Accelleration is great, but the touring suspension is firm, leading to a lousy ride.  Bluetooth rarely works the way it should - drops calls all the time.  Interior quality is terrible.  Vinyl on driver's seat is cracking.  Dealer blamed me - said it was a sharp object in my pocket.  It's a four inch rip - looks like a 20 year old car.  Brakes are terrible.  I hit them at high speeds and the rumble and shake.  Dealer said they were working fine.  It has been reliable, but the quality just isn't there.  Seat belts with child car /booster seats are hard to fasten - so much for kid friendly cars.  Maybe dogs are happier in Subarus.  Paint is thin and the steel dents easily.  Subaru dealers think they have good customer service, but they really don't.  I've waited three hours for an oil change (and that's with an appointment).  I'll be going back to driving Chevys again.",neg

"I bought my Pilot in November 2015. Out the gate I have had problems with the entertainment system. Problems consist of hands free button not recognizing my voice, dropped calls, people saying it sounds like I'm in a wind tunnel (even though all the windows are up and A/C is off), radio stations not showing on the display, voice recognition system not being able to distinguish what name is being said, system randomly re-booting while driving, calls not being transferred to car system. There are more problems but I think you get the idea. I have an Iphone 6S (IOS 10.2.1). I have also tried paring a Samsung and LG phones to the system and still the problems exist. In the last 6 months I have had the entire info system replaced, the FM receiver replaced, and 2 software updates. Problems still exist. I have a case open with Honda USA and now (as of February 24th the dealer is saying that I have to live with the problems with the info system. I will be contacting Honda USA again. No one should have to live with a problem with a new vehicle especially after spending >$35k for the vehicle. In addition to the info system problems I am experience problems with the vehicle locking (or lack there of) while walking away. The dealer has replaced a sensor in the drivers door and a proximity sensor in the car but the problem still exists. Other issues include the wipers malfunctioning and the spin control system kicking in when the vehicle isn't spinning. I have owned Honda's in the past but they did a poor job on the new Pilots.

Update 3/13/17

On March 9, 2017 I was parked in a parking lot waiting for my daughter. As I started the vehicle I received 3 warnings which stated the following: 1) Brake system problem; 2) charging system problem; and 3) Anti-lock brake system problem. I had the vehicle towed to the nearest dealer through the Honda Emergency Road Service. The dealer is still working on the vehicle to figure out the problem.",neg
"Started using oil at around 50000:( Has anyone had issues with rear tires wearing prematurely?? 75000 mile tires only last 30000 miles. The alignment is fine. Owned a 92 Legacy, best car I ever owned. Thought Subaru was the best, guess I was wrong!!",neg
"I'll start with the good: Once it actually starts delivering power the 3.2 V6 has adequate power and returns good fuel mileage. The ride is quiet and I guess as close to serene as can be expected on-road. The 120v power outlet is nice. Now the bad: Throttle response is all over the place. It's impossible to drive this car smoothly because the throttle's behavior changes all the time based on whatever software decides, so you can't drive this car smoothly or with finesse. A quarter inch of foot movement might mean gentle acceleration one moment but then the same quarter inch of foot movement might mean vigorous acceleration another time because the car's software decided to react differently. That would almost be tolerable, except the 9 speed transmission is a joke. For one thing 9th gear isn't even possible below 80mph. But more crucially, the transmission doesn't shift like normal automatics, there are a couple shifts where you have absolutely no power for two or more seconds while it makes up its mind on what it's going to do. This is infuriating and unsafe. Even if I loved the rest of this vehicle, I would loathe it for the transmission. The car has a ton of ""Features"" but they're imbecilic, like a huge glass roof (the whole roof) with a roof rack above it? What's the point of that I can't put cargo on the glass and if I put a basket over the glass I can't see out so what is the point of the glass? It's stupid. I can start the car from the internet 1000 miles away... but what good does that do? That's ridiculous. I would rather if the car just had a transmission that didn't make me want to kill myself.",neg
I love it... just wish I could have afforded the power seat package like my other cars..   I have had four back surgeries and believe it or not... it is hard for me to bend and reach the manual lever and adjust the seat,pos
"I dont like this car. The seats are uncomfortable especially in this class. The radio is a nightmare to operate(Really Honda, zero buttons!?!?). It is capable of slightly above average performance if you enjoy mashing the throttle and holding it to the floor (Read has zero torque).  For the just below touring model to not have the good headlights is a crime( the running lights fool you into thinking you have HID's, just wait until the first drive in the dark!)
Fuel economy is not impressive. 
I rated value 3 out of 5 because of Honda reliability. Actual value for the money (based on enjoyment of said vehicle, 1 out of 5) I cant believe something that costs this much is so lacking in comfort and convenience. 
I know that Ford and dodge have to distract you with gadgets to get you into their cars, but my 2013 Flex (ecoboost!)had a much better driver/passenger experience. Its just a shame Ford and Dodge allow giant corporate style monopolies to run their dealerships as I would be pleased to drive their offerings. Thankfully the Honda dealership experience has been great so far.",neg
"Just recently purchased a new Forester Limited 2.5, my first Subaru. The seats are very comfortable, ride is VERY smooth, yet suspension doesn't feel sloppy. Many vehicles that takes bumps well give up on handling prowess. This Forester does not. This vehicle turns on a dime and feels very confident during spirited driving. In fact, I'd say this turning radius is better than my BMW 330i. The steering feedback is good too. It is not as tight as the CX5, but just felt better to me.  I believe Subaru tuned the 2017 and 2018 to have shorter travel on steering which makes it very easy and fun to drive. My BMW on the other hand is so tight you need two hand when turning fast making it less easy to drive...especially in parking lots.

I read reviews on this vehicle and I cannot believe the number of people that say this vehicle lags behind others in its class on interior design. First off, that is subjective. Secondly, I prefer the clean, Zen layout. I am not a fan of the busy, buttons everywhere style on some...like the Rav4 and Equinox. And the praised CRV with the shifter high on the dash instead of the floor. I don't think that looks good. One point I would agree is I wish it had Android and Apple play. Otherwise, the Infotainment system works great. 

One area the Forester conclusively wins is visability. No vehicle in its class can compare. Big windows everywhere. It feels very big inside. I also test drove the Outback and Crosstek and the Forester just felt more roomy and comfortable. 

I also saw where some said it was slower than some in its class. I didn't test drive them all, but I find it is plenty quick for merging onto a highway...and remember I also drive a BMW 330i. And if one needs more power there is a turbo version. But then you will need to use premium gas and lose mpg efficiency. No thanks on that. The 2.5 has enough for normal driving.",pos

"I can't stop raving about my new Highlander! I saw the Pilot and MDX at the dealers and read a lot about the other competitors, Explorer, Traverse, Acadia, etc.  It has more standard features than the base level MDX or even a comparable Pilot - for example, to get the 2nd row Captain's Chairs in the Pilot you have to go to the highest trim level or to get the Honda Sensing safety features you have to pay 1,000, also Navigation is extra (at least on the EX-L). I love all the standard safety features that are included in the Toyota (collision mitigation, lane departure warning, blind spot monitoring, etc.) and it comes with optional Captain's Chairs (which are very comfortable) on the XLE. Yes, the 3rd row seating is smaller than the Pilot but we don't intend to use it that often and when we do it will be mainly for children so that was not a big issue for us. The rear seat cargo room when the 3rd row is up is smaller than the Pilot but again, we don't anticipate that being a big issue and I believe it is bigger than the other cars in this class. The fuel economy is what you would expect for a car of this size and weight. I did not get the AWD on purpose because we don't need it and it just adds expense, but having said that, finding a FWD was very hard - I call my car the ""unicorn"" because it was so hard to find. I look forward to driven this car every time I get into it!",pos
"Extremely comfortable.  Good looking.  Proven reliability.  This SUV is great.  Zero complaints.  I did not like the Honda Pilot interior, nor the past reliability, nor the ""new"" engine, transmission of the Pilot.  Still zero complaints after almost 2 years, 22,000 miles.",pos

Honda,you need to offer all safety on EXL model. You did away with the EXL Limited trim!

New Honda Pilot was a disapointment to me.. I bought from a different manufacturer. 
Troy Doder was a very knowledgeable sales person at Gillman Honda. He knows the Honda products; however the Honda Pilot is not the vehicle I wanted. If I wanted a pick up, Troy knows the Ridgeline. I wanted a Pilot... but not 2018 Pilot.",neg
"When the vehicle was new, we were very happy with it. It wasn't until we were stranded for 3 hours do to a transmission failure with 10,500 miles on the vehicle that we found out just how unreliable it would be. The Jeep was towed to a local Jeep dealer for repair. They provided excellent service by the way; five computer modules were upgraded and the problem appeared to be corrected. A day later, the problem reappeared, died while on a highway, and the vehicle went back to the shop. This time they determined that it would need a valve on the transmission that had failed. 
The unreliability of a vehicle with only 10,500 miles made me very nervous for the future. My wife and I were visiting Florida at the time and the thought of driving 1,400 miles to get home to upstate New York with a vehicle that could shut down any time during the trip prompted us to trade the vehicle immediately. To make matters worse, we lost half the value of the purchase price by trading a 9 month old vehicle, but felt that we had no choice! I have been a loyal  Chrysler/Jeep owner for many years but am severing my ties with Blevins dealership and any Chrysler products. It's obvious that Chrysler uses inferior components as evidenced by the multitude of people complaining on the internet of the same problem as we experienced.",neg

"The transmission is horrible and the dealership says it is as designed and make no effort to correct the problem.  Our 16 year old was driving it and at times it would lurch foreword for no reaso, it is an accident waiting to happen.  The shift lever is easy to bump and if a passenger turns to the back seat it is easy to knock it from drive to neutral.  There is no lockout.  The fuel mileage is horrible, worse than my Challenger 5.7 Hemi, and the stall feature at stops is dangerous considering when you start the transmission can lurch foreword.  The Navigstion is inaccurate and inferior to the Dodge as is the entertainment package.  The Cargo area is small and the seats uncomfortable.  The car is a nuicense and a safety hazard and resale shows how poor the car is.  We just traded it in on a Chevy because, in my opinion,  it is too dangerous to drive.  This car also has unending recalls resulting in uncompensated lost work and expense taking it to an uncaring dealer.",neg
"We bought our 2016 Crystal Black Silica Forester LTD in January of 2016.   We had not looked at a Forester as we deemed it too much of a ""Family"" car.  One that Men don't usually drive!  (Sorry!)    But having reached the end of our ropes with other makes and models with one short-coming or another, we decided, OK, the Forester is EVERYWHERE, there MUST be a reason.  Well yeah there is! It is one great car and so much like my old 2003 Jeep Wrangler with utilitarian ways but OH SO stylish and elegant as well and the Harmon-Kardon 440a sound system rocks!      This ride is one great ride and the quality (at every glance and every turn I find another little special detail!)  is totally off the map. They didn't miss anything.   We love it and we'll probably buy another.   It's so much better than my 1984 Subaru 4x4 Turbo wagon!  That thing was a story in itself!  It was awful.

"If I can get you to understand one thing and only one thing,  it's DO NOT get a Cherokee unless it has factory towing AND the Trailhawk package.  

You can't add towing later to a unit that doesn't have the factory tow package.     I wish someone had told me that. 

The Trailhawk is the only model that actually has recovery points, at all..  so if you slide off the road in snow or get stuck in mud (this is an SUV after all right?) there's seriously not one thing to hook a tow strap onto front or rear on non-trailhawks.    Nothing.    You're screwed.   

This is a useless car for a lot of reasons,  and the biggest purchase regret of my life but I won't go into all the things I loathe about it - just... if you absolutely have to buy one of these stupid cars at least insist on towing and Trailhawk or you'll have a sack of garbage like mine.",neg
"I purchased a new 2015 Honda CRV in August 2015. I had read a review that stated it was the SUV of the year and some other publications seem to echo good quality... However it turns out there is a known issue with the 2015 version of the CRV that causes the car to vibrate. Its a issue with the new CVT and engine combination they used in the 2015 version of the CRV.  

I only test drove the car for a short time and did not notice the issue but it turns out that if you have the lights on and the AC on full you will not notice as it forces the car to be in a higher RPM range (all the time). I test drove this in the summer and so the AC was on. The day I went in to sign the final paperwork for the car I asked about the vibration issues as I had read some real reviews from real customers complaining about it and was told its nothing to worry about.  Well turns out that when it got colder I started to have more and more of the vibrations. I took the car in multiple times to have them try to fix it. None of the fixes completely resolves the issue it just makes them less noticeable. I even had the newest fix done in December 2015 where they had to replace parts of the car... to try and fix all 3 modes of the issue... Still not fixed this car was too expensive to just deal with. A 30k car should be basically perfect, thats premium car price range.

If I had been told the about the issue by the dealer I would not have purchased this car. I would have happily purchased the HRV or maybe even an accord. Now I have lost hours and hours of my life researching this issue and taking it in to get it fixed and its still not. I also asked the dealer if they would trade the CRV and they said they would not since they would then have to deal with it.  They also just told me to talk to Honda directly. (I am in contact with Honda directly now we will see where that goes...)

So to be fair this is in part Honda's issue but it was also the dealer that did not disclose the information to me. Otherwise the dealer did a decent job... price was average and they were nice enough but that does not matter given my car is not what I expected. I can't stand the vibration personally (some people claim to not notice). I am now going to have to take a loss of thousands of dollars trading it in on something else that does not vibrate. 

Take a look at what people on crvownersclub.com search form for ""CRV 2015 vibration""   I am not the only one...",neg
The passenger does not have full power front seat as the driver does. Very important to have the power lumbar and to raise the seat up!  And we do NOT want 3rd row.

"I have only had vehicle since March - no winter driving yet (live in Minnesota). The computer/transmission is current on recall updates except R27 (liftgate fire possibility).  So there are no transmission updates pending.  But, the vehicle has minimal deceleration with no trottle, and downhill on ice seems like it will be a real safety issue.  Going down hill with no trottle, tach gains RPM, and vehicle continues to accelerate dangerously if brake is not applied.  Putting transmission into ""manual"" control (say 3rd gear as top gear) does not help at all.  After reading the various reviews about transmission issues, it seems pretty worthless to talk to service people or customer reps.  I think maybe lawyers may be needed to shake these people up before we start seeing fatalities because of this poorly thought-out design.  Fiat-Chrysler should be buying them back.

"Strike 1- Styling, It simply looks like every other vehicle on the road. The interior is more of a mini van than SUV. There is no center arm rest or large storage area as in previous Pilots. It has mini van style arm rests.  Strike 2 - Too much unnecessary electronics such as the touch screen audio, push button start and electric tailgate.  (Are people really that lazy that they can not open and close the tailgate)  Strike 3 - Handling. This vehicle does not handle well. The steering is light and does not seem strong enough for a vehicle this size and weight. There is also a weird bottom weight feel. Out here in the country where I live, we have lots of winding roads. I have never had any car or truck handle so poorly and with so much body roll. There is no confidence when driving.  In my opinion, Honda has taken several steps backwards with the 2016 Pilot. It is not an improvement from the last 2 generations.",neg

"I purchased my 2017 Honda CRV Touring AWD in June 2017. The day I went to take delivery the salesman was doing his walk around with me and showing me how to operate the car. They were all ready to let me drive off the lot when I pointed out that the drivers seat bolster was malformed and deflated. The mechanic comes out and says they never saw anything like that. So I take the car home and make an appointment to drop it off so they can disassemble the seat to find out what is wrong. After 3 days they get the parts and put the seat back together. I go to pick it up. They seat is ok. Not perfect and the nice tan leather interior is covered in black greasy hand prints. So they bring another guy out to clean it. Which should have been done before I even got there. Fast forward 6 months and it is time for the 5000 mile check up and oil change. I tell them I have been hearing lifter noises and a strange whining from the transmission. After an hour in the waiting room they take me out to the garage to show me the underneath of new car covered in some kind of fluid that is leaking from somewhere under the motor. They don't know what kind of fluid it is. So I have to leave my car while they try to figure out what is wrong with it. A week later I get a call saying they think it is oil and it is the rear main seal. They tell me it was probably like that since my last change, at which time I point out that this is the first oil change on my new car so they say it was probably installed wrong at the factory and has been leaking like that since I got it new off the lot. They also tell me they don't know what they sounds are that I was hearing. So I guess I was hearing things! 3 weeks later they finally have the car back together and are going to drive it for 50 miles and make sure that there is no more leak. I opened up a case with Honda Motor Corp. because I have serious doubts about the reliability of this vehicle since it has been like this since the factory how do I know what kind of damage it has suffered internally? They mechanics say they didn't see any metal chips in the oil but I still don't trust them. I will be getting rid of this car. I don't trust. Honda Quality has gone right done the toilet.",neg
"I'm used to truck-based SUV's having owned 2 Toyota 4Runners, a Mercedes G-500, and a bunch of  first gen FJ-40 Landcruisers, so to drive the Highlander is almost effortless. The one thing I have to worry about is the long length and wheelbase, which is longer than any of the other cars that I have ever owned. On the other hand, if I keep the mindset that I'm driving a truck or bus, like I used to do for a living, I'll be OK. But I have have never driven anything as smooth and comfortable!",pos
"At 4000 miles breaks began to pulsate violently. dealer had to replace brake rotors. At the time of the brake repair I had mentioned to the service Manager of the erratic shifting and hesitation, but because there were no error codes the service dept shoved it off like no big deal. 3000 miles later check engine light with again erratic shifting. At one point transmission disengaged and engine reved to 5000 RPM. Back to the dealer, replaced PCM but said it was faulty, ordered and replaced with another PCM, but service Manager said that they could not reprogramm. It has been at the Dealership now for two weeks with no cure insight. They now have Chrysler Tech group working on the problem, but they too have been unsuccessful in figuring out the problem. Makes me feel all warm a fuzzy about driving this Vehicle again if they ever get it fixed. Of course the dealership offered to get me into another Vehicle but would have to add the $3500 negative equity in my jeep to the cost of a new Vehicle. This Vehicle is a danger on the road, and the BIGGEST LEMON I HAVE EVER OWNED!!!",neg
"I recommend that a potential buyer should compile lists of their ""must haves"", might like to have and ""don't need"" features and options. During my shopping the finalists were Honda CR-V and Subaru Forester. With Honda their is very little room for building in your feature choices...the models are limited and each is ""set"" with its package of features- nice if you don't like making decisions. The Forester, on the other hand, has a larger selection of models to choose from so that you can customize the features AND price to your needs. Make sure to ask for the one page ""breakdown"" of the models and what comes with each. Furthermore you can get a more detailed listing of what is offered with each model on their website. I think in all my years of car buying this was the most informed decision I've been able to make. My experience with the sales staff was excellent. They know their cars and are straight forward in their approach- no ""hocus pocus"" with their answers and no pressure to buy instantly.",pos
Have seen the adds and after a test drive leased the vehicle. First time leasing will find out if this was a good choice in 36 months. Vehicle has crash avoidance system. I love it. With cruise control activated vehicle will automatically slow when you approach the vehicle on front of you and maintain a safe distance until the vehicle moves and then will accelerate to pre-set speed. No more tapping the brake and re-engaging. Vehicle handles well and has a great sound system. Controls and features are very intuitive.,pos

"I have been in the market for a small SUV for a while now.  I have driven all of the major players - CR-V, CX-5 and the Forester. I am a long-time Honda person.  I liked the CX-5 but it was a bit more cramped inside and the visibility was not as good.  The CR-V drove well and had the best CVT behavior but just left me a bit uninspired due to its bland nature.  I drove the 2016 Forester and liked it - I have two other family members with Foresters who love them.  I found out the 2017 model with a mild refresh was on its way so I waited until they took the first one off the truck at my local dealership (Cannon Subaru in Lakeland is great!).  I test drove the 2017 back to back with a 2016 they still had on the lot and the difference was significant as far as solidity, smooth ride and much quieter ride.  The new infotainment system was intuitive and easy to use with volume and tuning KNOBS along with a touch screen - compared to the the CR-V's system (a disaster of confusing touch screen with no knob controls!) and the CX-5 which had the frustrating center toggle knob - the Subaru system is much better. The sound quality of the non-upgraded stereo is adequate - meets or exceeds the others in this category.  The Forester drives very smoothly and has a solid, quality feel inside and out.  The AWD system provides an extra level of stability to the handling.  The only small issue is the CVT.  Subaru has tweaked the CVT for the 2017 model to attempt to smooth its operation and it is better but still takes some adjustment - this is my first CVT equipped automobile - it is just a different feel and takes adjusting how you drive to a more easy application of the accelerator which gives smooth, linear acceleration (and surprisingly fast!) but driving aggressively with lots of slamming the pedal down - like I was used to doing with the normal automatic equipped small Honda engine automobiles - results in a much worse driving experience with the CVT - I am adjusting and think I'll enjoy the smoothness once I drive a while.  If you have never owned a CVT vehicle, I suggest a good test drive to see if you like it - although, your choices are becoming slimmer as most of the major manufacturers are switching to the CVT for its MPG advantages as they attempt to meet the new government requirements.  Overall, I would highly suggest you put the 2017 Subaru Forester on your list if you are looking for a solid, reliable, safe small SUV.

***UPDATE...been driving my Forester now for about 6 months...overall the car is good but one glaring thing has come to light....the powertrain is dismal after a while...the CVT shudders and hesitates at odd times and just is not smooth no matter what you do.  I have not been able to adjust to it to drive smoothly....there is a surge when you begin acceleration and then the ""fake"" shift points kick in...they are not well timed.  And the incredibly ANNOYING shudder that happens as if the CVT belt is slipping...it happens at different speeds and even when cruising on the highway.  I've mentioned it to my dealer and they say others have complained with the 2017 but not really any explanation.  My advice, take this car on a long test drive and really pay attention to the CVT behavior - especially in low speed driving conditions - it will only get worse once you buy it and drive it....other than that, the car handles well and is comfortable and practical but if you are picky about smooth driving, skip this one.

***Update 2:  After much research and chats on online forums for the Forester, I finally spotted a post about the shuddering CVT issue and the fix that one owner got at his dealership - It was a recently released TSB software update from Subaru - I printed a copy with the TSB number and took it to my dealer and asked to have the update done to my Forester - they did it and the shuddering is GONE - simple fix.  I test drove a 2018 out of curiosity and it did not shudder so it appears Subaru has fixed the issue but if you have a 2017 model that shudders, demand to have the software update #11-175-17",pos
"I have had my car for just over 1 year. As I  write this and make a car payment my Latitude is with the dealer having its engine replaced. It has been there since last Wednesday and they are not sure if I will have it back by next week. The dealer's service department has been great. Chrysler's response has been disappointing. I am concerned about this vehicle and have wavering confidence about a safe resolution to my issue. The only way I knew there was an issue was when the car simply stopped working while I was driving. Thankfully, I was not on a major roadway and was able to safely restart and get to the dealership. While a recall may not be in order, I would suggest that Chrysler, at the very least, have each of these vehicles inspected for the defect as I know I am not the only one experiencing this issue. It took only a short Google search to find many who have had the same experience. It is really a shame, as I do like the vehicle.",neg

The only complaints I have are the original tires (which I traded in for Michelin Premier's that were a bit wider which helped the steering response and improved the ride and noise level.

I have had trouble with customer service at both dealerships I've been to and through the Jeep company itself. Several issues with car and I am not impressed with its safety on ice.

"I am 5’1” and needed to replace my SUV.  I looked at a bunch of different 2018 ones, and they all have the “stylish” curved windows which create problems for me: 1.  The curved windows make for blind spots for me, and 2. because I have to pull the seat way forward, unless I back the seat up every time I exit the vehicle, I have to avoid hitting my head on the curved window frame!!

 Not so with the Forester!  I LOVE the  large squared off windows.  I LOVE the large front windshield!  

I was nervous about going from a V-6 to a 4 cylinder, but my Forester has plenty of zip to pull into busy traffic situations, and on the highway!  I like the slightly smaller footprint,  and the better gas mileage.

Invariably, I received great care at reasonable prices with out feeling ripped off as I do when I take my wife's Mercedes in or the BME's I've had in the past.

"This was my first Jeep and at first I was really impressed with it. It is a very solid vehicle with great styling and trim, excellent turning radius, impressive power and it's quiet.

The BlueTooth is a feature I can't live without, but I learned how for the first year I had this thing. They finally got that fixed, but... Over the 2 1/2 years I've owned this, it's been in the shop for transmission issues 4 times, computer issues 4 times, driveability issues another couple of times and if there was ever a vehicle that should have been taken back under the lemon law provisions, this was it. The real kicker was a buildup of water under the passenger's side floorboards which would slosh around constantly while you were driving...it took a year to find and fix that problem. I've had it.

I have about 8K miles on it... and recently have experienced the audio screen going black - only audio - the screen works otherwise.  Honda has no service updates, and has no records of this being an issue on 2017 models - though there is plenty of problems documented on the piloteers board - for earlier models.

"I am in regional Sales and generally replace my Highlanders every three years or so.  My first was a 2004.   I traded my black 70k mi 2014 XLE AWD for a 2017 gray/black LE Plus AWD.   Why the LE Plus over another XLE?  Well, the LE Plus has the features that I use/like the most on the road- power seat, leather wrapped wheel, upgraded audio (excellent sound quality), power lift gate with flipper window, 3 zone auto climate control.  After negotiating my best deal among 3 dealers, the LE Plus was 4K lessthan the XLE (you recoup some of the XLE cost when you sell, though).  The feature that I missed the most initially was keyless entry and go.  This is my first car in 15 years without a sunroof(which I don't really miss).  Really like my LE Plus - I added bodyside moldings, rear bumper protector and all weather mats.  It came with Michelin tires and the ride quality is superior to the deuhler HLs.  The safety sense is a great system, and the lane keeping feature is really neat.  I also like the auto dimming headlamps.   Overall, this Highlander is very comfortable for my 6'2"" frame and I would not hesitate to recommend it- its very reliable and has consistently high resale value.  The quality of the interior materials feels superior to most of its competitors.  I did look at the 2017 Pilot, which is larger, but the seat mounted armrests were uncomfortable and a deal breaker for me.  The interior of the Highlander is much nicer.",pos

Unfortunately, I failed to notice that for 2015, Jeep has eliminated the sporty dual exhausts for the Limited, which is very surprising for their most popular selling model.  Aesthetics were part of my decision for the Grand Cherokee and this is a horrible design decision by Jeep. It cheapens the look of the high-end Limited model down to an ordinary Laredo and ruins the symmetry of the car from the back. Having just shelled over $45K for a Limited, I expected better.

Good looking suv with lots of great features just dangerous to drive when you pull into traffic. Shifts terrible. Even after 6 transmission updates. 2.4 liter engine is weak.

Looking at being at the dealer every 6 months for a new transmission update.,neg
I am already having an issue with my transmission and I haven't even gotten  my permanent plates yet! Getting it looked at tomorrow but I am seriously upset! And it's supposed to be top of the line! I have the touring. When I go down hill it make a crazy winding noise and when I hit the gas it jumps like it's gears are getting stuck. I'm pretty sure I have a lemon. And I was hoping to have this car for the next 10 years. So much for that.,neg
Make sure you know what options you want/need.  Dealers tend to equip floor models with everything and many option you don't need.  Trailer hitch is critical for transporting bikes and I recommend the dealer installed option as the fit and finish is much better than other after market installs.,pos

"Wow... Just picked up my 2014 Highlander this week, and it is awesome! Much different from my 2008 Highlander, eventhough it was great too. I will start by saying this is about the most quiet SUV I have ever been in. Smooth as silk ride. I have most everything that comes with it except the DVD. The leather seats are extremely comfortable , and the driver seat has plenty of seat adjustments. The safety features are fantastic: Lane departure, blind spot, parking assist, auto cruise control, back-up camera with wide screen. The bridgestone tires that mine came with are very quiet, and they look great! The JBL system is sweet, and all the apps are fun to try as well. Easy to use controls are great ! The new 6 speed trans. is very smooth...you hardly feel the trans. shift at all.There is plenty of leg room both front and back, as well as head room. The panoramic sunroof is awesome and lets in alot of light. It is very fun to drive.

"From a man's point of view, I wanted to have only one new vehicle for both intown and cross country travel. This 2017 Highlander LXE replaced a 2009 Highlander AWD Sport with 200K on it that only had one part (less than $400) replaced.  Obviously that vehicle was passed down in the family.  We pull a 4300 pound travel trailer and  with wind and elevation gain the 09 got around 9 to 10mpg at 70mph.  With no bike rack or trailer, it averaged 23-24mpg on the highway.  The 2017 gets around 15mpg pulling the trailer and pulls much easier with the additional HP and speeds.  My wife enjoys all the safety features, GPS and phone system.

"I bought my first Grand Cherokee in 2008 during a time when Daimler-Chrysler offered a limited lifetime warranty on the powertrain.

It is loaded with most of the latest features including driver assist systems, UConnect, leather, sunroof, tow package, etc. It is a pleasure to drive with the V6 having plenty of power - especially in sport or manual mode. Very comfortable and looks sharp! It does not have 3rd row seating but I don't need it. The 3rd row seating version of this vehicle is the Dodge Durango. The cargo area is plentiful, especially with the seats down. The roof rack also provides additional storage capabilities if necessary. Before purchasing this car, I drove SUVs from BMW, Mercedes, GM, and Ford and chose the Jeep again because of the overall value.

"I traded in my 2010 Lexus IS 250 AWD sedan for the sporty 2.0XT Touring Forester and really like it. I did a ton of research on it prior to buying via Internet reviews and YouTube videos. We are mostly Toyota people only because I have never had issues with their vehicles and reliability is hugely important to me. We have a great local dealer in Parker Subaru so I knew I would have a great dealer experience just as I always had at Parker Toyota. The car drives really nicely and I chose the turbo motor because i liked the overall look vs the other trim models and like the zip when I need it- my Lexus had a v6 so this engine is more zippy like my Lexus was. I elected not to add eyesight only because I didn't want to spend anymore on my Forester and decided to get that option on my next Subie as the technology continues to get refined but I got all the other options on my new ride and love the Harmon Kardon stereo upgrade. My wife has a 2015 RAV4 but I have never cared for those even though I'm a big Toyota guy. I still think my new car looks, drives, and just feels more solid than the RAV. I am adding chip repair and also added oil changes to my deal so i won't have to shell out $80 on synthetic oil changes every 5-6k miles on my lease. I chose the Quartz Blue Pearl and absolutely love the color along with the 18"" rims and more aggressive front grill on my trim. I initially was going with a new Honda CRV Touring but glad  I went with the Subaru- it seems like a more stout vehicle for the Northwest roads and weather here in North Idaho. I have a buddy with a 2014 Forester he bought new and it has the Eyesight and he sure loves that feature. He just started selling Subarus over in Seattle and speaks highly of the feature although he is in a bigger city with lots of traffic and I'm not which is also why it wasn't as important to me but wanted to mention it for other shoppers considering adding Eyesight.

"We considered the Honda Pilot, Toyota Highlander and Subaru Outback, the later being considered largely because of it's mileage.  I think we would have been happy with any of the three but we LOVE the Pilot.  I read all the reviews on here and elsewhere panning the touch screen entertainment system and complaining about the 9 speed transmission and while I think I understand the reasons I don't agree.  We have found the touchscreen to be responsive and easy to use, after you get used to it.  It's not extremely intuitive but unless you're just renting the car for a day or two, read the manual.  Once you become familiar with it, it's responsive and easy to use.  It does have a glossy screen and fingerprints can readily be seen which is a little annoying to my wife.  

I would say we chose the Pilot over the Highlander for 3 reasons; the AWD system is superior, there's more space in the 3rd row seats and it gets better gas mileage.   Mileage was part of the reason we only considered the 9 speed but I really stressed over going with that transmission given all the negative comments.  I will say this, it does hunt for gears but it seems that should be expected, I mean it has 9 speeds, all of which are probably passed through before you get to 60 mph.  I don't mean its particularly noticeable accelerating to highway speed, quite the contrary, it's smooth as silk accelerating.  When it's somewhat noticeable is when it is shifting down at lower speeds, more so going down hill.  I don't consider it to be a big issue and I'm satisfied with our choice of the 9 speed.  As for my hoped for mileage advantage, so far we are satisfied there.  We recently went through the better part of a tank of gas on two trips, mostly highway miles.  Over 369.3 miles we averaged 27.02 mpg and no, I'm not relying on the trip computer, said computer claimed 25.5 mpg.  Honestly I expected something more like 24 mpg.  As for the two trips measured; the first was 120 miles from an altitude of 3,500 ft to around 1,200 ft (trip computer listed 29.5 mpg for that leg) and the second was a round trip for the remainder of the miles.  While our average speed for most of the trips was in the 70-75 mph range a good 10 miles was in stop and go traffic (one hour).  We kept the vehicle in ECON mode for most of these miles and I do think that makes a significant difference.  I don't expect this kind of mileage on all our trips but I do think the 26 mpg hwy rating is fair.  I'll let you know what I find in city and combined driving sometime later.

Things I'm not crazy about are the Collision Mitigation system which as others have said is a little touchy, especially if you are a somewhat aggressive driver.   For my wife it's probably perfect but for me it's too sensitive, especially if I'm in heavy traffic.  On the other hand it does have an on/off switch.  Same with the lane keep assist system which at times misreads heavy tar lines as road paint (not frequently but sometimes).  Also, if you forget you have the system on and go to switch lanes without signaling the system will fight you a little.....as I said, it has an on/off switch too.  Overall I like both systems but they can be improved.  Finally, the auto-engine-stop system works fine but if you're somewhat aggressive pulling into traffic from a stop you need turn it off or be aware it's on because there is a slight lag if you're quick off the brake to the gas.  This system had an on/off switch but unlike the other systems mentioned it must be turned off each time you start the car.   Again, this will never be a problem for a cautious driver and it's not very intrusive when it's working but for me, I have to be very aware.  

All in all, this is a VERY fine piece of machinery that has really impressed us.   So far, my wife and I are extremely happy with our choice.  We love the car and would recommend it to anyone considering a suv/cross-over AWD.",pos
I bought this SUV new in 2014. It guzzles oil like crazy. The dealership was no help. Subaru was no help. They kept telling me the oil consumption was normal.

The Good: 1) Great gas mileage, average is 28 locally, 30 on a trip to New York State from Alabama. 2) AWD nice, even in Alabama since we attend events (flea markets, festivals) that require parking in fields. 3) Ground clearance very nice, never scraped anything (curb, steep driveway). 4) Vehicle has a low center of gravity compared to other compact SUVs so it holds the road on curves (probably due to flat Boxer engine).  The Bad: 1) Red dashboard lights are annoying and everywhere (on the doors and console too). 2) Squeak/rattle at highway speeds in dashboard when temperature goes into 30s that gets worse as the temperature drops – goes away starting in 40s and up (dealer uncertain as to fix). 3) No parts made in the United States, so much for supporting local industry. 4) Cabin noise creates a problem for someone in the back seat who is expected to participate in conversations between people sitting in front seats.  The Ugly: 1) Front seats very comfortable for wife, very uncomfortable for daughter. 2) While safety tests put the vehicle near the top of compact SUVs, the Death Rate in the vehicle (IIHS) is about at the national average for vehicles. 3) Fold-down rear split seats allow hauling, but the seats do not fold completely flat – there is a troublesome bump that can damage items (loog IKEA boxes). 4) Uses regular gasoline, but requires full-synthetic engine oil. 5) Although engine has lots of room to maneuver for servicing, dealer says some quick-lubes have confused the oil and transmission drain plugs and caused major transmission problems that require a prolonged fight to get reimbursed for damage. Overall, so far a good vehicle, and I would consider buying another. Wife is thrilled with the vehicle and says it is the first vehicle she has made payments on that she is happy about making the payment. So you know what our next vehicle is likely to be – that is how we stayed married for 38 years.",neg
"I've had too many issues since buying my 2016 Jeep Cherokee Sport 11 months ago! It leaks on the back floor on the passenger side every time it rains.  I now have water and mold because I live in Florida where its hot! It's stalled on me twice when leaving the parking lot! There is a clicking noise in the front when I turn the wheel. The gas pedal has a wobble when I'm stopped and then accelerate to take off, but it doesn't happen every time. Scary! When I Googled it, it has something to do with the transmission needs to be tightened. Oh! and my tires keep losing air! Constantly putting air in the tires!  I've taken it to the dealership to see if they can make me a happy camper again. I have my doubts.  I feel like I bought a Lemon!!!  I will update again if they resolve all the issues!",neg
"I rated it so low because I purchased this car for its hands-free features and only 4 older model phones work with it other than 6 older model iPhones and Honda has not updated the list since the cars were first built.  So I have a $46,000 car that is really only a basic Pilot.  And there is nothing about it that is hands-free.  Honda was planning to add android auto in this model year and their clueless tech people couldn't figure out how to get lane departure to work with it so they kept Honda link (which they have had issues with if you check online complaints) instead.  I have a Samsung GS7 which is a top selling phone so it makes no sense that it would not be compatible",neg
"Buyer beware.  There is a major flaw with the transmission on the new CRV.  The dealer and Honda have said that they know it is there, but they have no idea how to fix it.  At a stop with foot on brake the car vibrates terribly.  It feels as if it will die on the spot.  And it is bad enough to rattle your bones.  Google Vibration in 2015 CRV to see how bad this is across the country! It does not instill confidence in the rest of the car.  Although Honda and the dealer sympathize, they are offering no help in getting it fixed.  When you buy a new car you expect it to be flawless.  I'm a long time Honda owner and am Super disappointed.   ",neg
"Brought my 2014 Jeep Cherokee Latitude last year.  Have had several recalls on it, but no real issues.  Today, of all days, Christmas Eve, went to the mall to finish Christmas shopping as I entered the mall going up a hill I hear the engine reving, struggling look down and see  SERVICE TRANSMISSION across the control panel.  Went to the Jeep Dealership and all I am told is, ""There is nothing we can do until Monday morning.""  So here I am stranded for Christmas.  TERRIFIC!",neg
"First off I love the Jeep Grand Cherokee brand. I had a 2003 and I decided to upgrade to a 2018. I was impressed by the upgrades, but that didn't last when about a week or two later I got an engine light on. Just before that the radio and navigation system shut down while driving without prompting. The SUV shut down after remote starting. Then the remote start app didn't always work. I tried to get assistance but there was no support. Then the jeep shut down after key remote start, sometimes it would not start with key remote start or it would shut down after getting in the vehicle. Driving back on a 20 miles trip the jeep smelled like it  was on fire to the point I stopped. After the 4th time taking it to the service department without a resolution I am trying to get my money back. I am so heart broken and disappointed in the brand.",neg
Was seriously considering a new 2016 CRV.  Went for a test drive and car had a obvious shudder or vibration around 35 to 40.   It also had the a slight vibration while stopped at intersection.    I would never buy a car that rode this poorly.   I was driving home wondering if I was being too critical and realized my 11 year old Toyota rides way better then the new Honda.,neg
"Great SUV, fantastic to drive, insulates you from the road and traffic noise. Just one concerning trait, heard this strange buzzing noise coming from underneath the rear end about 5 hours after it was turned off and parked in the garage. No idea what it was so Googled it; ""This is the sound of a fuel evaporation leakage check and, it does not indicate a malfunction"" was the answer in several searches. Sure enough it is in the Owner's manual as well. Would have been nice if the dealership would have pointed this out when they were explaining the other features at time of purchase.",pos
"I didn't care for the car because it felt like a toy and not a rugged vehicle as assumed, it seemed as if it was made of plastic and I felt every bump in the road.",neg
"I traded in my 17 Mazda 3 GT hatchback manual a few days ago for an 18 Honda Pilot EX-L with RES.  This is our 5th Honda(03 Pilot EX, 13 Honda Fit Sport, 13 Honda CRV EX-L, 17 CRV Touring).  I chose the EX-L trim because it was the closest match to my daily needs. I felt the ZF 9speed would drive me crazy with the auto shut off and all the nannies trying to assist me.  The 6 speed shifts smoothly and always is ready to drop a gear. Acceleration is plentiful, especially when merging onto the freeway.  The visibility is superb with low window sight lines and lots of glass.  The seating is awesome with plenty of room in the 3rd row.  The RES will get it use by my son and his friends on road trips.  The driving dynamics are pretty good but the steering is vague and the brakes don't give much feedback, but again this is a passenger hauler not a sports car.  I have had good experiences in the past with Honda's and this one should be the same. I perform all the maintenance on my vehicles and have never had any issues in the past 30 years.  Oil changes, filter changes, and tire rotations are about all I need to do with Honda vehicles.  The maintenance packages offered by our local Honda dealer are very expensive($3000+) and are essentially glorified oil changes.  If we decide to keep this more than 3 years, then I may buy a Honda Car extended warranty. Great job Honda!",pos
"This is the perfect for road trips! I drove this from Washington State to Southern California with no problems. The hight of the seats and windshield view is perfect. I drove through the snow, ice, dirt, and clean roads without issues. I recommend this to a new first time driver.",pos
"I know I should love this car and I know old ladies shouldn't swear.  But, I freaking hate this car and wish I had bought an older model, which is sad because I haven't bought a new car in 13 years!  1)Auto Stop - if you are stopped for a tiny amount of time, the engine will shut off and restart when you move the steering wheel or take your foot off the brake.  IT IS UNNERVING!!  When I bought the car, the dealer said you can turn that irritation off but he meant you have to turn it off every time you start the car.  2)The freaking BEEPING - you can turn the incessant beeping off and risk backing into a brick wall if you're not used to the camera, or you can leave it on and have it annoy the living @!#%& out of you - when you're backing out of an underground spot with nothing for 2-3' in any direction, when you're rounding a tight turn on your daily trip home (??????), or when it thinks you're too close to a car in front of you - I'm not yet dead, I'm not blind, if I'm that close to a car in front of me it's because I WANT TO BE!!  3)The incredibly stupid feature that unlocks all the windows - my boyfriend says it's unlocking the doors, then holding the unlock button down.  However, it happened to me when I LOCKED the car and not sure what got pressed as the key jostled in my purse.  In any case, who EVER wants all their windows opened unless they're IN THE CAR?  I live in Seattle - rain, rain and more rain, twice now in my car completely accidentally.  In summary of the features, TOO $%^&& MUCH! When I want a driverless car, I'll get one, til then LET ME DRIVE THE CAR!!!!!  And finally, I don't know if it's suspension or what, but going over  speed bumps or into a big profile driveway  (dozens of times a day for most people), is  detrimental to your spine.",neg
"Great drivers aids except blind spot monitoring should be on all models, not just the Elite. Apple CarPlay is great, no costly upgrades for onboard GPS.  Also captains chairs should be an option for all models, not just elite. I didn’t want to pay $8000 more for most items I don’t want or need like 2nd row entertainment, on board GPS etc. It has the space of an Odessey, but not the soccer mom look.",pos
"We had traded it in their 2012 Honda CRV for a 2015 Honda Pilot and we're traveling through life just fine for a year. Then one day stopping by the Honda dealership there it was the 2016 pilot. Before I knew it I was in talking to my salesman they gave me a fantastic deal on a trade in three and a half months later are 2016 Honda Pilot touring all wheel drive arrived. This vehicle is so much more than the 2015 pilot was. Smooth, quiet, very powerful, and all the options that one could will it. I must say the button shifting was something to get used to but now I'm very accustomed to it and wouldn't go back to a regular manual shifter. I can't say enough about the way the pilot Drives, handles, and once in awhile I must say I am guilty of disappointing kids and their little rocket cars as I ease into the gas pedal and deposit them in my rearview mirror. Handling is great visibility is good and I'm very happy with the vehicle. As we passed 38,200 miles the Pilot has taken us to Orlando and back as well as Mackinac Bridge, Chicago, Ohio, Detroit, and various points of interest, to include daily activities. All completed without a hitch. 30k service was a sticker shock with this fancy German ZF9 tranny accounting for $400.00 of the service bill. The Pilot is still wonderful to drive. Honda sent us a warranty extension on the ZF9 tranny extending it to ten years unlimited miles. We got a second letter requesting we bring the Pilot in for so the can replace the transmission fluid heater which has been failing causing motor and transmission failure. Yikes!!! I hope Honda's new ten speed and the standard ZF9 in all the new Odyssey vans have this shorted out. Love my Pilot, but I ordered a Ridgeline RTL-E in Obsidian blue three months ago. Rides even better than the Pilot, has the good old reliable six speed that only cost $100 to service as well as 18"" tires that are going 50k or more rather than my 20"" that were replaced at 31k! Just wish the Ridgeline made for the USA had all the Canadian Touring options. Despite the tranny the Pilot Touring AWD is far and away still my choice over the new Traverse and the much smaller Highlander. Our road trip to Florida was outstanding! Thanks Pilot!!! The Ridgeline will be a worthy replacement for our family of four.",pos
"7 adults can be seated comfortably, superior handling on freeways and village roads too, city 20/21 mpg, highway 26.1 mpg. Best inclass outward visibility, lots of storage space and cup holders, only downside Honda should offer navigation on the available 8"" touch screen.",pos
"I have long thought of the Forester as a rather frumpy-looking car with inferior interior materials and ergonomics (my basis for comparison is my beloved 2005 Outback 2.5 XT Limited with a manual transmission). But my 2017 2.0 XT Touring edition of the Forester (with EyeSight) blows away those perceptions. While the exterior design is more purposeful than elegant, I do not find it objectionable, and the interior is a pleasant, rewarding place to pass the miles. In fact, I opted for the Forester over the Outback 3.6R Touring because I prefer the Forester's interior design and ergonomics as well as its performance and handling, which are more responsive and lively (the Outback is nice, but it's comparatively sedate). I find the build quality of the Forester to be excellent and its aesthetics appropriate to its go-anywhere character. Ingress and egress are excellent and outward visibility is superb, in contrast to competitive vehicles that have huge blind spots in the rear quarters. The Harmon Kardon audio system is very pleasing, and EyeSight does what it's designed to do, very well. The front seats are comfortable, but I wish they had a little more lateral support (because the Forester handles so well) and I wish the passenger seat provided adjustability (preferably powered) of height and lumbar support -- significant shortcomings in a vehicle of such overall quality. Also, the tailgate opens and closes rather slowly automatically, but it's quick and easy to do so manually, which I usually do. I initially had serious reservations about going to a CVT, and those reservations were confirmed when test-driving competitive vehicles, but Subaru has implemented this technology extremely well, and I'm very happy with it, in conjunction with SI-Drive. I highly recommend this vehicle for anyone who values function and usability over style, and people of all ages (I'm a ""senior"") who lead active lifestyles and appreciate a vehicle that's versatile, fun to drive, well built and safe. Yes, the price of this vehicle (loaded, with an extended warranty) approaches $40K, which might strike you as a lot to pay for a Forester, but forget your impressions of previous models; a lot of improvements were made for 2017 (sound deadening, torque vectoring, front-fascia design, steerable LED headlights, interior materials and appointments, etc.), and I consider the 2.0 XT Touring edition of the Forester to be a good value in comparison to competitive offerings. Note that I am still quite new to this car, but after some 1,500 miles, I am so enthusiastic about it that I couldn't wait to post a review. I plan to update this review at a later date if anything changes, although I believe these comments are pretty solid.

UPDATE: I now have over 17,000 miles on my Forester and can confirm that the above comments remain accurate. At the same time, I would like to add a few details that might be useful to potential buyers.  I live in the ""flatlands,"" but last year took a 3,600-mile road trip to Colorado, where Subarus seem to be the ""state car,"" since there are so many of them there -- and for good reason. The Forester handled mountain highways and rocky, steep, muddy, unpaved back roads with aplomb. It's no Jeep, so it's wise to take the rough spots gingerly, but the high ground clearance, X-Drive, S# (Sport sharp) mode, short hood (for good visibility), tight turning circle, and generous approach and departure angles worked beautifully and inspired confidence. With 8 (simulated) gear ratios in S# mode, the CVT provides fine control of engine braking going downhill, and is easily adjusted with the paddles (usually with the transmission in Manual mode). While I find S# mode a little fussy in flat country, I've come to be a great fan of it under more demanding driving conditions. While every previous car I've owned had a manual transmission, and it took me a while to adjust to the CVT, I can say now that I've become a great fan of Subaru's implementation of this technology. I've read some criticisms of it, but I have not had any of those concerns with the high-torque version of the CVT that is paired with the 2.0 XT engine. I also found that the 2.0 XT engine, with its twin-scroll turbo and direct injection, has plenty of power for high-altitude (i.e., thin-air) mountain driving. In short, of all the competitive vehicles I've tested, I consider the Touring edition of the Forester 2.0 XT to be the best blend of ""sport"" and ""utility."" It may not have the sexiest exterior styling (it hasn't completely shed its frumpiness), but I find it tasteful enough; its build quality, affordability, performance, handling, ergonomics and versatility carry the day.  I keep looking for excuses to get in and drive it. I wouldn't recommend tackling the Rubicon Trail with a Forester, but this is one great car for anyone who has an active lifestyle and enjoys exploring out-of-the-way places.",pos
"Shiny, sculptured wheel covers are PLASTIC.  Installed in a manner that makes them easily damaged in minor curb encounter.  Cannot be repaired.  Cannot be bought alone as replacement.  Must buy $650 wheel and cover combo.  Unacceptable for a $40,000 car.

Wheel covers less important as time passes.  I dont know if 2017-18 uses different wheels?  Only one minor scrape since major wheel cover scrape in first year.

Navigation system voice recognition is still unreliable after a Toyota software upgrade about a year ago.  You can say 'black' and it recognizes 'white'.  Siri on my iPhone is super reliable.  Why cant Toyota do the same.  Voice recognition on my 2016 Ford F-150 is great.

Best thing about Toyota is longevity and reliability.  Much better resale value in later years.  Very seldom is there ever a reason to even visit the dealer.",pos

I took to a. Different dealer to check out three times. The touch screen radio also locks up.  Tech said radio, breaks and gas to engine are all controlled by computer. It is thought to be throttle body censor and computer.

It checks all of my boxes, main thing is the ability to carry up to 8 in comfort (including the rear seats). The ride and road manners are great seems much more spacious than the 2009 and the fuel economy is aces. We average around 30 MPG on the road per the trip computer.  A++++++++",pos
"DO NOT BUY THIS CAR until you research ""2015 CRV vibration problem"". When you are in drive and stopped in traffic or at a stoplight, the seats vibrate so badly it is disturbing. Honda is aware of this but has done nothing to fix it. If you still want one, make sure you test drive it until it warms up. The rpms idle too low, thus the vibration. Dealers won't tell you about this. """,neg
"My new 2018 Subaru Forester  is just fantastic.  This is the third Forester that I've owned and they keep getting better all the time.  Bought it for the safety features, especially Eyesight.  Fuel mileage is tops, too!  Considered the turbo, but it requires high test gas and yields lower mileage, so stayed with the old reliable standard 2.5 engine.  Always enjoyed the CVT and the dash displays encourage the driver to drive softly so as to minimize engine rpms and maximize fuel economy.  Lots of room for my stuff.  Best handling of all the Foresters I've had.  Great lighting, especially for aging eyes!  Very satisfied with my new Subaru Forester.  Dealer (Apple of York, PA) experience was great--no pressure, very helpful and responsive sales staff.",pos
We have only had our forester for a month and we already have 1500 miles on it. We have driven Hondas and toyotas and feel you can't beat them but loved the features of the forester. So far we are very impressed with the quality of our new Subaru and with Byers Subaru dealership. The salesperson told us to bring our car in as much as we wanted for a car wash. I was pleasantly surprised when they even sprayed off the all weather mats and swept the interior!,pos
"I have owned nothing but Jeep Grand Cherokees for the past 20 years, having had at least 5 in that time. The new transmission and gear shifter, introduced for the 2014 model is just awful. Transmission is sluggish and slow to respond. Feels sometimes like when you are driving with someone in a manual transmission car and they dont know how to shift. The new gear shifter is complicated, and its hard to know what gear you are in, or get the car into the gear you want. I have thought I was in park and actually was in reverse. I cant bee live they ruined this car. The transmission was awesome, the gear shifter was fine, and they just ruined them. I will be selling my new 2014 with 3500 miles on it as soon as I can. I have noted many used 2014's available on dealer websites, so obviously I am not alone. This vehicle is a dud.",neg

"Purchasing this car was the biggest mistake I've ever made!  Buyer beware - read the reviews/complaints before spending all this money on a vehicle that has so much hesitation on acceleration that I'm pretty sure I'm going to get killed.  A vehicle is suppose to move forward when pressing on the gas peddle. Instead the engine rev's really loud like I'm in a plane taking off but your still not going anywhere.  In the meantime, the window of opportunity to pull out is quickly decreasing because of oncoming traffic (to the point where I would no longer feel safe in doing so) Then the car finally reacts and lurches forward throwing everyone back in their seats.  To oncoming traffic and passengers in my car, it looks like I'm pulling out at the last minute and cutting them off.  This happens during All accelerations, back streets and highway driving.  I brought it back to the dealer and took the service manager for a drive and his response was that's normal! He confirmed that it drives this way but to say it's NORMAL is unacceptable. I have a 2015 Grand Cherokee Overland and will trade it as soon as possible!",neg
I purchased a 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee Overland Eco-Diesel about a year ago and have been in and out of the shop once a moth over this last year getting the CEL reset and parts replaced and DEF fluids drained and refilled half way.

"I think this is a great smaller SUV. Plenty of room in the cargo area for various activities. I have enough room for groceries, packing up for long camping trips and even moving wood and materials for home projects. Seats and ride are extremely comfortable even with the sport tuned suspension. Great power and I love the option for S#/S/I modes. It'd be nice to have a digital speed readout like on my husbands WRX but you can read the speedometer just fine. The steering is responsive and hugs the road well around corners. I wish it had a higher tow rating but 1500lbs is enough to tow a trailer with a atv and few dirt bikes so it fits my needs. I'm happy with the gas mileage. I really enjoy the upgraded infotainment system, Bluetooth connection is great and the touch screen is really responsive. I love the look of this vehicle, it's aggressive looking with a very comfortable ride. I actually got my mother in law to buy one as well. I would recommend the forester to anyone looking for a smaller SUV with a good amount of power, comfortable ride and reliability and reputation of Subaru.",pos
"First during this first year the transmission went out. Since it was under warranty it was fixed. Then the air conditioning compressor stopped working and I also couldnt start the truck.

"I have had my 2014 Forester 2.5i premium trim for about 3 months now and am really disappointed in the ride of this new model. i turned in a 2010 Forester, same model and trim, then leased this new model. I was so looking forward to this new design that changed the side view mirrors and front windshield design, That had been my only complaint in the 2010 model. The mirror placement created a huge blind spot , especially when turning left. I saw the 2014 at the Detroit International Auto Show and was trilled to see the change in mirror design. I couldn't wait to lease this new car! I was expecting my 2010 with the mirror fix. Boy was I shocked when I drove it home.(MY big mistake was not test driving the car I leased, it came from out of state. Lesson Learned for you readers, Drive the car you think you want BEFORE signing any papers.) The ride is terrible. The car ""bounces"" my word, the auto word I guess is ""firm"" over, any kind of road imperfection, not just the obvious pot holes. It is very uncomfortable and annoying to have your body and car constantly shaking or quivering. Subaru tells me it's the redesign of the suspension that makes for a more firm ride. If you like a comfortable ride for city driving this is NOT the car for you!! I have always relied on the quality and safety of a Subaru, but time will tell if this model lives up to those standards.",neg
"We especially like the new 6 speed transmission. It allows use of cruise control, even on hills without revving up the engine as much as earlier models. The seats are more comfortable than earlier models. Gas mileage is similar to earlier models, ie 22-25 MPG on the interstate. It also provides the solid quiet ride we expect from a Highlander. We miss the power passenger seat on our XLE model. We liked the LE model but needed 8 passenger capacity not available on the LE model. We replaced a 2008 Highlander with over 200,000 miles for this vehicle. We had no problems with it and expect the same quality and reliability with our new one. I'm sold on the new one.",pos

"It's a pretty great car if you're realistic. I traded my wife my C250 Mercedes for the new Forester XT (FXT), at first several things felt very cheap compared to the Benzo. After spending three months and 6k mi in it, I realized why the engineers did what they did and why this is a popular selling car. The car is comfortable and has great visibility, the Premium trim has everything you NEED plus some extras (i.e. pano roof and seat heaters). The turbo engine pulls strongly and the CVT transmission is not as obtrusive as many car enthusiasts say it is, I believe Subaru has very well executed their Lineartronic transmission for this application. The interior isn't as luxurious as a Benz but frankly, it shouldn't be... it's a practical car. If you're realistic on what you want your Subaru to do and why you're buying it, it is pretty ideal. I wanted something to go off road on the weekends and commute to work during the week. The FXT serves its purpose well providing a very large back seat and great cargo room in the back. The turbo requires synthetic oil and premium fuel (as do most other modern turbocharged, direct injected engines) and there hasn't been any oil consumption or other engine issue to note. When cold starting, the engine shimmies just barely, but this is normal so ignore other peoples claims of a rough idle, they're seriously over exaggerating it. The Subaru Starlink system is nice but pretty gimmicky, I do like the remote locking and tracking features but frankly could have done without.  What I absolutely love about the vehicle is the go anywhere prowess.... I live in dry, Southern California where I go hunting for snow and dirt trails. I've taken the FXT off roading in moderate and medium trails and have been very impressed with the capabilities with it's AWD system (by the looks of the 4Runner and Jeep owners, they were too). I will say that on a moderate or medium trail, you're really pushing the car to it's limits... in retrospect I don't know what I was thinking. Either way, it's a great car and highly recommended.

Update... I've got almost 25,000 miles on it in just over a year and a half. Still zero oil consumption, zero problems and 24.5 lifetime mpg. That figure comes from a lot of commuting and long highway miles. I'm pleased with almost every aspect of the vehicle, here's where i'm still left wanting:
     -OEM tires are truly awful. Terrible wear, terribly feeling, loud and awful grip. I've never had a terrible Bridgestone product but i'm so disenfranchised that i'll be going to Michelin shortly. 
      - The only replacement tires are passenger car tires unless you special order or take really subpar off road tires. Unfortunately you're caught between a rock and a hard place.. pun intended.",pos

"It was time for a replacement for my Jetta TDI. Living in New England it is four wheel drive or walk home. I am a retired businessman living on a fixed income so getting the best value is important. I narrowed the search to a Kia Sorento and the Forester. Both were impressive on the test drives with the Forester edging out the win by being tighter and quieter. The layout of the cockpit was better in the Forester and I was able locate and understand marginally better. Once I began driving I became more impressed with all of the aspects of the Forester. It does things for me like; reminding me to stay in my lane, put my brakes on to slow properly, eyes in the back of my head with the camera. It is not going to win a drag race but I can merge into traffic with no problem. Bottom line is, It feels solid and drives the miles in an honest and straightforward way. I am actually looking forward to snow season this year.",pos
The first forester I purchased was totaled in the first month of ownership and it saved my life.  The second and third one are leases and I have never had a single problem.  It is safe and reliable!,pos
"Needed an AWD on our hill for the winter, but also needed space for our camping, hiking & biking trips. Lost some space when we sold our minivan for this, but still has plenty of storage. Wish the console was a little bigger-it is deep. Also the console which serves as the elbow rest is short, so really unusuable as an elbow rest if the seat is forward.  Very easy to fold down the seats & love the sun/moon roof. Great turning radius  but haven't driven it off road yet. Plenty of pickup. Auto climate control is a little tricky to figure out. But overall, felt it is a much better buy & better visibility than a Santa Fe Hyundai, Ford escape, Honda, or chevy equinox. Nissan rogue & even the subaru outback.",pos
"I bought my Trailhawk with 12 miles on it. It is now around 4,000 miles and I am experiencing issues. When I turn the car on, it says that 4WD is unavailable and that power steering needs to be serviced. I took it to the dealer and they ""fixed"" it. Sure enough, two days after the service was completed (reset PCM), the same warning came on.",neg
"To update my review, the vibration problem is still there. The dealer updated what they called a software problem which had no effect that I could tell. They rotated and balanced the tires which did not solve the problem, it still vibrated. I returned to the dealer and they had a mechanic ride with me who told me it was the Dunlap tires and I should buy Michelin tires when these wear out. I have since had the tires balanced again with no improvement. So I'm not spending anymore money, it's just going to have to vibrate. I plan to get rid of it soon and Honda will not be my next car. If they can't put tires on their car that will balance and ride smooth I'm done.
I have two main problems with this car. The first is the vibration when at idle and at highway speeds. The vibration at 65 -70 mph is felt both in the driver and passenger areas and Honda has no solution for it. The dealer tried new software but did not correct the problem and said Hoda is working on more upgrades. In the meantime we have to drive a car that's shaking like crazy. The second is the hesitation at low speeds which I understand is caused by the transmission. When trying to accelerate through a intersection the car just hesitates then finally will start to accelerate. This is a safety problem. Dealer says that's the way the transmission is. I thought I was buying a car that would last a long time but now I'm stuck with this thing with no solution in site. DONT BUY ONE.

Miller Honda has balanced and rotated the tires but it is still vibrating. The service manager is going for a ride with me this week and is anxious to solve my problems with this car. I look forward to this being fixed
The hesitation at an intersection was caused by me having my foot still on the brake, driving with two feet.",neg
"I spent the better part of a year researching SUV's as I'm also the owner of a 2004 Tacoma TRD Off-Road.  Having spent 13 years in that truck, I was getting a little tired of the stiff ride and poor gas mileage, but I need something that can handle some off-road as well as poor driving conditions in the winter.  I was thinking of trading my truck for either a new Tacoma or a 4Runner, but really didn't feel like I'd get anything very different, especially from an MPG standpoint.  Enter the Forester.  My biggest concern was the available ""get up and go"" since I live at about 6100 ft in Colorado and frequently drive into the mountains where 10,000+ ft is common.  The XT was an obvious consideration but the MPG of the Limited 2.5i was very enticing.  After test driving the 2.5i up the local pass, I decided it would suffice.  I've got 2000 miles on the car and many of them are mountain driving.  No power issues whatsoever!  I'll admit I'm not racer, but I usually go about 5mph over the speed limit and have really had no problem with acceleration or keeping the speed up at all with the 2.5i.  If I could have gotten blind spot and RCTA on the XT without going all the way to a Touring model, I'd have probably gone that route (although I much prefer regular gas to premium).  Anyway, the Limited 2.5i has a very comfortable ride and I'm averaging about 28mpg in town and 35mpg on the interstate...again, at real altitude!  Also, I got to keep my truck!  I couldn't be happier with my decision.",pos
"Pros: Rock solid look, feel and handling. Calm-instilling, smooth, quiet ride. Sensible, simple, intuitive controls. Luxury car look, feel and performance at a below-luxury price and with lower cost regular fuel! Safe, effective all wheel drive and active safety systems.  Cons: Smaller than ideal cargo space.  Very tight third row -- for young children or emergency, short trips only. Lane departure sensor is a little too sensitive. Navigation slightly less intuitive and useful than other controls and systems in this vehicle and than navigation systems in other vehicles and after-market or cell phone based systems.  Overall: An easy 5 out of 5 stars!  This vehicle should be on anyone's list for a mid-size SUV with a third row seat.  There is a wide variety of option levels with corresponding wide variety in cost so it can fit into many budgets whether you choose the top end to compete with luxury vehicles as we ultimately did or a ""lower"" level which can compete with almost any but the smallest, compact SUVs on price (which we also considered).",pos
"Not much has changed in my overall opinion over that past 5000 miles.  Still a hoot to drive, lots of pull with the turbo engine.  I installed an aftermarket tow hitch to carry my mountain bike, still have plenty of ground clearance.  Gas mileage has been fine at around 22mpg, with mostly city driving.  Have seen over 30mpg on slower highways(65mph).
Will be installing snow tires next winter, had it up in the mountains in some pretty deep snow and slick roads, it made it up no problem with the OEM tires, but I do like the extra grip of snow tires on slick roads.

"This is a great Crossover with few compromises. We cross shopped the typical competitors; Honda, Mazda, Hyundai, GM, etc. Given we have/had a Mazda CX-5 and 6, thought it was natural we would end up in the CX-9. The CX-9 had too many compromises in practicality and options that didn't over come the driving fun part - this is a family commuter. The fact that Toyota Safety Sense is included is a real bonus. The lane  departure and radar cruise control are features you never knew you  needed before. There are more goodies that add up in terms of practicality and comfort. Items like 2nd row shades, heated front seats, heated mirrors, large 8""UI screen, 5 USB outlets, tri-climate control, leather seating in front rows, full function moon roof, a intercom system, solid V6 / 8spd auto, auto start/stop (could do without), ample small storage-notably the mid-shelf in the dash, navigation, power liftgate, reclining seats in the 2nd and 3rd row too, and a window hatch that opens independent of the rear gate! For us the Captains / bucket seats in the 2nd row was a must because of having supervision for multiple car seat riders that can be tended to without crazy gymanastics. All the above without having to step up to the top expensive trims; like in other brands. The higher trims on the Highlander have nice options but not worth the money for our lifestyle. Worth test driving the competition but currently there is no comparison in our minds in terms of the options, safety, reliability, and over all package performance. Keep the factory add on's to a minimum and you can get a good out the door price; keeping in mind you are in the market for a 3 row cross over. Online price comparisons don't always talk about the dealer fees and sales tax but it adds up.

"I have spent nearly 100 hours over the past several months reading/watching everything I can about midsize suv's and trucks.    I test drove a number as well. 

I had shyed away from Subaru mostly because I was never a fan of their appearance which is why it took me so long to start researching them and eventually test driving.  

I was blown away at how much you get for the price.  The quality is obvious the minute you see one in person and take it for a drive.  The standard AWD is unbeatable.   

It feels heavy yet has this velvety smooth acceleration that makes you feel one with the pavement.  

The outward appearance is deceiving.  It doesn't look huge but when you step inside its like an entirely different vehicle.  It's extremely roomy inside and the oversized windows open it up even more.    

I test drove a RAV4 with comparable features and it felt like a large Corolla and was way pricier.

"I do not own this car but I did take it for a test drive and when I saw all the issues of the vibration I decided to look further into it. The dealership told me not to let the ""fake reviews on-line sway me because they are written by other competing dealerships"" FALSE! There are true issues and I called Honda corporate to find out there are and this is copied and pasted from their website:

When driving my 2015 CR-V, I sometimes experience a vibration primarily felt through the driver's seat, either at idle while in gear or while driving at engine speeds below 2,200 RPM. Is this normal?
The 2015 CR-V now includes a Direct-Injection Earth Dreams engine and a Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT). With the combination, Honda was able to enhance fuel efficiency and increase engine torque. With these changes, some customers have reported experiencing a vibration that they primarily feel through the vehicles driver seat. Customers who experience the vibration have reported it may happen intermittently, either while stopped with the vehicle in gear or while driving at engine speeds below 2,200 RPM. Honda wants to assure our owners that we have heard your concerns and are analyzing available data and customer comments, and performing actual vehicle testing.
Please click here for a descriptive video.

I don't think I'm interested and they said nothing has been done for these owners, other than documenting their VIN's and they will look into it. Also, from my own observations the cloth fabric on the front seats are not tucked under and the edges all show which is unsightly. The dealerships don't want to address or hear about these complaints and want to move on to the next customer.",neg
"Yes, the SUV vibrates..As the driver, you don't notice too much.  But literally 7 out of 7 passengers have said they feel dizzy or a bit sick whenever they are in it.  The interior quality is like a Chevy, and that's not a compliment.  Hard touch plastic everywhere.  Yes, I bought the LX, the base, but I recently traded this for an Ouback, and the Outback is on another level of quality.  Before the Outback, I drove the Touring, the top CRV made, it's literally the same quality on the panel, dash, door...Even with leather seats, the rest of the interior is cheap...I'm sure the transmission and engine will last 200,000 miles, but the engine does not work with the car, thus the vibration.  And the interior is closer to a toy than a real car.  I have owned 11 new Honda's, there will never be a 12th.  My last civic was also pretty cheap feeling.  I drive 50% on highway, 50% in town, and never got better than 21.6 mpg.  The other day was the first day in Oregon we had frost on the window.  I turned on the car to warm it up, waited 2, 2.5 minutes for it to warmup a bit, and turned on the defrost, 100% on high...It took 11 additional minutes before I could barely see out of the bottom of the windshield...At 14 minutes, with the help of wipers I could see safely enough to drive.",neg
"I purchased the 2016 EX-L w/Navi in August 2015 after seeing the new body style. I really disliked the square bread box look of the 2015 Pilot and I am very pleased with the look of the 2016 Pilot. I needed the additional seats for 4 grandchildren we spend time with very often. I have been a VOLVO owner for the last 20 years so this was a big change for me. My last VOLVO was a XC90 and I must say I am very pleased with my change to the Honda Pilot. The interior finish, comfortable leg room seating for tall passengers, and the gas mileage are appreciated. It has proved to be a great choice and change for me. There are a couple of things that would be great additions: Adding Lane Watch and defrost to both side view mirrors, adding fold-in side view mirrors, diminish the sewing machine sound the engine makes if you are sitting idle, Improve IMMEDIATE GET UP AND GO acceleration in 1st gear, voice command needs work, volume control is very frustrating.

"Hello. I wanted to let you know that I am very disappointed in the Jeep Cherokee that I purchased less than one year ago. 

You see, the ""Jeep"" name has always had a special place in my heart, and this purchase was not only my first brand new car 

purchase, but also my first Jeep vehicle purchase. It was a very special experience and time for me, but I want to tell you 

that the 2015 Jeep Cherokee is the biggest disappointment ever, and here are the reasons why:

1. It was terrible in the snow last year. I purchased this the day after Thanksgiving (2014), and the car handled very 

poorly in the snow months of December - February. There was a time when I could not even drive the car up a hill that had 

not been plowed. Compared to my 2003 Honda Element, which was the car that this Jeep replaced, the snow handling is an epic 

fail.

2. The Heated Seats Options will either burn your butt off or you vaguely feel the heated seats.

3. The temperature controls are terrible. Again, you're either roasting in the car or you're freezing cold, but there is no happy medium.

4. The bluetooth option to my iPhone 6 Plus is intermitten. Sometimes it works instantly, sometimes, it will not sync up whatsoever, and is extremely tempermental.

5. Right after purchasing the car, less than 3,000 miles, there must have been something wrong with the transmission because each time I would shift the transmission to back up out of a parking space then switch to drive, it would ""jolt"" the car as if it you were being shaken. We brought the car back to have the transmission reprogrammed, and that issue isn't as big anymore.

6. The transmission when accelerating is very poor. Again, my Honda Element as a 4-cylinder engine, so I thought this Jeep's 4-cylinder engine would be okay/perform the same, but it doesn't. When I accelerate, there is a 20 second delay before the car will actually accelerate.

7. After it has rained outside and there is water on the car, don't even attempt to open your windows because water WILL come into your car. My Honda Element did not have the window protectors, but when the car was wet and I would make turns in the vehicle, water would not come into my car.  This Jeep has water running in.

All in all, I am very disappointed and unhappy with this car. If I could afford another car, I would get another one, and I no longer have such a ""love"" for the Jeep brand anymore after this experience.",neg
"We bought a 2015 and for the most part my husband and I really like it. It handles great and is easy to park. The interior is very nice looking and I like the shelf for cell phones and iPods. The issue we have is that while the driver's seat is very comfortable because it has so many adjustments the front passenger seat bothers both of our backs on long drives. It is fine for short trips. My husband is just under 6' and I am 5'5"". Even if we would have purchased the 4 way power passenger seat it still wouldn't support the lower back. My advice is if you make frequent trips over a couple hours long and your the passenger, you may want to look elsewhere for your next vehicle.",pos
Honda has it wrong with the way they market... lots of options on EXL but most cars on the lot only come with one.,pos
"So far a great car, believe it's comparable to a Lexus.",pos
"They have placed the air intake at the bottom of the motor. I purchased for reliability in all weather, was assured this is it. 
Around the block from my house wave of water came rushing down hill, sucked water up and seized up the motor. This is a design issue that they will ""fix"" with a snorkle kit. Too late. Should have told me. 
My 92 Mazda and 06 Nissan have dealt with deeper water than this. Very dissappointed. I will assume it is an ""extra accessory"" but was never suggested.",neg
"I've had this vehicle for 26 months & 13000 miles of mixed driving. It's been getting 22.5 mpg, & I've been babying it w/eco mode on. If you drive it ""normally"", it drops to 22 in eco mode, & 21 w/o eco mode.

Unless you have super quick reflexes to hit the eco button to disable eco mode in an emergency, leave it off or the car has virtually no pickup.
 
The interior of the doors is all cheap plastic, and there's very little in the way of support behind the door panels. I tend to lean my left leg against the door when I drive, and it's already starting to ""give"".

The door panels rattle and the dealer says it's ""normal"". Really?

The console box is small compared to my Camry & the USB/HDMI connections are in there; if you keep stuff wired up, there isn't much usable storage in there. 

Little pickup but handles well.

The tech package isn't ready for prime time. Lane departure warning gives more false alarms than legit and I keep it off. Lane keep assist (self steering) works ok on a clean road with freshly painted lines, but any little thing makes it lose sight of the road and it constantly warns you to take over full control. More of a distraction once you get past the novelty of it.

Pass on the tech package: $5000 and it is not Tesla's or Google's self driving car, not even close

Update: Jan 7, 2017: It's been a while and the review stands as-written. I leave the eco-mode off full time as I've had a few occasions to need to accelerate rapidly and there is simply no time to find that eco button. The lane-departure-warning is wrong more than it's right. The lane-keep-assist requires you to spend more time looking at the dash than the road since it's constantly giving the the can't-see-the-lines-on-the-road-please-take-over warning. Also, the mileage is not even remotely close to what Honda advertised.

Update: Jan 10, 2017: One final thought to consider when purchasing this - or any other - vehicle. Most of my trips are short (less than 10 miles). I just got back from a two day 900 mile trip and discovered something else. The front seats have what I'll call ""wings"" that are sculpted up and inward on the base, and seat back - presumably to provide support, or help keep you in place during an accident. I'm a pretty big guy and on any long trip they tend to put a lot of pressure on your thighs and back. I assumed it was because of my size. My brother, who is as skinny as can be, bought a Lexus with the same style seats. He has a 95 mile daily drive and within 2 weeks he traded in the car because the seats made him uncomfortable. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but you'll only know if it works for you personally if you think about it *consciously* while sitting in the vehicle. It's not something you'll notice on a test drive, but something that you should consider when purchasing ANY vehicle.",neg

"There ought to be a class action suit against Chrysler for putting a transmission on the market not fully de-bugged. Jeep service people say the tranny has to ""learn"" how you drive to settle down; it's had 6500 miles to do that and it's still as ""clunky"", ""jerky"" and uncomfortable and scary to drive as ever. Scary because of the lack of any smoothness between gears and the fear that the drive train will break as soon as the warranty expires. This is one of the worst car investments I've made and just don't have the time or inclination to file the lemon law process. Fortunately, this is a company lease which is unfortunate as I've exposed my company to costs down the road that reflect on me. Lousy car experience and Chrysler employees have been less than helpful. At one point they offered to buy back the car then had a change of heart when they claimed the transmission, bad as it was, was not categorized as a manufacturer's defect. If it isn't defective what is it??",neg
"As an owner of a 2015 Subaru Forester Touring model, I will NOT recommend Subaru to anyone as long as they do NOT support their interior safety and electronics.

"We purchased our 2017 Jeep Cherokee about 4 months ago now and are very happy with our Jeep. The Cherokee rides well, the suspension does a great job of absorbing large bumps, the leather seats on our North addition are very comfortable, the interior is very roomy, we love everything about our Cherokee. I am pleasantly surprised with the power of the 4 cylinder engine, dont get me wrong it is not going to win any races, but the 4 cylinder engine in combination with the 9 speed automatic transmission does a good job overall, the 9 speed automatic transmission does good job of selecting the proper gear for the acceleration and road speed,it keeps the engine speed low to save fuel when its possible and appropriate. I was reluctant to buy the 4 cylinder engine at 1st, but since I was not crazy about the idea that the 6 cylinder engine has the start stop feature, shutting the engine at every stop and restarting again, I keep my cars a long time, the car I traded in on the Jeep, I purchased new and was 23 years old when we traded it in and I think the start stop feature of the 6 cylinder version might be trouble down the line? So I opted for the 4 cylinder engine, since the Cherokee 4 cylinder engine does NOT have the start stop feature and could not be happier with the 4 cylinder Cherokee. I m very happy that the Jeep Cherokee was built in Ohio, with a high U.S. parts content, that is a big plus in my book. Thank you Chrysler for making such a great small SUV, me and my wife could not be happier with our Jeep Cherokee, North edition, 4X4.",pos

We drove at least four more Cherokees and all had the rough idle, some worse than ours. It is so bad that we traded back at a substantial loss just to get out of it.

I was told by dealer mechanic I should have not just stopped by, but should have called to make an appt.   I had the car 5 days!!! Car just didn't feel right. Told there was no problem. Then the following week, 5 or 6 days later the check engine light came on & I called for appt. Told me bring it right down. Told there is a problem with O2 sensor software & Subaru has no fix for it yet...that they're working on it. I could feel a lack of power when that engine light came on, but am told that the car is ok & that I should bring it back to have the engine light reset if it comes back on again & that they'll call me when Subaru has a software fix. Brakes still make noise & the engine still feels like it gets a slight ""buck"" or ""bounce"" in it. I feel I was sold a product by Subaru when they knew there was a problem with it. Mechanic told me they had another 2017 Forester will the O2 sensor issue as well. I told them I wanted Subaru to take this car back.  I was told the dealer manager would call me & he never did. I'm afraid to take this car any long distance. I bought it brand new based on reliability reviews. I bought a new car because I didn't want problems with a used one.

"We just purchased our Forester so we can't rate the reliability and the repair costs, etc. However, the amount of room in the SUV is fantastic; great headroom, great leg room, plenty of cargo space, and even a full size spare tire!  It seems to be a great value.  We are experiencing some difficulty in understanding the directions for customizing the lists for radio stations etc.  The manual seems a little difficult to understand but we may just need more time to ""play"" with the settings etc. All in all we are quite excited about our purchase and pleased with our experience at International Subaru of Merrillville.",pos
Very noisy inside and out( engine too). Too expensive on maintenance every time you go to service have to pay for something extra. The interior is easy to get dirty and hard to clean. Should get a CRV or A Rav4 never again a forester. After we paid it up we’ll trade it its not worth keeping it,neg
It has a very solid feel and is quiet when compared to other SUVs I have had. I haven’t had it long enough to attest to it’s reliability,pos
"This is a very good car.  Easy to drive, comfortable, roomy, and feels solid and well made. Mileage has been 29mpg combined road, mountain, and town driving. The CVT responds quickly and works very well (the engine is a little too peaky for a manual). The car turns in and transitions well on curvy mountain roads. It is actually fun to drive being taunt and predictable. Long highway trips are no problem, and neither are washed out, muddy, and rutted farm and mountain roads with the high ground clearance and real 4wd. I would buy a Forester again in a heartbeat as it has been a better all around car than I thought possible, certainly in its price range. 
It has been over a year and 30,000 miles since I wrote the above and I would not change a thing in my review. I have owned a lot of different cars in my life, but have never been loyal to a brand. My Forester may change that. It has done everything I have asked it to do, and done it well.  This is a very good car.

I have owned the car a little more than two years now, but it was totaled last week when a deer ran in front of me at night. No hitting the brake, no chance to do anything, as fast as you can say [non-permissible content removed], it was over with.  Hit it at a full 60mph. I was uninjured and no passengers were with me. Damage to the car was itself was relatively minor, but all the air bags deployed, which totaled it out. The air bags and the safety systems worked like they were supposed to, but let me tell you, it was as traumatic as hitting the deer! After it happened, it took about 20 seconds for me to regain my orientation and figure out that I was at a stop in the road. Luckily, no car was around to hit me, because I could not see out of the car well enough to get it to the side of the road (still running). All the interior lights had come on and with the smoke from the air bags, I could not see beyond the wind shield.  The  disagreeable odor discharged by the air bags was also distracting. The seat belt had pulled me  tightly into the seat so I was not hit with the steering wheel bag when it went off, but the bag under the steering wheel smacked my shins pretty good. The side air bags, running the length of the car, were the last to deflate and hung down so far that I could not see out of the sides of the car anyway. I guess the point of all this is just to say that air bags going off are no small thing, but, boy, I am GLAD they are there.
This Forester has been so satisfactory, I am going to get another one.

"I bought my 2015 CRV last year and immediately had difficulty with the vehicle shuddering and then stalling.  Now a year later, the transmission has been replaced, but the experience has been horrible.  I had to call Honda corporate and have a case manager because the repairs, even though they were all under warranty, took more than a week to get approved before they could even order parts or begin repairing it.   I was without my car for all of that time, and they wouldn't approve a rental because they said the car was drivable. ( I did finally get a rental, but only for the last 2 of 10 days) If the car needs a new transmission, how it that considered drivable and safe?   10 days later I had my CRV back, and I immediately took it to another dealer and traded it in.  I have lost confidence in Honda products and in their service department.  I have always owned Hondas, but never again.",neg

But, we love Subaru for its functionality and peace of mind it give us knowing that the car will take care of us through our journey - pavement jungle or the real jungle.  This is our 5th Subaru and it won't be the last one for certainty.  Although, the Forester is a great vehicle,  when we make a long distance trip,  we preferred the more comfortable Outback our 4th Subaru (it feels heavier,  more planted and better fuel mpg).  It would be great if the diesel engine option was available since it gives better fuel economy and torque for a bit more towing capacity.

"I have owned Honda's all my life. This is my 5th Honda, and it will be my last. Words cannot describe how frustrated and disappointed I am with this vehicle. I test drove the lower level version and thought it was great, but it was a huge mistake to upgrade to the Touring. That infotainment system is a joke. I've almost gotten in accidents just trying to use it. Attempting to control the music/volume is a nightmare. Oh, and when we're using maps the passenger has absolutely no control over the music. The 9-speed transmission is terrible. I feel like my neck hurts after driving because all of the jerking around. I am constantly fighting with this car to be in control. God forbid I have to do something quickly, like get around a stopped car with traffic coming, because the car doesn't react quickly to my foot. I despise this car, and we have it for sale, though no doubt will lose a ton of money on it. I'm so glad we're not the only ones having issues. We have registered the complaint with Honda Motor, and have brought it back to dealership a few times, but they are mostly dismissive of our concerns.",neg

Also, spring for the All Weather Package. It really doesn't cost that much to add, and the heated side mirrors are really nice to have. The de-icers at the windshield wipers are really nice as well.

Dear 2017 Forester owners. I desperately need a feedback. I bought this brand new Forester with all the bells and whistles. Like any new car it had an upholstery smell which generally goes away with time but not in this car. I have been driving this car now for almost 2 months. My whole body would smell like old leather or shoe polish including from my breath. I always owned a new car but never a Subaru. This smell turned into headaches and lightheadedness and watery eyes when I turned my Heater on few days back. To experiment whether it is me only I told my wife to test drive with my son. Just 30 minutes into driving she started getting headaches and watery eyes. She had to stop the car and tell my son to go on the back seat to avoid a/c due to he getting nauseated. I took the car to dealer who found nothing wrong and referred me to Subaru tech team and I am still waiting to hear from them. I have kept my windows open but no improvements. I am so scared to drive because of headaches and drowsiness kicking in. Can someone please let me know if they are going through the same. One article I read showed in 2007 study that Forester was one of the 10 worst car for toxic fume in the cabin. I don't think since 2007 they have done any improvement in the quality of material they are using. Surprisingly only  Forester was mentioned and no other Subaru models were mentioned. I felt so bad that I leased this vehicle. If they don't take back I don't know what my options are. Please any advice is highly appreciated. Jay,neg
"Loved the Elite. Great car. Took it to Telluride  and San Diego from El Paso during the summer both about 9 hour drives. Splurged for the AWD, top of the line. Last week when I was driving it , I noticed the transmission jerking and not shifting appropriately. Mind you I did two summer cruises in this car. Few days later my wife tells me the car is accelerating in a jerking way. I told her I noticed it too and suggested we take it to the dealer. Guess what, the computer found nothing. The car is not the same. They have a new fancy 9 speed transmission and it has PROBLEMS!  I did a quick Google search and I am not alone. Honda is not addressing it , like the Takata air bag issues. BTW I have a 2009 Ridgeline waiting for new air bags to arrive on recall. I will open up a case with Honda North America and take it back to the dealer if the problem persists. I am sure they will say it's my imagination. My options are burn the car, sell the damn thing or trade it in for a lower level pilot with the old 6 speed transmission. I should have known a new model with new this, that new fancy transmission might have new PROBLEMS. My Mercedes CLS 500 the first year they made it has been in the shop more times than I can count. I thought Honda was different than the fancy German cars but I was wrong. It was the Pilot, Audi Q7, Toyota Highlander, and several others with 3 rd row of seats my wife looked at. Honda had the best reviews, picked 2016 SUV of the year. That's why we bought it.  Now I am ready to crash the damn thing into the dealership and set it on fire. Buyer be ware. The new fancy 9 speed transmission has problems. Others might not notice it . It can be a subtle difference, but we did because of our summer road trips. I guess a few dozen people have to die for Honda to wake up. Just like the air bags.",neg

"At 6'6"", my options are limited, but I'm positive I'd buy the same car again even if I magically lost 11 inches. This car is fuel efficient but powerful, spacious but compact, elegant yet utilitarian... it's paradoxically the best of both worlds in every category. I went for the 2.5i Premium Black Edition, and it's ridiculously slick. The steering-responsive headlights were a luxury I didn't know I needed, but now I can never go back -- driving through the woods and backroads at night will never be the same. I can't say enough good things about this car, so instead I'll just identify the VERY FEW areas that could see improvement:

-- The driver sits a little high. at 6'6"" I still fit great, but it's a slightly unfamiliar position.

-- The CVT can feel kind of chunky at lower speeds. It's not a big deal at all, but I need to find something Subaru can do better for the 2019!",pos
"The vehicle looks great! However, the small 1.5L engine feels like it’s struggling at times to pull the weight of the vehicle.

The steering wheel in the EX isn’t leather wrapped, making you feel like you’re gripping a CHEAP piece of plastic.  Transmission struggles to keep up compared to the Accord CVT and the Civic CVT.

This vehicle went every where twisty mountain road, logging roads due to great ground clearance.  Heavy rain wasn't an issue either.

"...and it may sound petty, but I just can't due to all of the issues I've had with UConnect. I have an iPhone 4s and have NEVER, since purchasing the vehicle brand new in Jan. '13, been able to have a reliable connection with my Bluetooth. Yes, that is a VERY minor issue, but if I didn't want those features in a vehicle, I could have spent far less money on something more basic. However, having those features (i.e.: back-up camera, navigation, bluetooth connectivity, etc.) were something I wanted. Almost every time I connect my phone via Bluetooth, one of two things occurs: 1) it takes almost 10 minutes for the connection to work successfully or, more fun 2) the entire screen and all associated controls, freeze. I live approximately 40 minutes from my place of employment and since purchasing my Grand Cherokee, I have driven that 40 minute commute with the back-up camera still active almost 5 times. Unacceptable. When these little ""freezes"" occur, you can't do anything associated with the Nav screen; no navigation, you can't change the radio station, you can't change the volume, nothing. It won't even turn off! Often, the screen will stay on even after the vehicle is in park and I've exited and locked it. At this point I'm not sure what's worse, the fact that I own what could, in theory, be a great car, but it just doesn't live up to the hype, or the poor customer service response I've received from Jeep. Basically they tell me that I have to either live with the computer constantly freezing or just not utilize the bluetooth. Why would I have spent the money on a vehicle with bells and whistles that I cannot even use?!

The bearing failure seemed a common problem for all Honda vehicles. I owned another vehicle i.e Honda Accord 2010, it's also had a bearing failure after 60,000 miles, and had to pay to repair. There may be a design problem, which is weight balancing is one side heavier than the other,  and that caused one side bearing worn out faster than other side.",neg

Still no fix for the vibration issue -don't even bother to ask-same answer, after 1.5 years.  Everything else about my CRV is just fine.  Spartan interior and functional. Nav system is counterintuitive and not easy to program., you get used to it.  Still think it does not live up to its hype-a lot of other choices for 33k(touring model).",neg

"I have owned 4 SUV's, including two Ford Expedition Eddie Bauer editions. I decided I wanted something with better mileage and after driving seven different brands, I opted for the 2014 Toyota Highlander. I choose a Limited version w/ an MSRP of $43,903 and got an excellent deal by working two dealers until I got the price I wanted. The vehicle is one month old tomorrow and it is simply fantastic. Love all of the features, the steering and ride is nothing short of perfect. I'm tall and on the heavy side, but I fit in the Highlander as easily as I do my Expedition. Gas mileage is outstanding and my family loves it too. If you're in the market for a new SUV, drive the Highlander....you won't be disappointed!!!",pos

"I took delivery of a 2015 Forester as my company fleet vehicle 3 months ago.
18,000 miles later I remain unimpressed.
Where to begin? The seats. This car is a base model with manual seats. A park bench is more comfortable and probably more supportive. I have driven my Chevy Silverado for 10 hours straight with no issue, but now I have to stop and walk around every two hours.
The power? It sort of seems like it there might be some in there somewhere, but it's never around when you want it. Floor it to scoot across an intersection and torque management comes on so hard you can take a nap while it decides whether or not to move.
Four wheel drive is unpredictable, shifting torque around seemingly at random. Once it sent so mush torque to the front that the steering effectively locked due to torque steer.
In snow it slips, skids, and fishtails all over the place. It took every bit of 4x4 traction control just to get up my driveway (wife's 2014 Mazda 6 with summer tires had no trouble).
But best of all is the heat...or lack of it. It was 25 today. With the grill completely blocked by duck tape, it never got above 190^. I drove all day with the temp turned all the way up, wearing long underwear and 3 shirts and never broke a sweat. Hopefully the company will let me switch to a minivan before it gets below zero!",neg
"Comfort, quietness, smooth ride (probably due to being new).  Suitable for us as a family of four.  Great travel vehicle.  Planning to keep this in the family for at least 15 years until the girls go to college.  Only drawback, when your flooring the gas pedal the Highlander has a hard time figuring out when to shift to the next gear.  I noticed that when you floor the car, it will pull hard but the RPM is revving high up to 5000 RPM but the gear doesn't shift to the next fast enough.  I don't know about other owners, but that is weird.  Usually when you floor a vehicle, it should only take a second of so to shift 1-2-3-4-5.  My RPM sits up in the 5000 range for about 2 seconds then drops to the next gear.  Overall, satisfy with purchase.",pos
This Forester rides more smoothly than my 2006 model. it's roomier and brighter inside. It's also a little higher and less boxy than my previous Forester.,pos
The car performs fairly well.  I've had it less than one month.  The biggest problem is the vibration that occurs when the car is stopped.  The radio and navigation controls are not well positioned and I'm unclear about the usefulness of the right turn camera.  I am having some buyer's regrets.,neg

"Disappointed in the 2016 CR-V.    It has a serious vibration issue.  It appears that the vehicle was not designed to minimize the impact of the vibration of the engine and the entire car is constantly vibrating regardless of the condition of the road.  In  stop and go city driving it is less noticeable, but it becomes immediately apparent when maintaining speed at 45 mph and gets much worse at highway speeds - 65 to 70 mph.    I did not see this issue mentioned in any online reviews and it was not noticeable in the test drive.  I have subsequently discovered that there are many other CR-V owners with the same complaint and a class action suit has been filed against Honda.   Honda acknowledges that the problem exists in some 2015 CR-Vs and claim they have developed a fix.   They supposedly resolved the issue for the 2016 model, but that is not the case.  Dealership has tried to fix it, but to no avail.   It appears  it is unlikely there will be a fix.   In order to get increased fuel efficiency, they have sacrificed comfort for drivers.    If you do any long range highway driving, I recommend that you do not buy this vehicle.   I know many other loyal Honda owners and they have always been satisfied and impressed with the quality of the vehicles.    Sadly, that is not the case with the 2016 CR-V.  I will be getting rid of this car after owning it for less than 1 month.",neg
"We've always owned Honda...for the majority of our marriage.  The Subaru was a new purchase, we don't lease, now that we are done with totting kids around and don't need the Mother van.  I've found most features disappointing or annoying on the 2016 Forester. The Accelerator pedal is so small, it makes my 5'2""frame tired after driving 45 minutes.   The carpet is so cheap, the blonde hair in our family makes the black carpet look forever dirty.  The ""fuel release"" lever is on the floor vs. the vertical floor board near the break pedal, so it's always dirty.  I hate the ""LURCH'  in the accelerator.   I hate the beeping of the seat belt warning @ 3 miles an hour, so you can't move your car from one spot in your garage to another with buckling up.  I hate the change box, you can't plug in your phone with spilling the change.  I hate there's no place for a woman's purse...and if you throw it onto the passengers seat, you have to ""buckle it in"" because 3-5 pounds sets off the alarm to buckle.  I regret NOT BUYING a HONDA even though I got the Subaru because I did not want all the silly bells and whistles the CR-V offered.",neg

"Very disappointing experience! Leased the Jeep Cherokee 2015 without knowing there has been a history of transmission issues. Found that out after the car died on the highway. My Jeep had been skipping gears,running sluggish and hesitating but I never imagined it could be a problem with the transmission. I waited over 3 hours for the Chrysler Road Side Assistance to show up and tow me to the nearest dealer, it took 3 days to get an approved rental while they replace my transmission.

"Want a non luxury vehicle with lot's of features and bang for the buck ? Look no further. This is my first Subaru, and I love it ! The updates for the 2017 Forester are great and much improved from previous models. It is extremely quiet, more refined interior...I have the Saddle Brown leather...beautiful ! Exterior is Dark Gray, and looks sharp on my Touring model. The premium stereo sounds awesome, and the bluetooth is very clear. It is a fun vehicle to drive, and it offers no blind spots which is rare these days ! While it is not a fancy interior, everything is practical, and offers plenty of room for passengers and cargo. Lots of technology in the upper trim levels along with memory seats, heated seats, and a heated steering wheel. The 4wd is the best out there, so get it one and go !
UPDATE : 
I have owned the Forester for 8 months now...zero problems, getting ready for my first oil change and 5000 check- up. This is such a fun vehicle to drive !! I have been averaging 25 -27 mpg between city and highway driving. Very pleased with this mileage. I get lots of compliments with the look ! Eyesight safety is awesome and works flawlessly, and I so enjoy the sirius radio. The sound system in the Touring is awesome ! I highly recommend this vehicle to someone looking for the perfect size SUV...not too small, not to big, easy to park ! Solid, dependable !!",pos

Only disappointment was that routine maintenance was not included during the warranty period.,pos
Technically everything works but there are a lot of design flaws that you wouldn't notice until you have the vehicle for a few weeks.  Problems using phone. It doesn't recognize voice 70% of time.  Heat on the feet is positioned weird.  Warms up your ankles instead. Can't make a call while right turn signal is on because of right side camera. Lever to adjust driver seat is in bad spot and gets bumped every time I exit vehicle.  Volume control for radio is a small and weird location on left side of display. Radio display never appears when I turn on vehicle. Always defaults to setting display.  Still think there is a vibration when vehicle idles at stop signs.   Wish I never bought it!!,neg
"I test drove many vehicles in this segment and ended up buying the 2016 Pilot AWD Touring model and think this is the best 3 row/8 passenger SUV on the market. Pros: Provides great value and price point in the segment. Ample passenger space in all rows. Interior is well done, borderline luxury-like as it feels like an Acura. Honda Sensing is great and at a good value. MPG is solid and don't need to shell out for premium gas unlike luxury SUVs in the segemnt. Infotainment screen is large and fairly responsive. Blind spot camera is a nice feature. Drive is smooth and powerful, accelerates quick off the line. Don't get why people complain about the push button transmission, I think it's done very well, each button has either a different tactile feel, clicking motion or size and looks very modern. Garmin GPS system is much better than stock GPS units you see in most cars. Paddle Shifters are a nice and gives a sporty feel. Also, you wouldn't expect it, but it's one of the best in class for offroading, traction control and AWD systems, just check out the Fast Lane Tests on Youtube. Big plus for me was the availabillity of an HDMI port and electrical outlet for Rear Entertainment System. The 2nd row Sunshades are a very nice feature as well, especially when you have small kids. The 20 inch rims are very stylish as well. The Cons: No Carplay/Android Auto (HUGE Oversight, especially for a car that's advertised as the ""Modern"" family vehicle.) No HDMI input for infotainment screen (C'mon, at the very least, include this if you're not giving us Carplay/Android Auto). The cargo space isn't that large when using all seats. And while the exterior styling is MUCH improved from that hideous box design, I wanted/expected more. The car does look much better in person than in pics though. Overall, considering the features and value, I think the 2016 Pilot is best in class.",pos

"My fifth Subaru. Bought my first in 1973. I've been a satisfied return customer several times. However, the intermittent lurching on slow acceleration, which has been evident since I purchased this 2017 Forester 17 months ago (current mileage approx 15,000 miles), is both annoying and dangerous.

Rav 4 did have a super smooth transmission.

"I purchased my 2016 Honda Pilot in September 2015 and did not notice transmission issues or temperature issues at first but they have steadily increased over the months.  I now have owned it for almost 5 months and have brought it in to be serviced twice due to transmission and temperature gauge issues.  I am so disappointed with the lack of support from Honda regarding their transmission issues.  My Pilot does not accelerate properly, in fact I have to push hard on the pedal for it to accelerate and it shifts at the incorrect times and causes me major issues when driving up hill or on the interstate.  My local Honda dealer had a tech drive it and he said he felt the issue but could not fix it since the ""computer"" found no issue with the transmission.  That is completely unacceptable.  

I am also having issues with my Pilot not properly warming up on cooler days and the heated seats are a joke.  The heated seats do not warm up properly and the temperature is no different for the Low or High setting.  Again, this was reviewed by my local Honda dealer but was told once again that they could not fix it because the ""computer"" could not find anything wrong.  Again, unacceptable.

Feedback to negatives:
Burning oil: Its a CVT, it requires synthetic oil. Duh 
Red console: While red is the hardest color in the spectrum to read, it is also the easiest on the eyes. It is safer to have red, blue/white= bad. This SUV provides for a very comfortable ride & not as loud as described. Quick Acceleration: Reminds me to slow down & saves gas. 

I'm slowly becoming a Subaru dude. I don't know what that means, but my friend says I will start eating granola.

"It is very disappointing.  Does not handle like my other Pilot.  Chassis like a car, steering like a car, beeps like a mini van. Acceleration is horrible and chugs out trying to accelerate into merging traffic. Only 1 charger outlet and 2 usb in the whole car which is much less than my other pilot.  Wish I had never bought it.",neg
"This is a great Crossover with few compromises.  We cross shopped the typical competitors; Honda, Mazda, Hyundai, GM, etc.  Given we have/had a Mazda CX-5 and 6, thought it was natural we would end up in the CX-9.  The CX-9 had too many compromises in practicality and options that didn't over come the driving fun part - this is a family commuter.  The Honda is a good cross over but we needed 2nd row captain chairs and the transmission / weird UI was not worth the money stepping up to the Elite trim on the Honda.  The Highlander has safety options like adaptive cruise, blind spot monitoring, lane departure, pedestrian collision avoid, rear cross traffic alert, and adaptive high beams.  There are even more goodies that add up in terms of practicality and comfort.  Items like 2nd row shades, heated front seats, heated mirrors, large 8""UI screen, 5 USB outlets, tri-climate control, leather seating in front rows, full function moon roof, a intercom system, solid V6 / 8spd auto, auto start/stop, ample small storage-notably the mid-shelf in the dash, power liftgate, reclining seats in the 2nd and 3rd row too, and a window hatch that opens independent of the rear gate!  For us the Captains / bucket seats in the 2nd row was a must because of having supervision for multiple car seat riders that can be tended to without crazy gymanastics.  All the above without having to step up to the top expensive trims; like in other brands. The higher trims on the Highlander have nice options but not worth the money for our lifestyle.
Worth test driving the competition but currently there is no comparison in our minds in terms of the options, safety, reliability, and over all package performance.  Keep the factory add on's to a minimum and you can get a good out the door price; keeping in mind you are in the market for a 3 row cross over.  Online price comparisons don't always talk about the dealer fees and sales tax but it adds up. We were out the door for no more than $40K (2017 HL XLE AWD - Silver - Cptn Chairs  OPTs - All weather mats, rear bumper protector)  Good luck and safe driving.",pos
"We travel to Florida for the winter each year and wanted a vehicle that we could load all our stuff plus two cats and a kayak and drive comfortably.   The Highlander hit the spot.   What I most like about this SUV is simple the way it drives.  It's smooth, quiet and comfortable.  It has a very solid feeling on the highway.   Visibility is not the greatest which is typical of any SUV but the blind side monitors are great for lane changing.  I would not have this vehicle without this feature.   The Toyota Entune tech package with NAV, is fantastic and easy to setup and use.    Only a couple of minor complaints with this SUV.  When you open the glove box door it hits the passenger in the legs.  It needs to be raised.   Also I bought the Limited version believing it had most everything I wanted, and I was a little disappointed to discover that it didn't have automatic high beam/dimming.    Other than that, it has about everything my Cadillac DTS has on it.    I looked at 3 other vehicles, the Pathfinder which was a nice vehicle but was a bit noisy, and the new GMC Acadia which was also quite nice but overpriced - about $8,000 more than a comparatively equipped Pathfinder.  Our local dealer, Capital Toyota in Chattanooga was very hospitality and easy to deal with.  I highly recommend this vehicle to anyone looking for a mid sized SUV.",pos

"Our family purchased a 2016 Honda Pilot Elite based on Honda's good reputation and experience we've had with other Honda vehicles.  Unfortunately the 2016 Honda Pilot Elite, which comes with the 9 speed transmission, has serious transmission problems .  We travel a lot and after owning the vehicle for 1 1/2 years already have 69 thousand miles on our Honda Pilot Elite.  Problems with the transmission started at 53 thousand miles while driving on the highway at which time the vehicle's transmission went out unable to shift out of the gear it was in.  Multiple display warning lights came on causing us to drop the car off at a Honda dealership out of town while on vacation.  The dealership recognized the transmission issue which reset itself after the car was parked in their shop for several hours.  Diagnostic testing failed to reveal any defects.  After picking up our vehicle which appeared to be functioning normally, the same problems started againg at 69 thousand miles.  After bringing our vehicle in to the local Honda dealership additional tests were done.  The transmission problem was again recognized by the Honda Service department, however no diagnosis was able to be made after updating software, changing transmission fluid and consulting directly with Honda Corporate.  We were lead to deal with Honda Corporate regarding our transmission issue as the vehicle's transmission was now no longer under warranty (ending at 60 thousand miles).  Although the initial transmission issue occurred at 53 thousand miles Honda has refused to cover the cost of our transmission.  The customer service at Honda Corporate was not what we expected from a reputable company such as Honda. Our Honda has been in the shop for 1 1/2 weeks now without having any work done on it since Honda will not agree to cover our transmission problem.  Since the Honda dealership was unable to diagnose the transmission problem while under warranty, they felt justified in passing the bill to us, the Honda customer.   We followed the Honda maintenance schedule and brought the vehicle in when the service lights presented themselves on our display.  It is apparently recommended that the Honda Pilot undergo transmission fluid changes every 30 thousand miles costing approximately $250 each service.  Our Honda Pilot was at the Honda dealership at 32K and 45K miles and thereafter, it was never recommended to us to change the transmission fluid.  Honda Corporate appeared to use this information against us to hold us responsible to pay for the failed transmission.  A district manager from Honda made a decision that we'd be responsible for $750 of the repair while Honda would cover the rest of the $6200 transmission.  Although better than paying for a new transmission, this problem occurred while under warranty and Honda is not living up to their promise or reputation.  The district manager who is responsible for deciding how much the Honda customer is responsible for paying apparently will not speak directly to the Honda customer, interesting to us.  We have already incurred the cost of a rental car while on vacation due to this problem and will be without our Honda Pilot for at least 2 1/2 weeks for the transmission repair not including the number of hours dealing with various customer service representatives getting to the point we are at now waiting for our transmission repair.  We are disappointed with Honda's handling of our transmission problem which will inevitably affect many more Honda owners in the future as most drivers of these vehicles have yet to place as many miles on the 2016 Honda Pilot as we have.",neg

Beware of the elite and touring 9 speed models. The transmission is terrible. It actually speeds up going down hills.

"To start simply, this car had a rebuilt engine and transmission within the first 2,500 miles. I was warned in years past never to buy a new model's first year because the companies are usually working out kinks and i wish i listened. The engine started overheating really badly at about the 1,800-2,000 miles mark. I bring it in to the dealer and those inept mechanics told me it was a faulty spark plug or something and gave me the car back next day. Within three days i had to bring the car back and on this second trip they told me the engine got so hot it cracked the engine block! Three or four weeks later i get the rebuilt car back and within 10 days of that, the transmission was completely out of whack. I bring it back and about a week later they ""fixed"" it and returned it to me. I fought with chrysler corporate for months to get me out of this car that i didn't feel safe in but they only care about their bottom line and basically told me to sue them. I don't have the money for lawyers especially for a lease so i'm left counting the days till i can dump this trash. I know one coworker who had similar problems to me but because he financed his he went the whole 9 yards got a lawyer and the car was deemed a lemon and he got his money back.

"This is our 4th Subaru. Previously owned Impreza 2007, Forester 2011 and Outback 2013. I got to say, I'm extremely disappointed with 2017 Forester. Aesthetically it is very appealing and during the test drive everything appears to be great. Well after driving for 5 thousand miles and couple of smaller road trips, we realized that ride quality is very poor,  it feels like the car wobbles side to side like a carriage and because of the wobble it you constantly have to correct the wheel for it to go straight, especially at higher speeds. My 2011 Forester went dead straight and we went 2500 road trip in our 2013 Outback and it felt perfectly safe. My guess is that Subaru is trying so hard to appeal to general public with wrong tastes for so called ""softer ride"" they completely ruined what used to be an amazing line of cars. I would not recommend anyone getting Forester 2017, I wish i could take an extended drive in a car before we leased it and now we are stuck!",neg

"I am a long time/+30 year jeep owner, have owned just about every version type of Jeep & when the Cherokee was brought back, I was excited, then seeing it on the road the 1st time, I couldn't wait to test drive it, so rented it for a week. 1st the good; it looks great, the front seats are some of the most comfortable I have ever sat in a car, up there with our Mercedes. It has a lot of space inside. Now the bad; the transmission on this thing is the worst I have ever driven, 9 gears, with a gate shifter, I couldn't wait to play with it, it takes over a second for it to shift in each gear, huge disappointment. The shifter is designed so you can't put your whole hand around the shifter, due to the closeness of the center armrest to the shifter, when I shifted I had to hold my hand in an awkward & uncomfortable u-shape, Jeep/Dodge engineers really?. The dash looks like it is from a 1987 Lebaron, with the strip light indicators for all of the gauges. The steering controls are terrible, just the Cruise control controls on the right take up no less then 5sq inches of space. There was no volume control on the steering wheel, the most commonly used button. Maybe just our trim level, but the stereo is the worst stereo I have ever heard in a new car, we had to turn the bass all the way down so the dash didn't rattle, which reminds me the dash rattles regularly. It has the turning radius is horrible. The cargo space in the rear is the worst I have seen, was excited to see the cargo departments under the main cargo floor above the tire, but you can only fit a soda can width items in there, the cargo floor is not hinged, if you want to pull something out of the bottom cargo space you have to remove everything from the rear cargo floor, which would be great on long road trips to pull everything out. There is a weird, metal bracket thing on the left, that looks like there was a lot of thought into it/engineering, but you pull its handle & it just falls down as it is heavy & serves no purpose. The engine in our trim level has little power even in sport mode. This is a poorly thought out vehicle, wish the designers, engineers, ceo's would take 1 drive in an Audi, even a Ford or a Kia to understand how well thought/worked out those cars are. My wife didn't like it as well, we ended up buying a Kia instead of the Cherokee & it is in a completely different/higher league than the Cherokee. Very disappointed in Jeep.",neg
This car is incredible.  Very roomy and great car for me and my family.,pos
"I'll keep it short - don't buy a Cherokee.  I bought a new 4 cyl. 2015 Cherokee and after driving it on the freeway for a few hundred miles the car started to have acceleration issues.  They claimed it was the transmission, it took them over 30 days to fix it, when I got it back it did the same thing again.  I then fought Chrysler & the Dealership for a replacement vehicle and after 4 months they gave me one (although I had to pay extra for the new one since it was a 6 cyl.) and the car is still unreliable and has issues.  The shifting between gears is weird, it is not smooth at all, the transmission frequently kicks, the car doesn't get out of gear sometimes and not to mention the 6+ recalls I've had in less than a year.  Yes it's a good looking car but it isn't worth it.  Don't buy one, I regret mine.",neg
"Do not buy the Honda CR-V Honda knows there is a serious problem with vibration,shaking and poor gas mileage. This car will make you sick driving it. It shakes like a 20 year old car and the gas mileage is at least a third less than advertised. You will get no satisfaction from Honda concerning the shaking as they claim this is characteristic of the vehicle. The sleazy dealer Metro Honda in Johnston RI sold us this vehicle with full knowledge of the defect in it. This is by far the worst vehicle I have ever purchased. Don't make a huge mistake by purchasing this car. This car still disappoints two years after purchase. It runs like crap and is a total junk.",neg
"I recently purchased a 2017 Highlander XLE while my 2010 Prius (107,000 miles) was getting an oil change.  Call it an ""impulse"" buy, but I had been researching the Toyota Highlander for quite some time and with 0% financing available & a great deal from the local dealership, I left my Prius in the service department and drove home a brand new 2017 Highlander in Celestial Silver Metallic.  I've now had it a little over a week.  Initial impression?  Fantastic vehicle.  Very quiet.  User-friendly. Creature comforts that aren't ""over-the-top"".  Entune system is great.  Of course, I'm putting more gasoline in it than my former Prius, so that will take some getting used to.  My biggest surprise?  I emailed my insurance agent to change coverage over to the Highlander and it is over $100/year CHEAPER to insure the brand new 2017 Highlander than it was to insure a 2010 Prius!!  What does that tell me?  This vehicle is safe on the road.  The sight lines are much better than the Prius (that's not really saying much) and the Blind Spot Monitoring (BSM) is very helpful along with the Lane Departure Alert (LDA).  I am enjoying driving a bigger vehicle and will write another review after the ""newness"" factor wears off a bit.  For now,  very impressed and confident in this purchase.  More to come, later...",pos
"Bought in March. Now that weather is warming, I find that the A/C is not cooling effectively. Also, as many, many others have noted, the vibrations when in drive at a stop sign/light can cause equilibrium issues and have caused me to suffer from nausea on a couple occasions. Drove a Pilot for 10 years and hoped this car would equal the quality and reliability I experienced with the Pilot; alas, it is not to be. If the dealer from whom I purchased doesn't ""do the right thing,"" I will gladly trade for something else. Fuel savings is great, but no trade-off if I am going to get nauseous each time I drive it.",neg
"This is my third Toyota Highlander and I'm in love all over again with my new 2017 Highlander!  It is a classy, reliable vehicle that does not disappoint.  The gas mileage is phenomenal.  I love all of the technology.   I have nothing negative to say about it, except for a bit of disappointment in the quality of interior (ie floor mats are not nearly as sturdy as the ones in my 2010).",pos
The vehicle is very roomy and comfortable.  The ride is quiet and smooth.  The AWD handled so well in the snow.  I was sold after the test drive.,pos
"Worst new car I ever bought. Evident vibrations at idle. Brought to service 4 times including a different location. All said it was normal. In the old days they would have adjusted the idle, cleaned the carburator and or fuel pump. Couldn't wait to trade in after 1 year. When I was at speed it was fine, but at idle very uncomforting to feel and I mean FEEL the vibrations, especially when the A/C was on..",neg

"We bought our 2015 CRV wanting to keep it for a longtime, but with the vibration issues it doesn't look like thats going to happen. I can't believe that Honda would allow this vehicle to be sold without a notice to the consumer. If they disclosed the vibration issue it wouldn't be the #1 selling SUV. Honda really ruined the brand with me. I have owned 4 Accords, 2 Pilots, we just bought my daughter a HRV and now this piece of junk CRV. This is the last Honda I will buy.",neg
"This car has a radio issue that has yet to be addressed by Honda.  It crackles, fades, and volume fluctuates.  It seems to go in and out of mono and stereo on a radio station that is right down the street from me.  The speedometer is too high on the dash and from my seating position I can only view it when I look under the top of the steering wheel.",neg
"I bought a brand new 2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee, It has 2501 miles on it, and it's in the shop waiting for a new motor,  that is on back order for 2 months.  Problems with the block, had some manufacturer errors, there are some bubbles in the casting.  The oil of course leaked out these bubbles.  Called the Jeep company, I get a case number and told I will be called back, on the next business day. Still haven't received a return call.

Finally heard back from the Jeep (Chrysler) Company, Talked to the Case Manager.  The engine was expedited and the shop received the motor in about 3 days, instead of 2 months.  I let them know I was very unhappy and I wanted to trade this vehicle for another new vehicle because I did not want to deal with potential future problems after replacing the motor.  Needless to say, that didn't happen. I was basically told that they would do nothing more, no swapping it for another vehicle, no buying it back, unless it became a legal matter.  But I was more than welcome to talk to the sales department of one of their dealers and see what kind of deal they could do for me. (So basically trade it in).   I went and picked up the Jeep, and traded it in is exactly what I did, and it wasn't with a Chrysler Corporation.  I will never buy any kind a vehicle from the Chrysler Corporation again.",neg

I have only had this car for a little over a week.  I can say though that I had 2003 Forester that I drove into the outback on my own and I always came back safe and sound.  I just had to go with another Forester when I bought a new car (major engine repairs needed and I just went new rather than repairs to around 3K....it was a tough decision!).  I love this new car with all the bells and whistles.  Yet to know if I end up trusting it as much as the 2003.  Time only tells.  So far so very good.,pos
"I have been locked out of this vehicle more than 5 times in 3 months. The keyless entry system does not recognize the FOB, during these times. Chrysler says since it cannot be duplicated at the dealership, my complaint has been closed. The dealer has been understanding, and done what Chrysler has recommended. It has been concluded that it is caused by radio interference, when I park in certain places. Now I have instructions to open the door with the key and use the FOB to depress the start button.",neg
"I've had three Highlanders. And there is absolutely nothing NOT to love. Style, comfort, reliability...all good qualities of a nice SUV. No complaints at all !!!!",pos
Traded mine in with just over 20k miles.  Simply the least reliable vehicle I've ever owned.  Traded in for a Subaru and couldn't be happier.,neg
Quick update from last weeks review. I mentioned the Engline light came on the very next day after having several software updates. Dealer says it now needs a NEW TRANSMISSION after light comes again! 3500 miles and you need a new transmission is alarming to say the least. I don't believe Jeep has done their home work on the 9 speed transmission/software to properly have a smooth running vehicle. Many others have had this same issue. Luckily for us the vehicle kept running and we weren't stranded somewhere on the highway on a vacation.,neg
"My wife and I have a Lexus GX470 and I traded a Mercedes CLK430 for a Highlander. We looked at the Lexus RX but I cannot stand the new Lexus styling. We test drove the Highlander and we were very impressed. We didn't want all the fancy electronics (like the radar) on the Highlander Hybrid and choose the XLE instead. The interior ride is exceptionally quiet. Everything works and I love the horizontal shelf built into the front dashboard. It doesn't have a wood steering wheel like our Lexus, but the build quality is great. I would highly recommend.",pos
"I purchased my 2016 Honda Pilot in September of 2015. I was fairly happy with the purchase, but I did notice some unusual transmission experiences. Well this week, it got worse. The gears banged into place and made loud noises. Sometimes it would not shift and just stay in gear with the engine revving really high and then banging into the next gear.

The problem? The cooling coil in the transmission failed causing anti-freeze and trans fluid to mix throughout the transmission and the cooling system. According to the dealership, this is the third one they've seen like this in their shop. They also told me that their friends who work at the Acura dealer nearby are having the exact same issue with the MDX. They are going to replace my transmission and flush the cooling system. The car has 18,000 miles on it.",neg
"Do not entertain the idea of trying a vehicle with a 9-speed. My 2015 Jeep Cherokee has been in the shop 7 times since I bought it a year and half ago. 9-speed transmission has no idea whether it's coming or going. RPMs spike (3500-4000) when going down or up hill and does not lower till you're on the straightaway. By that point, you have minimal power and when the transmission figures out what gear to be in, it clutters/jolts and puts you in a lower gear then you can continue accelerating.     When approaching a STOP SIGN or you YIELD, you slow down and then accelerate and the transmission hesitates then shutters to get you going. My dealerships states ""They are not able to duplicate the problem"" yet I drive it off their lot onto the roadway with these problems occurring. Service Manager rode with me so I can ""reproduce"" the issues and I was told ""It's normal"". I had a loaner from the dealership while Chrysler arranged for an engineer to work on fixing the transmission - the loaner was a Chrysler 200 Limited. This vehicle's transmission performed the same as my Jeep.",neg
"I just love my Highlander.  Leased a 2105 XLE but after driving it for a few months I found that I longed for the Limited edition.  I found that I prefer the captain chair seating along with all of the safety features that come with the Limited Platinum edition.  Not only do I love the safety features, it is really awesome to have the panoramic sunroof.  I live in Southern California where the weather is beautiful year round so I opted to not get the AWD version.  My only complaints are the price of the vehicle. It is quite pricey but for the features you get it is a WHOLE lot cheaper than the equally equipped luxury vehicles, such as Audi Q7 or the Infinit Qx6 which are  cars that  I was originally considering.  For the price point of this vehicle I also would prefer if the side view mirrors would automatically fold in without me having to fold them in manually.  I love the entune system which works quite well with my LG V10 cellphone which I also LOVE!  Being that I had the standard audio system on the 2015 Highlander XLE, I am able to speak to the quality of the JBL system I now have.  I am strictly a Pandora and bluetooth user and I will say the sound quality is far superior to the system that comes standard on the XLE model.  So, I can say that I like the JBL.  But, then again, I am not a radio listener and my music has HD quality because of the cellphone that I have.  I absolutely love my Highlander and since I am no longer leasing, I will be keeping 2016 Limited Platinum Highlander for many many years to come.",pos
"I love the power going up steep inclines which is provided by the all wheel drive.  I do not have to push the accelerator down as much as I had to with my Camry which had the same size engine, torque, and transmission.  All four wheels carry the Forester up the steep hills much easier than a two wheel drive car that pulls a vehicle up the inclines.  I can easily tell the difference, which is important to me since I have two steep inclines to travel up on my way home.",pos
"Review at 1000 miles:   We spent the last six months researching and test driving for our first new purchase.  We had a budget of $35k and the final three contenders were the BMW X1, Honda CR-V Touring and the Subaru Forester XT Touring.    We live at altitude in the Pacific Northwest and are ""outdoorsy"" without needing extreme off road capability.   We also take the highway up to fairly high altitudes for hiking and ski excursions.  Coming from a fun & spirited but extremely noisy and uncomfortable Impreza, we were looking for a good blend of comfort and utility.  Forester XT Touring satisfied these criteria with the added FUN factor that the CRV just didn't bring to the table.  The Forester XT has *almost* all of the get-up-and-go of a WRX with off road capability and a far, far quieter ride.  I find the CVT to be quite responsive, particularly in the Sport mode.  Interior comfort is impressive;  I'm 6'4"" and 220 lbs, and have so far taken three 2+ hour trips behind the wheel, on highway and Forest Service roads.  The cabin is quiet, with excellent visibility on all sides.   While not quite the same in terms of luxury, at this price point, to get the AWD on the X1, we'd have been dropping closer to $40k.  I just couldn't justify paying the premium for mostly a badge.  Only qualms so far is the entertainment suite: Starlink is basically useless aside from Pandora.  Navigation combined with Sirius XM traffic is quite useful.  Eyesight suite is powerful, useful and intuitive and is what ultimately swayed our purchase.  Considering our Impreza lasted reliable 275k miles with strict maintenance, I am confident that the Forester XT will be reliable for years to come and serve our needs well.",pos
"I bought my V6 4x4 Latitude last week, and I already regret it. The first issue was the suspension creaking while at a stop and turning the wheel. The second, is that the UConnect system is a pile of fancy garbage. It disconnects my phone, won't put calls though the speakers, doesn't recognize an iPhone as a USB device, drops SiriusXM connection frequently, radio has a lot of static, it's a nightmare to use. The third I have is the drivers seat sounds like a squeaking spring when I move, or go around corners. You have to shut off active start every single time you start the vehicle. The leather on the steering wheel is paper thin. My tow eyelet's missing. Transmission can't find a happy spot",neg
"I scheduled an appointment to complete the paperwork and take delivery of the car. After waiting for 5 hours I was given a 2017 Pilot as a free loaner and told to go home and return the next morning for my car. When I slid into the seat, it felt goooood!  About the only adjustment I had to make was to comfortably reach the pedals. The wife was similarly comfortable in the passenger seat. It was also a pleasure to drive, accelerating easily and shifting smoothly. The next morning I picked up my new car and headed home. I spent a good part of the time trying to find a comfortable position with the seat. It is smaller with a short cushion and large bolsters top and bottom. The front of the seat cushion was digging into my leg, so I tried to adjust it lower. The seat accomplishes that by raising the back which also moves you closer to the steering wheel. Now from that position it can't slide back.  So my hair is brushing the headliner, thanks to the moon roof that is standard, and I'm closer to the wheel than I like to be without an extreme recline.  I suppose I'll get used to it, but it is very disappointing to find such a poor seat in Honda's most popular car. It will never be a ""oh, that feels good"" experience. Even the steering wheel is uncomfortable being a hard plastic. Probably the Pilot's was wrapped in leather or cushioned. The center console in the Pilot was excellent. It is a low, flat, surface providing a nice open feeling in the cabin as well as the perfect place to plop a pocketbook. The armrests are on the seat and can be left up out of the way or lowerd down to a perfect position. The CR-V has a center console that is split level, leaving not much room for anything. Also there are no slots or small drawers anywhere in the dash for small items. Everything must be thrown into the center console. When accelerating, the CR -V engine has an initial hesitation and a strained growl. The Pilot responds quickly and easily with no strain. Of course the Pilot is larger and more expensive, but it might be worth the extra investment.",neg
"This little Jeep is awesome, I went with the Trailhawk L Plus v6 plenty of power, We dont get a lot of snow in TN. but we did get a little and The Trailhawk never broke traction. Great comfort on road trips and good gas mileage I am a lead foot though. cant wait for vacation to do some off road. The Wife wanted a suv and I wanted a 4x4 so its a win, win.",pos
"Yes, and in fact did! We loved my Cherokee so much that when my husbands car died, he bought a Cherokee, too! We live in a hilly area, get fair amount of snow, so 4WD is more than just nice, it can be essential for getting to work. This Cherokee is the most comfortable vehicle weve had, and we just love the bluetooth connectivity. The backup camera is so clear and easy to use. Do yourself a favor and take one for a test drive.",pos
"the day it left the lot, nothing but suspension problems, transmission problems. in shop total of 25days out of 30 days owned. Service repairman not instructed on new mechanics of this car. The new suspension on this car is horrible and transmission is punchy affected all passengers ride. jerks when slowing from 2nd to first gear not recommend this car",neg
"I want other owners to know that I bought a new 2016 Honda Pilot because I bought the first year 2009 Honda Pilot and drove it to 176k with no problems. I liked the old Honda and bought in to the new Honda because of the safety features and improved fuel economy. 

The bad
I can safely say after driving the fist 2,500 miles with the new Honda Pilot, this car is garbage. The fit and finish is horrible (needed to have two of the plastic panels replaced because they warped), needed to have the entire head unit taken off of the car because of an annoying noise (first 100 miles and two days in the shop), now the navigation system doesn't recognize commands, the stereo is anemic and often crackles and hisses. The only way to stop this is to turn the car on an off. So in a total of one month the car has been in the shop for a total of four days. This in comparison to the 2010 that never had an issue. 

The good
The safety features are great. The lane departure, lane assist, adaptive cruise and front end collision all work great. The econ also works great as I am consistently getting 30 mpg combined city and highway. That being said those are the pluses.",neg
"Have had my 2016 Forester for three weeks and about 800 miles. The CVT takes some getting used to , however, the gas mileage is impressive for all wheel drive, given this motor is not broken in yet and I'm getting 27.5 mpg in mixed driving. No rattles, issues or negative  impressions. Considered this vehicle because my wife has the 2012 model and loves it and no issues with her vehicle either. The Subaru dealership was great to work with and I feel I got a very good deal. Time will tell but so far this Forester is proving this was the right choice !!!

Have owned this Forester for six months now and here is my update. Still no issues with anything. Changed the oil at 2000 miles, my choice, and no excessive consumption. Given this is a new vehicle and the motor is  just braking in I'm very happy with it. Highway mileage is around 33 mpg. if I keep the speed under 70 mph. Over 70 and the mpg. drops quickly. At this point I would buy this vehicle again.

Do not buy a Honda until they replace the current infotainment system!  Screen goes dark randomly and often. Back up camera frequently does not come on. Bluetooth hands free intermittently will not make calls and/or drops calls. Dealer replaced system and new one does exactly same thing!  No cooperation from Honda. Honda America representative said they have no fix at the current time. Another representative said it could be my phone--IPhone 6splus or carrier--Verizon. Said it may not be compatible even though it works fine about 50% of the time. Car purchased new and now has only 5000 miles.

"I had a 2007 Jeep GC, and decided to go with a 2010 Toyota Highlander because the engine and transmission and electrical problems of the '07 GC absolutely turned my stomach. Fast forward to 2016 and looking at the new GC, I was impressed. The interior is awesome, and very classy, not a plastic feeling (like the highlander, and my previous GC). The drive is nice and firm, the steering is 100 times better than the Highlander. The feeling while driving on the highway is similar to my girlfriends BMW X3...sporty and quiet. The feel is more of a SUV (truck feel), rather than the highlander (which is Camry based). I am glad to buy American (even if Fiat owns Jeep)..better than the service and treatment I got from Toyota. The Jeep Dealer I went to was world class, and didn't try to push me into something I didn't want. I got what I wanted and I am very pleased with my decision. The rest of the world automakers, your on notice...time to step up your game (actually, your gonna have to wait a few years)!",pos
"The CRV uses more gas than expected. I am getting 27 miles/gallon in econo mode which leaves me with low power. Getting on the freeway in econo mode takes time but I don't want to have gas mileage lower than that. The gas tank is very small. When gas is getting low, you get a low fuel message and can't see how many miles you have left on the tank. The controls on the screen are impossible to see especially when the sun is shining on the touch screen. Sometimes it goes dim and you can't see the controls to change the AC or entertainment system at all. Or what they call an entertainment system. No CD player at all! The radio doesn't even play local stations that my 10- year old car played fine. The FM goes in and out and is really useless. You have to pay for Sirius to get any stations. But why pay for commercials?? The car is not worth the price I paid for it. I wish I had test driven it longer and checked out the controls better.  If you use the USB for example to play a book, the order in which it plays does not follow the order of the book. It is ridiculous. 

Update: Several months later, still feel the same about not being impressed at all and do not recommend buying a 2017 CRV.",neg

I have come to expect that of Subaru.",pos
"Great first impression! The view,stability and ride are exceptional. Feature comforts are easily accessible, and easy to get used to. It has been years since we have bought a new car, and advanced technology can be daunting. Subaru has done a great job of keeping the controls in a logical sequence. In future, a power seat for passenger would be nice to help with elderly or people who just had surgery. The Forester is the perfect height for baby boomers getting towards retirement age.",pos
"This is our first Honda vehicle and my wife and I really loved it! We really loved it due to its safety features - automatic hazard brakes, left, right and back sides sensors. The left and right sensors tell me as to when should I safely change lanes!! Our car is pearl black in color with black genuine leather seats. It is a very attractive car both in and out.

In addition to the transmission slowly going out, now the electronics in my instrument cluster are going out! A two year old car shouldn't have any of these problems. What a hunk of junk!",neg
"I have been a life long Honda fan and often bragged about how ""bulletproof"" the brand is. We purchased the new 2015 CRV-LX and I can say without an near equal this is the worst vehicle I've owned. It shakes and shudders and idle, the vibrations become maddening at higher speeds and engine races while switches gears with the RPM's jumping all over the place. It also takes forever to heat up and the power steering is so sensitive it constantly feelsike its out of alignment. So disappointed in Honda. I have 2004 Element with 160,000 miles on it and it feels like a Maybach compared to this new CRV. Called to complain and basically got the blow off. Unless Honda does something drastic they have certainly lost a customer for life in me and my family.",neg
"Spent many months researching before buying and ended up with an old favorite.  This is our second highlander and it is even better than before.  We found a 2017 certified used  (Dealer rental) and negotiated a real good deal.  Under $40,000 with 100,000 bumper to bumper warranty.  Only thing less than perfect are the front seat comfort is not quite soft enough for my old back (my wife who is picker than me has no complaints and thinks the ride is better than her Lexus) and the voice activated command is very temperamental.  I think that a little adjustment on my part will bring these up to Toyota standards.",pos
"I can said now that I’m a proudly ex-owner of a 2016 CRV (very expensive washer machine, massage chair…you name it), it was known to happen with the 2015s( service bulletin 15-046) but honda claims it was fixed(which is a lie), so I got a new crv 2016, my mistake, I only had it for 3 months and about 1500 miles but I had enough with the vibration issue, lucky me I felt all the 3 modes described in the 2015 bulletin,. The vibration started @ about 500 miles and getting worst every day, took the car back to the dealer (2 of them) first one told me it was normal, they all vibrate and this is a “characteristic of the car”, the second one agreed with me that it was vibrating but after 10 mins., came back with the same b**l S**t as the first one, what a waste of my time, I called honda and created a case, they assigned me a case manager that called me and kept repeating that’s a “characteristic of the car”( if so, how come is not listed in the brochure?), his only goal was to get me to agree with his stupidity, which I didn’t, I will never purchase a honda again, quality went down the toilet, is not a reliable car anymore and of course their service department sucks.",neg
"Reliable, great drive, easy handling and no fatigue, a bit punchy initial acceleration and effortless cruising, sure braking, easy getting in and out, great cornering, fantastic on snow and ice- full time dynamic AWD, traction control etc., great on gas (have got 41 on some trips), good cargo through hatch with back seats folded down and roof rack, great visibility but no tinting, uncomfortable in summer. Ok infotainment and electronics, phone pairing lost often, daylight savings does not stick. A bit stiff ride (needed for an SUV). Hood of soft material (aluminium perhaps) dropping acorns put three dents, body panels similarly feel soft. Body seems to have a bit of flexi which adds to its comfort on trails, not an extreme off-roader but enough for the unpaved trails.",pos
"This is the noisiest car I  have ever owned.  Terrible wind noise through the windows and the sun roof.  I consider the steering to be dangerous, as it almost pulled me off the road on a curve and constantly jerks to the right even when I am directly in the middle of the lane.  I've read complaints from others that this appears to be connected to the lane sway feature of the electronics (not the lane departure feature).  The dealer says it's all in my  head, although the loaner car they gave me was like a normal car that had smooth steering and the steering wheel didn't jerk once.  I consider my car a lemon and I regret buying it -- especially when the men who sold me this expensive car keep ignoring my complaints.",neg
"I owned a 2007 pilot, followed by a 2012 Odyssey, followed by last year we purchased a 2016 Honda Pilot Touring.  I love Hondas and really only had one car in mind when it was time to trade in my vehicle.  I have two small children so the entertainment system was definitely important.  I also drive a lot for work so a clear, easy to use Bluetooth is also a priority.  Honda features are great with no concerns.  Now the Bluetooth.  I have two iPhones 6 devices (one ATT and one Verizon).  When I go to make a call, it has to make a voice connection and THEN you have to touch transfer on the screen to get it to switch to Bluetooth.  So long for handsfree calling!!  I took it to Honda and they said it was a Handsfree Bluetooth issue and that I should contact them.  If you google it and look at their compatibility, it only is up to OS 8.3  (the current update was 10.2).  It does not even mention an iPhone 7, so good luck if you have that.  My second issue is the RES.  If you have a child that can work the remote, they can handle it from the back seat. Otherwise, you are screwed and will have kids yelling at you that the movie won't start and it started over every time you got back in the car while running errands.  (Once again, Honda says it is the new DVDs that just do not work).  If the DVD goes to a start menu, it will not start automatically.  Apparently, older DVDs may have an autoplay and those supposedly will work.  Either way, there is no control over the movie from the front seat.  After paying 48000 for a new Honda, it feels like a kick in the gut, when all of the older models are more sophisticated and operate better than the new 2016.",neg
"I've owned the 2017 Forester XT for about one month now. Here are come quick Pros and Cons:  Pros: I get drove several cars before deciding on this vehicle. Basically, you cant touch a car with a similar size, performance, value, resale value, engine, comfort, with any car in the price of 35K. The only other car I as excited about was the Mercedes GLC (Which was 60K out the door). The gas mileage is roughly 23mpg. Car handles well. It doesn't sit as low to the ground as my 2014 WRX, but I feel good around sharp turns and I have confidence in the car and its suspension (although I would have liked to the suspension to be 15-20% tighter). I like the infotainment system. The screen is big and it's easy to use. I didn't go with the Touring model instead I chose the premium and added a few things. The price point of the Touring for me wasn't worth it. I enjoy how high the car sits, I like it has plenty of room in the back seat and especailly for my  German Shepherd in the Trunk area. Overall, super happy with my purchase.   CONS: Subaru could have done a slightly  better job with the CVT. It's nice to drive when in sport mode but in economy mode the engine/transmission gear change lags big time. My biggest pet peeve though are the corn seats. I feel they could have been more ergonomic and better fitting. Im not a big guy, 5'8 and 160 lbs. But i feel the seat could do a better job keeping my in place instead of moving side to side around sharp turns. Other people I ride with say it's comfortable, so maybe I'm being picky. I really hope this review helps and Gluck hunting!",pos
"The Forester is an amazing car.  Not only is it perfectly beautiful to look at, a Jasmine Green, it is comfortable in so many ways.  We bought the tech package that has the eyesight capability (for lane changing) and the staying-in-your-lane technology.  I can't tell you how great this new technology is!  We got a trial of Sirius Radio, love that too, and the Starlink system is a marvelous safety feature.  Safe, comfortable, reliable, lovely -- we are in love with our car!",pos
"This is a nicely designed vehicle, howver, the Ipod/MP3 device is visible when connected. It would be great if a device could remain in place and somehow be concealed or out of view. The console cup holders can be annoying at times, because the holding clip is unstable and keeps popping out. They really don't hold small or medium sized cups too well. Platinum models should also have automatic folding mirrors when the vehicle is parked.

I just love the panoramic moon roof and luxurious interior!",pos
"I, like many others, have major issues with vibrations (mostly at idle). I was told by my dealership that I ""was the only one"" that complained of this. However, I went online and see it is indeed a problem with the 2015s in general, not my vehicle. I hope Honda does a recall soon to fix this or I will never buy a Honda again (and neither will my family and friends who experienced the vibrations in my car). In addition, I drive the highway and accelerate slowly with the eco button on, and can't get above 25.7 mpg on the highway.",neg
"The windshield area needs to be enlarged for better viewing.  For a tall person (6' to 6'4"") it is difficult when getting in the car due to the slope of the door as you have to bend down to keep from hitting your head on the frame.  The seating is fairly comfortable but the info system is not easy to operate.  The back of the car should be squared and not tapered as there is not a lot of space to look out the window of the back door.  Engine runs fairly smooth and overall good to handle.",neg
"Purchased it brand new in Sept 2015 , one year into it  ( 22k miles) developments a shifting problem  Made a clunking sound when it shifted from 4th to 5th plus lower gears were a bit sluggish. Had it in the shop 4 times , the last time a Jeep Tech looked at it, claimed he could not find anything wrong, however the noise happened about 10 times since he looked at it. There is numerous reviews on the internet about other people having the same problem. The 9 speed tranny is junk, had to trade it in and take a big hit Hate the car",neg
"I purchased this vehicle new from a dealer in Sept of 2014. I loved it at first (minus the stop/start feature) which I learned could be shut off by ""simply"" hitting a button EACH TIME YOU GET IN THE VEHICLE. They say it's a feature that is supposed to help with fuel usage, but I'm not sure how that could be good on a vehicle considering every time you come to a stop the car shuts down. First issue was when I would turn the vehicle to the right it would make a vibrating feeling on my steering wheel. I notified the service dept where I purchased the vehicle. I had the service manager ride along with me to show him (because the service tech couldn't get it to do it while he drove it). The service manager said it was normal and that it will take a couple of months for my car to get used to the way I drive. I've never heard of such a thing. I also asked him why he shuts down and shifts funny. He said that was also normal. So for the next year I drove the vehicle and assumed all of the hard shifting and kicking was normal since the SERVICE MANAGER said it was. During that time the car stalled on me in an intersection not once, not twice, but 3 times. It stalled on my dad who test drove it, as well as my husband. I had already notified the dealership multiple times. But again, it was ""normal"". Finally @ 19,xxx miles last week I was traveling the turnpike going approx. 65 mph the vehicle shut completely off and my dash started flashing. I was terrified and thankful nobody was behind me other wise I would have been re ended at a high rate of speed. I was able to coast over to the shoulder and had the vehicle towed to the service dept. It was giving me a ""service transmission"" message. I tried to move forward, but the car just rolled while giving it gas. I got a call that my car was fixed and ready for pick up 3 days later. I was told they ""cleared the codes and could not get it to duplicate"" which was not a good enough answer for me. I fought with the dealership telling them I didn't want to get back in that car because I was scared it would happen again. The service manager told me it had been fixed and would be okay. She said if it happens again, they may need to replace my transmission. She told me it was a known problem with that vehicle and that they wouldn't know unless it happens again. Still not satisfied with this answer I regretfully got in my jeep and drove home. I live in the country and take roads where I do not have cell service, so I was terrified of it happening again. I made it home, thankfully. I got in my car to go to my mom's surgery the next morning. I almost made it there. I got into the hospital parking lot and while driving up a hill, my car did it again. This time it rolled backwards. Thankfully nobody was behind me! I thank God that both times this happened I have been in a safe area. Needless to say, I have since then talked the dealership into buying the car back (I took a hit on it) and purchased a 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee. Hopefully it doesn't have the same issue.",neg
"I absolutely love my Grand Cherokee!! I purchased my Gray 2017 Grand Cherokee Limited 5.7L in September of 2016, and have put nearly 50k miles on it. My husband and I do a lot of outdoor activities such as running, mountain biking, snowboarding, kayaking, paddle boarding, and sailing. Having a Jeep had always been a dream of mine and my Grand Cherokee lives even further beyond my expectations. The exterior is absolutely gorgeous and the LED Headlights are pretty amazing especially in some tough winter conditions here in the Northeast. I have a THULE Roof Rack System installed and Jeep made it extremely easy with their roof rails to install the system. In addition to that, I tow my boat which is around 4500Ibs and the Jeep can tow it with no issues whatsoever. The interior is really where the Limited shines however. I would go as far as to say that this is a luxury SUV. The leather seating is absolutely amazing with the heating and memory functions.

The Highlander is more quieter got a really high performance ride and has Lexus interior and new looks to it.

"... this post is coming from a former assembly line worker turned electrical engineer for chrsyler ...

1. Fit n Finish - LOOKS great, but a closer eye shows huge misses - tail gate mis-aligned is a big issue.

2. Removed FLIP REAR GLASS on back hatch ... deal breaker for me (others don't care, but i use the UTILITY-ness of that feature every day).

3. No EMBEDDED CROSSBARS ... i have to buy after sales crossbars that look non-integrated? come on jeep ... 50k can't get me an sUv (the U is capital for a reason!)

4. TRANSMISSION ISSUES - no thanks ... this is at least 3 years down-the-road from being ironed out ... i'll let someone else work out these kinks! And please, ONLY purchase the ZF manufactored tranny (V8, Diesel) and not the chrysler sourced ZF one (V6).

5. ELECTRICAL ISSUES - this is probably what scares me the most ... after the 3y36k warranty is up ... a minimum repair bill for electrical (look at all the 2014 posts) is 3k ... THEY REPLACE THE ENTIRE UNITS ... they don't repair anything ... its a total replacement. The same can also be said for the TRANSMISSIONS ... they tried the infamous throttle/body fix ... but in the end, are massively replacing TRANSMISSIONS

6. ENGINE. At least jeep got it somewhat right here ... except for the DIESEL DEF problems (again, google it ... its a pretty big deal and is the reason the 2015 JGC Diesels were held-back until they rectified the problem).

7. GEAR SHIFTER. It was a nice concept, but if you poll all 175,000 2014 JGC owners, i think you'll find they'd prefer the TURN KNOB shifter (or even the legacy shifter) and not the mistake-prone (over shot the selected gear) on the post 2013 JGC's.

8. WARRANTY. I'm normally not a fan of after-market warranties, but if you're hellbent on purchasing any post 2013 JGC, please do get the MAXCARE warranty ... YOU WILL THANK ME WITH FUTURE DOLLARS SAVED!!!",neg
"When the new Cherokee came out I thought, ""Ugly!"" Who'd buy one of those? But, when our beloved 2004 Grand Cherokee was wrecked, we needed to buy another Jeep. We went to our local dealer, bent on buying a new Grand Cherokee but decided to drive a Cherokee Trailhawk with the 3.2L engine and 9 speed automatic transmission. We bought one, looks aside. It's looks grew on us. We had a trip planned to the San Juan Mountains in Colorado, early this summer, in our 2000 Jeep Wrangler but when we discovered it had a differential fluid leak, we took the Trailhawk. We ran some pretty tough trails and it shined. The independent 4wheel suspension has limited articulation but, the electric rear axle locker more than makes up for that. We would say it earned it's ""Trail Rated"" badge. It is economical, powerful, comfortable, and great to drive. It is a ""real"" Jeep! So far it has had ""zero"" issues.",pos

"I have been driving my EX AWD for one month now. 2/3 of my driving is in a heavy stop-and-go SF East Bay traffic and about 1/3 driving on city free-ways to neighbouring towns. I am getting 27.3 mpg combined. On a highway I was getting close to 34-35 mpg. My former car was 2008 Rav4 Sport with 270hp V6 which was basically a rocket. So, I had to do a lot of driving adjustment, since the 1.5L Turbo engine is quite sluggish. But, surprisingly if you put in a sport mode (S), it starts to feel really sporty and handles San Francisco hills with ease and grace. Everything is great, the ride is comfortable, the handling is sharp, mileage is great, the front exterior looks now nice and serious (unlike the previous models wrinkly ss look). Except the rear exterior still looks like a fat & wrinkly ss from 2016 model. Honda, make it smooth and clean as 2017 rav4 or 2017 Kia. I love the front LED daylight running lights. Nice design. Some, I read, want to do away with the moon roof. I disagree. I love it. On a hot summer day, really helps with fresh air. Alloy Wheel design is very cool and artistic. What actually swung my decision to buy honda this time, is its change to digital display. It is beautiful. I used to have it on my old 1992 Mercury Sable, and after that I always cringed at the analog speedometers. Now back to digital. Yey! One issue, which my dealer is fixing now, is the passenger side rear door window - was not properly seated and was giving screeching sounds when rolling down or up. Hope it will get fixed. As far as the slap-on tablet like Entertainment screen - I love it. Works fast, except for the bluetooth - is quirky. Sometimes it cannot find you phone. But sometimes connects immediately. What I like the best - is Pandora. So, do this, before turning your car on, turn on your bluetooth, data and Pandora app on your phone, then turn on your car and select Pandora from Audio Source. It should connect without issues in 90% times. The Android Audio on the other hand is clumsy.",pos

It is just really odd that this isn't included in the EXL.   2. No 12V acc plug in the 2nd row.  My 2005 has one, why not my 2017?   So, I bought a 6ft plug to put in the front and stretch back to the second row.  Again, really odd.  You get one with the RES but not in the base EXL.  Other than that, you will love this car.",pos
"Very nice aesthetically, but lots of recalls and quality issues. The vehicle looks nice inside and out, I like the touch screen and interior. But, after many recalls, a leaky shock, tire replacements, rubber flap in back wheel well constantly comes off, squeaky break pedal, sluggish acceleration at random times, and a constant problem with the vehicle realizing it's in park. Have to move the shifter around for it to work so I can shut the vehicle off. Trading it in for a Ford Edge.",neg
"I was really having a tough time sorting through the countless crossovers out there. I was vacillating between the Ford Explorer, the Nissan Pathfinder and the Infinity QX60. Once the 2014 edition Highlander came on the market, we went for a test-drive and we were sold. It has many improvements over the 2013 model. My favorite is the XLE edition, which allows one to have leather seating without having to add all the extra superfluousness of the ""limited platinum."" You will get amazing value on the XLE. The suspension is really smooth over speed bumps and while doing 80 on the freeway. They did a great job on soundproofing - you'll need to look at the speedometer to realize how fast you're going. The turn radius is pretty tight, especially for such a large car. Braking is outstanding - it is evenly distributed and the distance is short. The low-end torque is decent, once you realize how heavy the car is and that it gets fairly good MPGs, even around town. If you have two young ones, or are about to, I would highly recommend the highlander. They will appreciate the standard second row sun shades and the tri-zone climate control. You even have a ""speak-easy"" function where you can talk to them through their speakers without having to turn around.",pos
"We've owned the car now for 18 months, have put 30,000 miles on it, and are very satisfied overall. It is comfortable, with 1 exception... the seat belt tends to be too tight around the shoulder/neck area. I've  dealt with that by placing a small clip that works like a clothespin on the upper part of the belt (above my shoulder). This prevents the belt from being retracted so tight at the shoulder that it is uncomfortable. The car has nice features and an almost reasonable price compared to other new vehicles in its class... of course, they're all overpriced. Sure would like to see a warranty that matches the claims of reliability, like a 5 year 60,000 mile bumper to bumper. Our warranty will be finished by the time we've owned the car for 2 years because of the mileage. So far we like the car, its features, and the way it handled in snow over 2 winters.",pos

"Can't believe there's NOT a trunk release inside the car! If you don't think you'll miss it, make yourself not use the one in your existing car and see if you miss it. Had a 1995 that even had it in there! Asked dealer (after I bought it) where it was & they said the only model that has it is the touring model. The back-up system is so generic, compared to Ford's. When you back up with theirs, the visual is green (ok), yellow (getting closer) & red (you're right on top); the audio is beep beep (ok), beep, beep, beep (getting closer), & BEEP BEEP BEEP (you're right on top). Honda has no audio and bare bone yellow-no comparison. I'm short and although I try not to hit my knee when I get in, I'm frequently nailing it on the console below & to the L of the steering column, also hit my head a lot on the top. The radio is horrible! the buttons are SO small (& I've got little fingers) I'm constantly hitting the wrong buttons while driving, which throws the thing into la-la land; no matter how much I practice on it, it's a pain & I despise it. Car doesn't do well in high winds for handling. Also sounds like the tires are out of round if it isn't driven every day. The AC and heating system take forever to cool/heat. For a $32K car, I would not buy another. I do, however, like the way the seats lie down in the back...that's what initially attracted me to it plus I've owned Honda's since 1985; still have my 2005 Honda which I gave to my son for high school graduation as he'll be using it to and from college. Feel like giving him the CRV but have payments...if I could do it over, I'd buy another Accord. My husband wanted me to buy a SUV since we already had a new Taurus, the Accord and a pick up.

"My wife wanted to trade our Mercedes GL450 for a new 2016 Pilot Elite. She liked the new design and the features on the Elite cannot be matched on similar vehicles. Her parents have had several Honda's. This was our first. Within the first 1ok miles we had several software recalls. One was for the computer adding miles to the odometer when the car was turned off. Not sure how many miles, but they extended the warranty 12k miles. At 16k miles the transmission started chirping between 3rd and 4th gear. I was told it just needed a firmware reflash. I shared information that suggested otherwise, but the dealer refused to listen. Picked it up the next day and asked if it still chirped. The answer was yes, but that I would have to drive it 40 miles for the system to reteach itself. Drove it 60 and took it back the next day with a louder chirp. Shared several pages from previous owners that stated there was a broken part in the transmission that cross contaminated engine coolant with transmission fluid. Shared that with the dealer. He asked what the resolution was and I told him a new transmission. Turns out I was right. Fast forward to 33k miles. Received a letter from Honda stating that our car now needs a new radiator, all new hoses and O rings and they need to test the engine to make sure it was not damaged. This is all from the original transmission issue. While the car was being repaired, I traded it on a 2016 Lexus GX460. I have been a loyal Toyota/Lexus/Scion user for many years and never should have let my wife talk me into this Honda Pilot. First and last Honda I will ever own! BTW, she loves the new Lexus.",neg

But officially they said that there was no problem with this car. Even when my car stalled on the crossroad two times on the way to children's school, they repeated the same word. It was very risky situation to my family. I really recommend you that you not buy this model. You will regret it.",neg

"**Update as of 3-29-18.  We've now had our Pilot for more than a year and have put about 24,000 miles on it.  We still love this car, and I wouldn't change anything about the review I wrote in early 2017, below.  The transmission hasn't given us a single problem and is still the smoothest shift I've ever experienced in a car.  We've also driven the Pilot in the snow and it performs wonderfully.  We've packed it to the max inside and had car top carriers on it for long trips, have taken it camping, and have used it to shuttle kids around.  Great, reliable SUV that hasn't had a single mechanical glitch or problem.  The bluetooth connectivity is still a little frustrating, but i think we're used to how it works.  It's not very intuitive, and so I'm hoping Honda will have a software update in the future.  For example, figuring out how to switch from one phone to another is nearly impossible.   But that's the only complaint that i still have.  

My wife and I read a lot of reviews prior to purchasing our 2016 Honda Pilot at the end of December, 2016.  There were so many reviews/complaints about the 9-speed transmission that comes standard in the Touring and Elite models, that we were completely scared off of those trim levels, at least initially.  We test drove a Pilot EX model, which has the old 6-speed transmission that we'd had in our older Pilot.  We didn't even want to test drive the Touring model because of the 9-speed transmission.  But then we did.  And we loved it.  And after three months and trips through the mountains, on flat terrain, in city traffic, sitting on highways in traffic, and etc... there is absolutely not a single complaint that we have about the 9-speed transmission.  In fact, i can say with all honesty that it is the smoothest transmission I've ever experienced.  Up-shifting and downshifting is smooth and nearly imperceptible, no matter what the terrain.  The tranny is very smooth and responsive as well.   My brother in law, who knows cars well, drove our car (and knew nothing about the transmission complaints in the reviews), and the first comment he made was that the transmission was incredibly smooth and quiet.  That was totally unprompted (I didn't ask him, ""so what did you think of the transmission"" or anything to that effect).  The Pilot has loads of room for our family of five and the dog, on long trips, and has plenty of power for the mountains.  The Touring model has a number of bells & whistles that we like that just don't come on the EX (including that very quiet, smooth transmission).  One thing that we appreciate the most is the extra sound proofing material in the Touring that doesn't come on the EX model.  It's makes our Pilot noticeable quieter than the cheaper model.  Test drive both in succession and I'm sure you'll agree.  The Honda Sensing takes some getting used to, but it's really handy, especially on long trips.  The braking on the adaptive cruise control can jolt if a car cuts in front of you, but i don't understand why people would complain about that.  Of course the brakes will apply if someone cuts in front of you!   In any event, three months and counting and we love our pilot and haven't had a single issue with it, except for some Bluetooth connectivity weirdness.  When my wife's and my phones are in the car at the same time, we sometimes having trouble connecting to the phone of our choice.  Who know's whether that's more user error than technical glitch.   As for the absence of a radio volume knob - that' s no big deal.  We love having what is in effect an iPod in the dash rather than some old analog knobs.  Great SUV.  We highly recommend.",pos
"Acceleration takes some time getting used to, as it feels different with the 9 speed transmission. Safety features are great, but sensitivity of lane keep assist and auto braking can be overly sensitive. On a hilly road it will sometimes go off when no other cars in sight. Comfort and convenience is superb. I love this vehicle.",pos
"Have been a loyal Honda consumer since 1992 and this is my first Toyota.  Perfect transition from a 2007 Honda Odyssey to the Highlander.  Pros:  Comfort, ride, minimal road noise, interior room, back up camera, blind spot monitoring, audio options, iPhone interface.  Cons:  With 3rd row up, limited cargo space; gas mileage generally 19-20 mpg.   I was so reluctant to give up my van after 16 years' of Honda Odyssey's, but time to move on from the minivans.  Other vehicles we considered were:  Honda Pilot, Acura MDX, Ford Explorer and Infiniti QX60.  Glad we did not spend the extra money for the Acura and Infiniti.",pos
"If you are not into all the new technology that is in cars now you may not be as happy as you thought you would be in a new car. Personally, I enjoyed having things simple and reliable.

"I purchased a CRV Touring in March.  I selected the Honda over the RAV4, for the safety technology.  On the first day of ownership, the ""safety"" systems failed (adaptive cruise control, crash mitigation, and lane departure) while driving down a country road.  What happens, is that the warning lights start to go off, and then all of these systems are shut off until the car is turned off and restarted.  This problem has occurred on country roads, in a major city, at highway speeds and on residential streets.  I have had this failure at least once every week I have owned the CRV.  Some weeks it has failed 5-6 times.  The vehicle was serviced 3 times in the first 7 weeks of ownership, including 2 attempts by a Honda technician, but they were not able to determine the problem.  The technician wants to blame the problem on country roads, even though the failures have happened in city traffic as well.    I am now in mediation with Honda, but they won't replace the car.  They want to buy my car back because they are concerned that another CRV will have the same problem.   In other words, Honda doesn't have confidence that their ""safety"" systems will work in the country.  My dealer has been great, but Honda of America customer service has been terrible.  My mediation case manger doesn't call me back, or follow-up on anything she said she will do.  Other than this issue, I really like the vehicle, but Honda has made it clear to me that they don't value their customers.",neg

Also would you believe it can only play USB drive when only engine is not running. Soon as engine starts, it says cannot read. Very poor quality.",neg
"I found the Pilot brochure confusing. The included options list implies that the Elite has everything the other models have plus more stuff. Not quite true. It does not tell you what is left out, so it's not completely clear what you are getting. Lane Watch is included in lesser models and I expected it should also be on the Elite. It isn't. Some reviews dislike Lane Watch because it takes your eyes away from the road. The Owner's Guide is inadequate. Photos are too small. Honda should include a full size Owner's Manual. Sure, you can go to their website and download the 679 pages and print it yourself but for a $50,000 Elite, you'd think they would give you one. The Guide shows an option that the Elite should have but doesn't. That is Folding Mirrors. This option would help to protect your mirrors from damage by folding them inwards.  Even though the Guide covers it, I did not see it listed as a feature on any of the models. I have yet to use the shifting paddles. I have not found any information yet on how to use them. I'll keep looking. Though not stylish, the Elite is very comfortable and has a lot of cargo space.",pos
"The Subaru Forester is a great car - gets great gas mileage, good acceleration, and lots of cargo space.  BUT it has very unsafe handling capacity on windy days.

I've also had terrible problems with the Bluetooth.  Very poor sound quality during phone calls.  And each time I got a new cell phone, the Bluetooth would stop automatically connecting to the phone once I paired the new phone with the Bluetooth device.  I got so frustrated with the unsafe driving conditions on windy days and the malfunctioning Bluetooth that I used the car as a trade in and got a new Rav4.

First off they didn't tell you at the dealership that the vehicle has a special traction control system that automatically works when engaged and almost cost me three accidents because it slams on the brakes then the drivers view on the dashboard goes all nuts. The lights are very distracting on the dashboard and to me can not be turned off. Then the radio setup for blue tooth and radio stations sucks! First off they only give you 10 presets for your Sirius radio which is not good. Especially if you want to hear other things. Functionality of this radio is system is horrible and not very user friendly. Finally the worst thing about this vehicle is the gas consumption. I feel like I'm only 200 miles a week but I had to fill the truck up three times. I'm not impressed if it wasn't for my wife I would never buy this vehicle!

It's been a couple of years now and I still feel the same disappointed. I'm finally giving up and going back to Toyotas. I bought the 2015 CRV in October of 2014. It was the only one on the dealer's lot. I didn't notice the vibration when I test drove the car but I certainly experienced it within the first week. I've taken the car back at the least 10 times for either the vibration or the car shutting off for no reason. I received little to no help from the dealership or Honda's Headquarters. I also asked for them to either buy back or allow me to swap for something else. I was denied any further assistance and met with sarcasm.  I'm 100% disappointed.,neg

"Sincerely disappointed in the performance of my 2015 Jeep Cherokee Limited V6 engine. I purchased the car brand new in July 2015 and immediately experienced problems with a rattling/squeaking panorama sunroof and rusting of the paint on the hood of the brand new car. Repairs were made on both by a local Chrysler/Jeep/Dodge service station, where an employee informed me ""the sunroof rattled because all Jeep parts (with the exception of the Jeep Grand Cherokee ones) are made with the cheapest parts they can get, and that's why they rattle."" This should have been a warning flag because this conversation occurred only 5 weeks after ownership. Time went on and the rattling/squeaking sunroof came back, the speakers rattled a low volumes (again an indication of poorly manufactured parts) and I starting experiencing new problems where the check engine light would come on and spontaneously go off, and issues with the fuel gauge. The fuel gauge would only ever fill to 3/4 and would have huge swings while driving (one minute have 1/4 tank, the next 3/4). To fix said problems, the local service department would have the car for 6 days (of which I was given a loaner car). Chrysler parts headquarters is located only on the west coast and we were informed,  ""Chrysler rules do not allow for overnight shipping of each part"" thus, adding to the delay. To add to my frustration, on numerous occasions when I picked the car up, noticeable collateral damage from the repairs would occur, including a broken rearview mirror, a torn passenger leather seat cover and door trim, and other various dirt and scuff marks of which I would yet again have to return to the service station to have addressed. I am coming up on 36,000 miles, the end of the manufacturer's warranty, just under two years of ownership (yet another flaw that Chrysler puts so little faith in their cars). I was greatly encouraged by the local service department to purchase the $1,500 extended warranty because in their words ""the radio, which controls almost everything electronic in the car, will be the next to go (cost of $1,400 to fix)."" In summary, although I was attracted to the interior design and look of the car, it is built with poor-quality parts that rattle and break down, and I made over thirty trips (I counted all service records) to the local service station for repairs and collateral damage fixes in just under two years. Prospective buyers of this car, I recommend do not purchasing this car and consider a certified pre-owned higher quality car with a long-term warranty.",neg

"I have owned my 2016 Pilot EX-L with Honda Sensing technology for over 6 months now and driven 6500 miles. We wanted a comfortable, reliable and perhaps foremost a safe car for a family of 4. When testdriving it I fell in love with the smooth, solid and quiet drive the Pilot offered. It felt like a really well put together car with excellent driving dynamics and performance. The Sensing option captured my imagination and have not regretted paying the extra $ 1000 or so for this amazing technology. The adaptive cruise control and lane keep assist really make driving on the interstate and other highways effortless. I was initially somewhat sceptical but after having figured out it's features and limitations I now religiously use it every time. The computer takes over the routine small adjustments of the steering wheel required to keep in the middle of the lane. It also adapts to traffic speed in front of me with a distance selector function up to the upper speed limit I set. I have read criticisms about the abrupt reactions in certain driving situations, however this can be eliminated with preemptive driving and has not bothered me at all. It might not be the best in heavy traffic though. On the other hand it is surprising how these two functions of the sensing technology has reduced fatigue I usually got on longer drives before I started using them. The road departure and collision mitigation system are also great features and peace of mind and who knows when they might in fact become a saving grace. I can very easily imagine that it can indeed avoid a collision due to brief inattention for example. The car does accelerate briskly, braking power could be a little better. It turns around in a surprisingly small radius considering the size of this car. The passenger side rear view mirror camera is also a great safety feature, which took a while to get used to, but now it's easy and makes changing lanes a lot safer for sure. The leather interior is great, very spacious with adjustable legroom even in the second row, with easy to fold second row seats with a touch of a button. Also reasonable third row seats and legroom competing with minivan third rows. We haven't really used the 3rd row and the seats are currently folded for cargo space. The climate control system is really efficient and second row is also very well climatized with separate controls and multiple vents. A feature we love is starting the engine from a distance using the remote key, which helps cool the car down quicker when boarding on sunny days. I cannot fault this car in any way. So far so good and all members of the family absolutely love it.",pos

"I test drove several cars and a few trucks including the CRV, Rav4, Tacoma, and Escape. I loved the Forester Premium XT Turbo and ordered one in early January. I love the minor changes including the boxier front end. I have only been driving it for a few weeks but I am more than pleased. I wasn't looking for mind blowing mileage since I ordered the turbo, and am happy averaging 25 MPH with a mixture of city/highway driving. On a recent 400 mile trip I averaged 28 MPG. The comfort is very good and the visibility is outstanding. Subaru has vastly improved the quietness of this vehicle. The leg room is great, even in the backseat. My 5' 10"" 250 pound frame fits this SUV very comfortably, and the vehicle is easy to get in & out of.

Worst Honda Ever Made,neg
First the windows sound that looks like a air leak. The engine and transmission sound awful for a new car. You can hear all the noise as the vehicle change gears. My dashboard lights go intermittent from time to time. The breaks cry noisy . When you are in cruise control the vehicle calculates the front vehicle speed and slow you down. If the front vehicle change line the Toyota accelerates suddenly but if the front vehicle was close to another the speed safety control delay too much to kick in again making the vehicle unsafe. The 4cyl are a lot different from the 6 cyl. They looks the same but they are not.I can reflect more problems but at this point i feel sorry for myself to buy this peace of bran new jub k..,neg
"This is my second Forester. Last one was an '03. The 2017 should fit most people's needs, but is undriveable for me. Biggest complaint is the front headrests. I am 5'10"" and the headrest pushes my head forward and down. I can't drive it for more than a few minutes without hurting myself. Blind spot at passenger side rear when looking at it from driver's seat is big, and made more so by body design: right rear window sweeps up towards tailgate, so body design gives you an idea that there's a car there when there isn't. You have to really look, not glance, to check that blind spot. I like the manual transmission, but think there should be some more spacing between the gears. I'm constantly shifting from 2nd to 5th (skipping 3rd) or 3rd to 6th (skipping 4th) because the selections are tightly spaced. As I get used to it, that should change. Cabin noise is about normal for a low-20s priced car. You're not going to get a Caddie. Fit, finish, steering, and handling,  are good for a car in its price range. Acceleration is good. Subaru has never made seats for long drives for most people, and I knew that when buying the car (my problem is the headrest, not the seat). I've had the car for 6 weeks now. Most of my driving has been city driving, so mileage is low and probably unfair at first glance.

Update for the comment that asked about adjusting the headrest: Yes, both I and the dealer tried different headrest positions; no luck. My head gets pushed forward and down. I'm going to have to spring for an interior customizer to modify the head rests. Cost unknown. Head rests in old '03 were fine.

Update on review: Nothing has changed. Gas mileage is lower than expected, but not by much, and given my driving habits and city driving, I can't complain too much about that. Headrests are miserable and it cost $150 to have one headrest modified so I could stand to drive it for more three minutes.  Blind spot at passenger side rear is large.

Don't buy it. Subaru can design a Forester with a much smaller blind spot, and headrests that don't pitch one's head forward. When Subaru does that, fine.",neg
"I bought the 2015 Cherokee Trailhawk as I frequently drive on dirt roads to visit clients on the reservation. The Trailhawk is the best vehicle in the mud that I have ever owned. I have owned an Explorer, Honda CRV and Toyota 4 Runner. This beats them all completely and have yet to get stuck. The transmission over-revs in the Sport transmission setting; I do not use that function now. The mileage is more than acceptable at an over-all 25.4 MPG. This is a great vehicle, I recently drove to Washington state and averaged 27.2 on the highway. This is the best vehicle that I have ever owned.",pos
"I really like the design of the 2017 Honda pilot.   It's attractive on the outside,  comfortable on the inside.   A few concerns though.  The rear seats could be a little more comfortable but at least they are not used every day.   It also seems like the heat takes a while to really kick in which was not what I was expecting for a brand-new vehicle but perhaps because it's a large space it takes a while.   Also the Bluetooth has not consistently worked.   Overall a five star car though, great in snow and ice and very good gas mileage for this type of vehicle.",pos
"Test the shifting lever which is electronic, when shifting from park to drive 90% of the time if goes to ""N"". When shifting from ""D to ""P"" it will stop at ""R"" and if you are not careful and double check the shifter and try to turn the motor off prior to getting out the car will start moving backwards.  The dealer tells me they all operate this way.  I have owned many Jeep Cherokee over the years and this will be the last.  Not good at all. 

Correction this is a 2015 model

"I have a new 2016 Jeep Cherokee Latitude with 1200 miles on it. I noticed a noise coming from my engine at a traffic light and I thought it was the car behind me but when I turned the radio down I discovered it was coming from my new Jeep. When you turn the radio down you can here a ticking sound which sounds like a helicopter propeller. Very Annoying for a Brand new Vehicle. I went to the dealership and let the service manager drive it with me and he heard the same noise. Then he asked the mechanic to go with me and he heard the same noise. I had taken it back to the dealership to have them diagnose and they said that it was a Purge Solenoid Valve and they replaced it. But when they called me to pick it up they said that it was still making the noise and probably will stay that way until Jeep comes out with a replacement part or a recall. Really!!! You pay $30,000 for a new Jeep and you get this kind of noise. I have owned a lot of other Vehicles over the years and the Engines have always been quiet with the radio turned down and you did not even know they were running. The Engineers at Jeep need to take a look at this because it is unacceptable in my book and not up to standards. Unless someone likes listening to this noise I guess you will be ok with it. But when you test drive I would listen for this noise before you buy. The Dealer started more of the Jeeps on the lot and they all made this noise and he told me this is the way Jeep has made them. I did call the Jeep Service Center and all they could tell me is that they would make documentation of it. We all know where that is going! Maybe the CEO of Jeep should get in the car with me for a test drive and listen to the noise and see if he likes listening to it. You think they would have discovered this before they came off of the assembly line.

"On February 23, 2018, my car which has 5500 miles on it, started making a horrible noise and began losing power while on the highway.  The noise continued throughout the weekend.  We made an appointment with dealership immediately.  Honda Corporate and the Service Manager determined through video chats and conference calls that the cams were destroyed in my engine.  They believe this had to do with fuel and oil mixing and getting into the engine.  
Honda Corporate (800-999-1009) requested that dealership replace the Head of the Engine.  They have no fix for the problem with the fuel and oil mixing and destroying the engine.  The Service Manager said because the government is involved due to emissions, this issue will be continuing, and at this time there is no fix.  He also stated that Corporate informed him this was a Regional issue due to our climate, and they are currently trying to figure out a software fix for the problem.  No resolution at this point.  Corporate further stated that they are seeing this issue when the temperature is between 10 and 30 degrees.  I was offered a 100,000 extended warranty and recommended that I go to the dealer every 500 miles to get an oil change to see if fuel is mixing with the oil.  Shocked at the lack of resolution, I asked the Service Manager if Honda Corporate was comfortable giving me my car back after the cams were replaced with no resolution, and he said Yes.  I do not believe this is ethical at all for Honda to not have a fix to an engine problem that could endanger myself and/or my family.  I am not comfortable taking this car back knowing that the engine could be “scorched” again while driving to a destination.  It is neither safe nor prudent to drive a vehicle that has such engine problems considering it has less than 6000 miles.  This is a BRAND NEW Car!  On day 19 with no car and not final resolution in sight.  I am required to pick up my car when the head is replaced.  PLEASE DO NOT purchase the 2017/2017 CRV EX 1.5 turbo models.  There is no fix to the oil/gas problem!!!",neg

"The car is not made efficiently! I have 7,000 miles on the car today. I took the car back to the dealer for noise and vibration. I was told that they replaced the rear Heat shield and that the car was quiet. The car still vibrates at 1200 or less RPM. When I accelerate the noise of vibration is consistent until reaching above 1200 RPM and it runs with plenty of get up but then when descending down a slope the car vibrates and the noise is loud. I have yet to feel comfortable in the car after adjusting the driver seat up and down tilted forward or backward. It simply is not comfortable. There is road noise as well in the cab of the car! It's like driving with the windows open which is not advisable since I live in central Pennsylvania and the temperature is 32 or less. I am totally disheartened by the purchase of this vehicle. I am frustrated every time I have to drive this car. I am totally disappointed and feel cheated in pursuing a new car that I could retire with and not have these concerns and issues. I would not recommend to anyone the purchase of this car and this is my second Honda.  Bob Henry",neg
my scores say it all. This is a well-engineered car engineered with the driver in mind. It consistently delights me.,pos
"Absolutely love this pilot.  Very comfortable, excellent safety features, stylish.  I went from an Audi to my Honda Pilot and just LOVE it.  It's the 2016 model so not boxy and large like it used to be (which I liked as well).  I still get it confused with the Mercedes SUV's that are in the parking lot as well as the BMW SUV's.  I am surprised on the gas mileage we are getting with our Pilot - averaging 25-28 mph - which is more than we were getting with our Audi A4.  This Pilot is everyone in our family's favorite!",pos
"I've been impressed so far by my FWD 2017 Highlander XLE. It is comfortable, spacious, gets reasonable gas mileage for a big car, and I love the active safety features and how well laid out the controls are. It is also very smooth and quiet on the highway and is a reasonable size for my garage and parking lots while still fitting lots of stuff. Note that I use it as a two row vehichle. The third row is really more for small kids on trips and adults at no more than short distances and when in use the cargo space goes from great to limited. I really like the blind spot monitoring. Getting about 27.5 mpg on highway and 25 overall so far. One thing I'm not a fan of is the throttle response. Transmission is programmed for economy so the car feels slower than it is and you really have to hit the gas to feel the power. If you floor it you'll find the car really moves quickly but otherwise it feels lethargic. Using the power setting improves this. The controls are very good on the car.",pos
"I bought a 2015 Honda CRV EX and did the test drive at the dealer, did not have vibration problem, but when I was on the way to the dealer to get the registration, the car vibrated when it stopped at the traffic lights (brake on D). I told the dealer about it, they said Honda is aware of the issue and is trying to find a solution. I was very disappointed with the brand new car. ",neg
"Overall, l love the car. The handling, the active driving safety features, the gas mileage, the ride, ...   Would be nice if there are more pocket/compartment for storage. And the car come with so many control/info features, it would take sometime to get to know and use.",pos
"I bought my CRV in May after doing a lot of research.  Unfortunately, I did not come across the information regarding the CRV vibrating when the car is idle.  Not only do I experience this issue with my car, but the vibration is actually getting worse, and it is very uncomfortable.  Additionally, my brand new car also has a very loud rattle in the dashboard area.  I will be bringing my car into the local Honda dealership to see how these problems can be resolved.  Even if these issues are resolved, I predict that I will never buy another Honda vehicle.  In summary, don't let the attractive aspects of this car (safety features, overall design) fool you, because the problems that go along with this car are not worth the price.",neg
"Proud new owners of a 2017 Honda Pilot Touring. We got a GREAT deal on this vehicle because they had a bunch of 2018s on the lot and wanted to clear out the few 2017s that were left. Brand new for thousands less? Yes please! We traded in a 2012 Ford Explorer Limited. I liked my Explorer ... I LOVE my Honda. The 9 speed transmission doesn't bother me like it bothers some other reviewers; and I actually really like the side view camera. I originally had my heart set on a Toyota Highlander, but when we actually drove one I was very underwhelmed by it. Driving the Highlander I thought ""meh. It's nice, but I don't HAVE to have it."" It felt small inside, the third row was tiny, and it just didn't wow me like I thought it would. On a whim we decided to stop at the local Honda dealership on our way home just to take a look at the Pilots and maybe test drive one. I ended up falling in love with it as soon as I sat inside and we bought it that afternoon. It handles exceptionally well in snow and ice, even on our steep and often cumbersome driveway. I love the adaptive cruise, and I don't find the forward collision warning system overly sensitive as some other reviews have suggested. The Pilot is much roomier inside than both my Explorer and the Highlander we drove. I thought I wanted the Elite to get the middle row captain's chairs but then our salesman showed me the one-touch sliding seats and that sealed the deal. Our biggest issue was third row accessibility and the one-touch seat makes that so easy without sacrificing a seat. It even works with a car seat in place. Driving it is a dream; it feels very solid and sturdy. It corners very well and feels more like a car to me than a three row SUV. I love that it sits up a bit higher; this makes visibility better and also makes it handle better in the snow than my Explorer did. I was a loyal Honda and Acura owner for years before buying a Ford, and now that I am back in a Honda I wonder why I ever left. We are very happy with our choice and plan to keep this vehicle for many years!",pos

The sun roof did not work the day I bought it, it has been back at the dealership twice now and they cannot fix the problem.  They have had my car now for 6 days.  I just called the dealership Manager and told him I want a new car so he put in a claim for me.  We'll see what happens from here.",neg

"We have owned ours for 2.5 years and have put 17,000 miles on the clock. Its reliable - no problems at all so far, everything still works. We average about 300 plus miles on a tank - city/highway combined. The features that truly stand out - amazing visibility from the driver seat, lots of headroom, love the standard rear view camera. Comfortable ride but with a fair amount of road noise but not terrible. Rear seat room adequate for car seats however front seats cannot be pushed all the way back if you are tall and have a rear facing car seat behind you. Adequate rear storage space although cheap plastic used over wheel arches - broke when I pushed in a stroller. Overall we are very happy with this purchase and plan to keep for at least 5-7 years.",pos
"Do your research - search 2015 CRV vibration problems!  It is terrible!  When you are in drive and stopped in traffic or at a stoplight, the front seats vibrate so badly it is terrible.  This is an issue Honda knows about and yet they keep selling these.  The dealers ""seem"" to be in the dark because they don't want you to know.  Do yourself a favor and if you still want one of these cars, take it on a good long test drive so it warms up.  This starts once it is warm because the rpms drop so low.  I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.",neg
"I'm a car owner that keeps my cars for years so when it was time to start shopping for my next car my first consideration was a car with a reputation for longevity, ease of ownership and quality. I'd honestly never thought of Toyota because it's so soccer mom-ish but I began to love the new styling every time I saw the new body style. I had heard that buying a Toyota would keep me in the car for at least 5 years headache free.
I've got almost 5000 miles on the car now and loved every minute I've spent in the car! My few less than positive comments follow:

1. The braking is almost too soft. I find myself pressing on the brake and startled when I'm coming too close to the car in front of me and then quickly pressing much harder to actually stop the car. I've done this several times now and can see it's a problem in the event I have to react to split second stopping. I feel like I need to take it to a empty parking lot and practice emergency stops so I can adjust to the really soft brake pedal.
2. I find the car has that lag when you stomp on the gas to accelerate into traffic from the on ramp. It almost feels like it LOSES energy when I step on the pedal then doesn't follow up with rapid acceleration but slogs into traffic which is frustrating. I don't know about torque and rpms and such but a V6 should have more power than this at a low speed to rapid acceleration, I thought.

I live in Colorado. When driving into the mountains it has plenty of power to climb the hills and the transmission is smooth and perfectly silent. I love the ability to take it out of auto D and switch the gears to slow my descent which is a necessity here.

I bought it in May so hope that this car is solid on snowy roads, that's why I went back into an SUV from a sedan. Last winter, I'd rent a AWD/4WD when driving to the mountains because I had a FWD sedan so when I needed a winter car I'd rent one. So, I compared the Nissan Pathfinder, the Buick Enclave and the Ford Explorer in true winter conditions. The Buick is a tank and grippy. I actually relaxed during a tricky winter drive in the Buick. Next in line was the Explorer which has the control to switch to ""snow"" and when I put that into play, it felt solid and reliable on slick, snow packed roads but still had a ""tinny"" feel, the opposite of a tank. The Nissan would hit a patch of snow pack and slide sideways making for a sickening experience among other really questionable build issues that convinced me this car is a non starter. Bottom line, I hope my Highlander feels solid like the Buick this winter.

The Buick has a pretty interior, lots of accent lighting and finishes in the cabin to make you feel like you're in a very expensive high end vehicle. The Highlander has a utilitarian interior cabin with just a few details to make it feel more like a car than a truck but it stills looks utilitarian. The center compartment is huge and I find I access it a lot like my purse...the tray has the things I need daily, and the ""bottomless"" part catches all the stuff that I leave in the car so I reach deep into it and rake through stuff to find what I'm looking for. It literally can conceal a large purse or your laptop case (and probably an airline carry on!) so it's useful for concealing things left in the car.

The sound system is just adequate, the range of sound is in the middle range and a narrow range at that, just adequate. 

The road noise is noticeable but acceptable.

The doors have a hollow sound when you shut them which is surprising.

The bluetooth speaker system tied to my phone is a muffled sound and coupled with road noise, it's underwhelming.

I chose the Highlander over the Buick because I felt like the Highlander is going to take me much further down the road with fewer repair/maintenance headaches but it was a close call between the two. The Toyota care program tilted my decision in it's favor. I'm all for someone else taking care of and paying for the regular maintenance for the first two years.

In town driving on mostly 35mph streets gets around 22; getting into stop and go drive time on interstate roads gets 24 and all out interstate driving at 75mph gets over 30. This is almost the same as my little 4cyl FWD sedan!

Bottom line, I'm hoping the car doesn't disappoint in true winter driving and I'm prepared to switch to winter tires to get the performance I need but I hope I don't have to spend the money and the time to switch tires twice a year. Everything else I'm overall content with and happy with my purchase.",pos
"I purchased a Honda CRV 2017 Touring  January 2017 and I noticed the long tube that connects to both muffler is rusting and molding. I went back to my dealer Paragon Honda in Queens , NY and I was told that it's a manufacturer problem and that is how is made. I am furious because I paid 38,000.00 for my vehicle and they told me there is nothing I can do. I guess I am going to present this case to my lawyer and see what I can do .",neg
"The good:  Safety features, interior space / cargo volume, engine power
The bad:  Infotainment is slow and buggy, floaty handling.
The ugly:  Honda quality (or lack there of).  Jerky 9 speed transmission that ""surges"" in certain down hill driving conditions - Safety issue!  The vehicle has a highway vibration issue that the dealer can't figure out.  Honda could care lees and claims it's ""normal"". Paint quality - my dealer bought back the first one we purchased from them because of 30+ ""spots"" in the clear coat.  Honda was going to pay to have 75% of the vehicle repainted, but we refused.   The first vehicle didn't have the vibration problem and still Honda tells us they all do it, so it's a ""normal characteristic of the vehicle.""  I'm guessing it's VCM related, but It's hard to say when Honda wont help.  We had ""normal"" vibration issues on both a 2009 and 2012 and both ended up requiring engine work at under 70k miles.

"I'm pushing 70 and have owned many, many vehicles in my life.  I have another SUV and a nice sports car, but I wanted something for snowy days that didn't cost much to own and operate and was reliable.  I have about 20k miles on this 2016 now and am very happy with the purchase.  It was the best value available.   I was a little concerned about the oil burning issues of the previous three years, but this one doesn't use a drop of oil.  Likewise, I didn't know what to expect from the CVT, but it is just fine.  It just doesn't sound like other cars when accelerating.  Also, when we first test drove the vehicle, I thought the seats were too bouncy, but I've come to like them, and I find they are very comfortable on long trips.  The back has plenty of cargo space and the windows are like driving around in a greenhouse.  The visibility is something you need to experience to know what you are missing in other vehicles.  You will need to get them tinted, especially if you live in a sunny location.  There are just a very few things I don't care for or that could be improved.  The sheet metal is really thin, but so were all of the competitors.  The paint shows a few chips, but the vehicle is white and the touch up paint blends in well.  I wish the doors would automatically lock.  I can't figure out why the Subaru engineers don't do this.  It wouldn't cost a thing and it would improve safety.  The accelerator is a little sensitive.  I suspect the engineers wanted to give the illusion of being peppy.  It is not needed.  The radio is OK, but I don't use any of the tech.  Lastly, I don't care for the Subaru dog commercials.  I know they sell cars, but I wish they would just focus on letting people know what a good value these vehicles are.  I intend to keep this one a long time, so I installed some of the plastic door protectors and a rear bumper guard.  The only other extras this vehicle has are alloy wheels and the roof rack.  The vehicle is just perfect for us.",pos

"I recently bought my fourth Grand Cherokee (2018 Summit) since 2014, and I still own the third (2017 Trailhawk). I have had to deal with a few recall issues, but have not had any reliability issues. I will admit the first two had less than 40,000 miles each when traded-in. I was one who swore they would never own a Chrysler product (mostly because of the reputation of being unreliable), but loved the look of the 2014 Grand Cherokee so decided to test drive one. I was most impressed with the comfortable, quiet ride and great driving dynamics. Im sure there are people who have had serious problems with their Grand Cherokees, but I think anyone who categorically rules out owning a Grand Cherokee because of a perceived lack of reliability is doing themselves a great disservice. The late model (WK2) Grand Cherokee is a fantastic vehicle with great comfort and good fuel economy. I am more impressed every time I drive one after driving something else.",pos
"Purchased December 2014. The front end, in my opinion is ugly, but the vehicle was so comfortable to sit in and came with a very nice interior (TrailHawk with GPS, Leather etc for a good price) Unfortunately my first transmission completely failed at just around 5K miles, with very little warning. Around 6k miles I was feeling the second transmission continuing to have periodic problems with jumping or slamming into the low gears when slowing down or stopping. Also hesitating to take off occasionally. The local dealer and the corporate customer service has been absolutely horrible and unable to assist. Also tried sport mode and it's not good. All I can see is that it causes the vehicle to run at excessively high RPMs before shifting and at low gears will not upshift normally causing the transmission to strain and heat up significantly. Overall, the exterior is nice but I dislike the front end shape. The interior and technology is great, but due to the ongoing transmission issues (which I've learned is common) these Jeeps are unreliable and the company unwilling to do anything.",neg

The vehicle rides a little too noisy. It lacks power. But is very annoying because the ac sends a stale odor into the cabin after sitting for a few hours. Honda has not been able to fix and tells me to turn the ac off. That's not acceptable. This is our 5th Honda. No major issues before. They all have lacked power and had several squeaks. It usually took me a few months to fix the squeaks... then ok.,neg

"Alright guys, I am not one to sugar coat my opinions on vehicles, I'm coming out of a 2006 Pontiac Torrent (wrote a review for that no better than scrap metal vehicle!) let me address the controls first: those that get new vehicles frequently and are up on the newest and hottest in vehicle entertainment systems may find Subaru's some what simplistic design lacking, I have always upgraded my vehicles with touch screen radios etc and the transition wasn't bad coming in to the forester. My advice is to sit and play with the controls for awhile if you're having trouble, once you figure it out I think you will appreciate how easy it is to use while driving. The controls on the wheel did intimidate me for a minute but having the accessibility at my fingertips is nice! And when it comes to setting the clock (saw some frustration on a couple reviews) it's not really that difficult, again, play with your controls while you're sitting in park and you'll figure it out. The manual did suck when explaining these features so I do not recommend trying to figure it out with that. Interior materials: I've seen a few complaints about the interior feeling cheap due to the use of hard plastic materials, to me this makes perfect sense. I am new to the Subaru family but plastic is long lasting and easy to clean, when thinking about Subaru and how their consumers love the off road capabilities it makes sense as to why they used the materials they did. This is not an Audi or a Mercedes, they pretty much think you're going to be rough with it and planned ahead with the materials used. The seats are a bit firm, but they're also new and firmness can be adjusted! I recommend the all weather package if you live anywhere that gets cold, heated seats are an awesome option and since I prefer cloth, not many companies cater to that desire. I saw some mild dissapointment when it comes to the placement of the USB and AUX ports, as I said previously, I usually install new radios on my vehicles so the ports are on the radio, Subaru places theirs in the center console and I actually LOVE that placement as you don't have wires coming out of the front of the vehicle getting tangled in the shifter etc, there are 2 cut outs for the wires so you can safely close the arm rest and still have your phone plugged in. I absolutely love that, but personal preference I suppose. Some reviewers mentioned the fact that the doors do not lock when you put the vehicle in drive, this is not an issue for me as I do not have children and typically only have people over 21 in my vehicle, they should know at that age not to open the doors while the vehicle is in motion but I can see how that could become a mild annoyance to those that have to remember to lock the vehicle every time they drive it so just make note of that if you have children. I have only had this vehicle 24 hours so I cannot comment on reliability, once I've broken it in I will update on that. My package included the first 2 years of scheduled maintenance, which I would recommend as they take synthetic oil and I am told the air filters can also become extremely costly. If you can swing it in your deal, try to get this included. The CVT transmission did take about 10 minutes to get used to and when the vehicle cold starts it is a bit noisey for a vehicle that has a hundred miles on it. Not a deal breaker though. I'm not a big fan of the Aha radio that comes installed on the radio, it seems to take too long to load but then again, I have only played with it once so that opinion may change. So far it drives over potholes, bumps, and other annoying road obstacles like cream cheese on a bagle. I opted to not get the eye sight technology as I thought it may become annoying, the back up camera and (huge) moon roof that come standard are both nice surprises. I'm still figuring out little quirks and haven't yet had the chance to test it in bad weather conditions (although it's snowing now!) and I do plan to take it in to some mild off road conditions so these are all things I will review later in time. I opted for a lease and plan to switch it once my credit is built up a bit, but so far, I do not see any major complaints in the foreseeable future. They also have roadside assistance at no cost to you, which is also a nice feature! Can't wait to update for you guys!",pos
"Its a beautiful, well designed car with lots of features more expensive cars have and its been perfect for 3 years (bought 2014 Altitude new) and once the warranty runs out at 3 years the issues start. Dealership wants a fortune and a lot of time to fix so just not a long term purchase. I wish I would have just leased it and turned it in after 3 years for a new one.

Pilot can be bought with the navigation system only in the top trim models and these also have the 9-speed transmission. I took a test drive on the freeway and when accelerating onto the freeway to merge safely with traffic I floored the accelerator pedal and then waited a full 4 seconds before the transmission downshifted and the car computer fed more fuel to the engine and the car started to accelerate. When I simulated a passing situation by moving into the left lane and flooring the accelerator pedal the same thing happened. No response at all for 4 seconds and then finally the car started to accelerate. The published 0-60 MPH times with the Pilot are not at all accurate with the 9-speed transmission. Add 4 seconds to the time and you will appreciate why I do not consider the Pilot safe to drive on the highway. The other con for me was the feel of the electronic steering where there was no feedback and it was further complicated by the odd profile of the steering wheel that is rectangular rather than round. The storage space is exceptional with the Pilot and the navigation system that uses Garmin technology like that found in the Garmin 760 is outstanding and the best of any SUV at this time. I would only buy one of the two trim levels that have the 6-speed transmission and based on that I decided to instead buy a 2018 Chevy Traverse.,neg

"We compared this to the new Honda Pilot before buying.   The Pilot really shined from the 2nd row back where it has more room in the 3rd row and storage space behind.  The Highlander also had similar acceleration and handling.   One of the deciding factors was how horrible the new Pilot looks.   Let me put it this way  if a Civic and an Odyssey had a child it would be the Honda Pilot.   On the other hand, if a Camry and a 4 Runner had a child it would be a Highlander.   The active safety features can be a little overwhelming at first, but they all have sensitivity adjustments.   It really pays to sit and read the manual on this car as there are a ton of customization features from the loudness of the beep when you lock the door to the color of the buttons on the stereo.     I'm amazed by the quietness and smooth ride of this SUV.   The steering is effortless, but there isn't enough feedback.  It feels too much like a computer controller.

Also, read the warranty carefully when you buy/lease a new vehicle as Chrysler does not include a rental for any warranty repair work!  I really lucked out that the dealership provided me with a loaner or I would have been without a car for 3 weeks!  And the support from Jeep/Chrysler is a joke.

"Honk the horn, if you have no problem with the horn (as it is sized for a small moped) then look at what is involved in jump-starting this vehicle.

"Before buying a car, especially in this price range, a little research goes a long way. My choice was between the Toyota Highlander and the Honda Pilot, both top of the line models. The Pilot had an edge because I already own one. After test driving both vehicles at least a couple of times, I found that the safety features on the Toyota Highlander were better than those on the Honda Pilot. With the Pilot, I found that I had to purchase features such as a video system in order to get the lane shift feature I really wanted. I love the Highlander, which surprised me since I've really enjoyed my 2012 Pilot. The Highlander rides like a luxury vehicle. In comparing both 2018 models, the Highlander was a more luxurious, comfortable, feature laden car. ",pos

"I needed an SUV to cart around my three children and all of their friends but didn't want a minivan. The Toyota Highlander is the perfect vehicle for us. I have the AWD version so that gas mileage isn't amazing but it is good and the handling in adverse weather conditions is excellent. I got a great deal on the vehicle at $34,000 and they seem to maintain their value. A big deciding factor for me is the reliability of the car. I wanted a vehicle that I won't constantly have to be bringing to the shop to fix ""wear and tear"" items. I don't have the time or energy to waste on going back and forth to the mechanic. When considering this vehicle I talked to my mechanic (that I love and trust) and he said that if everyone owned Toyotas, he'd be out of a job. He stated that Toyotas regularly come into the shop and leave with only scheduled maintenance. The exterior styling could have been more unique for my tastes but it is classy and pretty sleek so I'll take it. The interior even at the LE Plus trim level is excellent. It is stain resistant cloth through the middle of the seats but trimmed with synthetic leather. After a month of driving it, my kids haven't managed to stain anything yet. I also love that the middle seats slide forward (without having to remove the booster seats) to access the rear seats. You can also slide the middle seats forward or backward in many different positions to allow for more or less leg room in the third row. Having 8 seats is such a blessing. I find that I often keep only two seats up in the third row to give myself plenty of cargo space. I am looking forward to driving this car for many years to come.",pos
"If one of the features you are looking to buy the car for is the connectivity and safety of Apple CarPlay, look elsewhere. Our 2017 CR-V is 7 months old and has 5,000 miles on it and we have had multiple issues daily with the Apple CarPlay feature. Many times it will not show up on the display at all that a phone is connected even when plugged in. The dealership said it was because we had the phone connected to the vehicle via bluetooth and CarPlay and we were using a low end cable (we weren't) and we weren't plugging the phone in before the vehicle was started. I expected the next thing to be that we needed to hold our breath, keep one foot outside the vehicle when starting, and touch your tongue to your nose in order to make this feature work. We bought the top of the line CR-V - AWD, Touring, nearly every feature you could get, the only problem is that they don't work which is pretty disapointing from a brand like Honda and after spending $35K for the vehicle. We're being told that ""Apple updates the phones faster than we can update the vehicle software, but we know this is an issue"", however you aren't doing anything about it. In addition to the CarPlay issues we have had several other electrical issues with sensors, particularly the reverse/back up sensors (which have to be installed at the dealership and are not a factory option) not being loud enough to be heard with the radio at a reasonable volume (10-12). We have also had issues with the blind spot sensor on the driver's side indicating that there is a vehicle there when there is not a vehicle there. Does that mean that sometimes when there is a vehicle there it isn't working? We have also had issues adjusting the brightness of the driver display (all digital). Sometimes it will allow you to lower the brightness, sometimes turning the adjustment/trip knob does absolutely nothing. Lastly, when using navigation through CarPlay the volume does not go up high enough to be heard on the highway, and the volume of the radio does not lower to allow the turn by turn navigation instructions to be heard over the radio. While the vehicle does start every morning it is very concerning to have all of these electrical issues wtih a push button start vehicle. There are body pannel/trim fit issues on the vehicle that we didn't notice until we brough it home, its feeling more and more like we bought a lemon. We're currently considering trading the vehicle for something with functional technology or pursuing the Lemon Law here in Texas. It's been a real inconvenience to make multiple trips to the dealership for the same issues without resolution. Short story long...I'd buy something other than a Honda CR-V if I were in the market today.",neg

"I purchased my 2017 Honda CRV Touring AWD in June 2017. The day I went to take delivery the salesman was doing his walk around with me and showing me how to operate the car. They were all ready to let me drive off the lot when I pointed out that the drivers seat bolster was malformed and deflated. The mechanic comes out and says they never saw anything like that. So I take the car home and make an appointment to drop it off so they can disassemble the seat to find out what is wrong. After 3 days they get the parts and put the seat back together. I go to pick it up. They seat is ok. Not perfect and the nice tan leather interior is covered in black greasy hand prints. So they bring another guy out to clean it. Which should have been done before I even got there. Fast forward 6 months and it is time for the 5000 mile check up and oil change. I tell them I have been hearing lifter noises and a strange whining from the transmission. After an hour in the waiting room they take me out to the garage to show me the underneath of new car covered in some kind of fluid that is leaking from somewhere under the motor. They dont know what kind of fluid it is. So I have to leave my car while they try to figure out what is wrong with it. A week later I get a call saying they think it is oil and it is the rear main seal. They tell me it was probably like that since my last change, at which time I point out that this is the first oil change on my new car so they say it was probably installed wrong at the factory and has been leaking like that since I got it new off the lot. They also tell me they dont know what they sounds are that I was hearing. So I guess I was hearing things! 3 weeks later they finally have the car back together and are going to drive it for 50 miles and make sure that there is no more leak. I opened up a case with Honda Motor Corp. because I have serious doubts about the reliability of this vehicle since it has been like this since the factory how do I know what kind of damage it has suffered internally? They mechanics say they didnt see any metal chips in the oil but I still dont trust them. I will be getting rid of this car. I dont trust. Honda Quality has gone right done the toilet.",neg

"Bought a 2015 Honda CR-V to replace my wife's 14 yr. old car. They both ride about the same but unlike the old car ( not a Honda) the CR-V has numerous problems at just over 1,000 miles. The problems include vibrations at idle and low speed driving up to 60 mph and also on deceleration. The dealership initially acted as though it was something uncommon among this model and even stated the CR-V Is not a luxury car, but merely a runabout or errand car and you'll have some vibration. They eventually admitted there is a problem and no current fix.

The rear brakes were making noise and the rotors were scored. The dealer decided to save some money by machining the rotors instead of replacing them with new ones. The Service Advisor claimed they machine new rotors out of the box and they are somehow better than new. They also claimed to have replaced the rear pads.

"I purchased this car in April, and notified the dealership within the first week that there was a vibration.  They acted like I was crazy, they'd never heard of such a thing.  My car now has 5800 miles on it, and the vibration has gotten worse.  You can feel the vibration through the steering wheel, the passenger seat and the drivers seat usually at 2000 RPM and at 1000 RPM.  It also vibrates at idle, but not consistently.  The vibration at 2000 RPM becomes very pronounced at highway speeds around 70-75 MPH.  It feels like driving on rumble strips.  I've had the car back into the dealership 3 times.  I've even tried a different dealer to see if they would be more honest about acknowledging the problem.  My experience has been the same each time:  The service manager tells me that the ""slight"" vibration is a normal characteristic of the CRV.  They say that I'm the only customer out of the thousands that they've sold this car to who has complained about the vibration.  They say that they haven't even heard of the 2 Youtube videos released by Honda Corp. acknowledging the vibration and claiming that it's their top priority to fix it.  They say they know nothing about a software update from August addressing the mode 3 vibration. (which doesn't work)  They say that there is nothing wrong with my car and that the performance falls within normal specs.  They say that the ""normal"" vibration is not a safety issue.   They tell me that what I'm feeling is feedback from the road conditions.  

If it wasn't such a huge financial fiasco for me, this would be funny.  Apparently I know more about the 2015 CRV issues and Honda's response than any sales person or service tech in my area.  They drive the car and tell me they can't feel anything except road feedback.  It's beyond frustrating.  Of course they offer to sell me a different car, but I'll have to take a hit on my trade in.  

If this is the new normal for Honda, then this 25 year Honda customer will be moving to a different manufacturer.  DON'T BUY THIS CAR.  Don't you think that if Honda believed the vibration was normal they would have already had the 2016's on the lot?  When's the last time they released the new year model AFTER the 1st of the year?  There's a reason Honda has delayed the release of the 2016's.  It's a serious problem, NOT a normal characteristic.",neg

I have not been disappointed. This is my 4th Toyota. I think so far its the second best I've owned after my 2004 Tacoma, also really liked my Rav4 sport 6cyl (FAST!). I bought the Highlander last year after having back surgery and really, really looked into what type of SUV would work best. I was having trouble getting in and out of lower vehicles and I needed something that was comfortable due to the extent of my surgery. (bad bike accident) I test drove probably around 15 vehicles before making my choice for the Highlander, so it beat the competition for me on price and value. I am a business owner who drives a lot hauls around a team to techies (5 of them) and is always going to events where I need to haul a Booth (and techies). This thing does it all and recently I have been getting above 25mpg on the highway. City normally around 16mpg. I got through this past winters snow storms thanks the the AWD with snow up too almost 2 feet only got kinda stuck once while driving through a snow drift for fun (I haven't matured fully). Threw on the center diff lock thingy, and it drove right out even with its semi crummy tires. Ride: Pretty good, not as good as my old range rover(2001) good but it doesn't disappoint. I like the sure footed-ness and not to bouncy ride quality. I honestly don't think about it much and that's a good thing. I liked it more than the competition in some ways. Handling: Isn't bad for a larger vehicle but I think it could be better with a more premium set of rubber. I have had a bit of fun on some back roads and have gotten it to oversteer a few times when pushing to hard in a corner. (again crummy tires partially at fault). I don't recommend turning of traction control unless you are a driver who knows how to push the weight of a vehicle like this around corners. All in all it handles a little better than expected but your not going to be beating anyone at the track. (probably best not to try in general) Acceleration: Is pretty good, but for someone who's last vehicle did it in less than 5 secs it seems a bit slow. I actually tested it with a buddy one day and got 6.6 to 60mph which isn't bad for a big lug. I think its gotten better now that the motor is broken in. I was surprised since its 1 second faster than posted. No I wasn't trying on a down hill. It gets on the freeway well and I can pass with ease. I beat my friend in his Audi A4 in a silly drag race. General Driving Dynamics: On a daily basis this thing is fine. Nothing jarringly bad about it. Nothing super impressive either. Its just solid and gets me through the day with out feeling exhausted from driving. Sometimes I wish for more power and better handling but its not really the vehicle for that but a bit more is always nice. Interior: Great! Everything I need. I got the LE Plus trim. I don't need to many fancy things. I hate most GPS's so I am happy to use my mobile phone. I like the way the dash is laid out with the shelf for odd items or smartphones, but sometimes the screen is hard to read in if the sun is coming in at the right angle. Bluetooth works well most people don't know I am talking and driving to them at the same time. All the controls on the wheel are easy to use and in the right places. Controls on the dash are a bit hard to reach with out leaning a bit forward. May be tough for shorter drivers. Seats are great and comfy (main reason I bough it). Tons of room for you and your stuff. Great if you need to drive more than 5 people around. Way back is a bit tight and only small friends or kids should go back there. I don't have kids so I can't do the stroller test but I am planning on that so its ready when they come along. Exterior: It looks ok,from some angles it looks odd overall good design and I don't feel like I am driving a mommy wagon. I got the silver and its a good color. I don't look at it from the outside and its not a show car, so to me it doesn't matter much. To each their own in this department. Disappointments? I don't really have to many. I sometimes wish for a bit more power and quicker steering. I don't like that the options are all over the place with trim levels. I didn't mind spending more but I didn't want a sunroof heated seats or leather. Wish the larger center screen came with the LE Plus version and those cool led lights below the fog lights. Also extra interior lights would be nice but you can only get those on higher trims. Its a bit dark inside when you are getting stuff out at night. I have left things in it since I can't see them. You can't add what you want but I got enough for what I need. Thinking about asking the dealer mechanics if I can add a few things through the parts department. (if its not to pricey) Conclusion: Probably great for anyone wanting a vehicle they can run forever. Abuse with kids or techies, Get through snow and be comfortable and compliant. I drive cars hard and all my Toyota's have never complained or failed. They are the best daily drivers and are good at being reliable transportation. This Highlander is no exception I hope to get 300k miles on this thing. My girlfriend loves it and thinks its the best vehicle we have had and her favorite to take long trips in. (we road trip a lot) Thanks for reading my rather long review hope this helps and is useful for your consideration in choosing a midsize SUV. (pick the highlander) Cheers!",pos
The transmission will not go into park about 50% of the time.  Since it doesn't always do it it is easy to continually make the mistake of thinking park=park then backing up a few inches before realizing it.  This 'feature' killed someone so they recalled and instead of fixing transmission (and admitting flaw) they added a feature where your car cannot back up with the door open.  So it still happens but can't kill you.  The 'capless' gas tank doesn't work at 75% of gas stations and I had to hold the black rubber pressure catch on gas nozzle to pump gas.  Nearly every time I got gas.  The performance of the vehicle is nice but these other items ruined the entire experience of driving every time I got behind the wheel.  Additionally the AC makes constant noise like there is an issue with the freon but was told ' just kind of happens' by the dealership.  Traded it in last week for a VW GTI and am soooo glad even though I lost thousands on value on the Jeep.  LEMON,neg
It seems to have more room for storage in back than many of the SUVs we drove. It has zip and feels like it really hugs the road. We have had some pretty icy conditions on and off this winter and this car feels so secure.   No issues in the year and a half I’ve had it. I have to say that I still think it was a great buy. I love my car!,pos
Absolutely incredible!!!  I can't say enough great things about this car!!!I wish I would have gotten one YEARS ago!!  Will never be without one and I will convert ALL my friends!,pos
"So i bought my Honda CRV 2015 EX on December 1st.  I was so excited, and first time I buy a new car.  I didn't want to deal with headaches from used car, who knows what problems they have. When I test drive the CRV, I tried all the functions in the car, and they seems to be pretty good, I got a good deal on the price, and i bought it.  However after i drive it everyday from home to work, and i live in New York.  I have to deal with stop signs or traffic lights every couple blocks.  The car just vibrates like crazy when i'm in D mode and brake pressed.  The shake is pretty violent, and after i research everyone is having the same issue. Man i really wish i did my research first, now too late.",neg
"I moved from a 2014 Crosstrek Hybrid to this car.  The MPG is comparable, but it is much roomier.  The head unit and audio is way way better in this model than in my previous Subaru, and the cabin is pretty quiet.  I do have a couple of small complaints:
1.  You cannot mute the audio in the NAV system, and it breaks into the music versus talking over the music.  For me, this makes the NAV system too annoying to be used, and I end up using Google Maps instead.  According to Subaru customer service, this is not something that they are planning on fixing.
2.  The Bluetooth microphone seems to pickup a lot of noise, especially during highway driving.  People on the other end say it is quite annoying to listen to.  I have tried adjusting the mic volume, and it doesn't seem to help much.
3.  The EyeSight cameras remove the area where you can store sunglasses, and make the rear view mirror a little challenging to adjust.  They also should have blind spot available in this like it is in the Outback/Legacy.  
This is our 4th Subaru, and the reliability of the prior 3 has been exceptional.  I expect this will be the same.
All in all, I would definitely recommend this car.  It is our 4th Subaru, and",pos
"I just got honda CRV 3/2015
2nd day I found the car shaking, Honda don't know how they fix it, no actions from the dealer, you cannot return it, or get a credit ..........Nothing!
NO DEAL!!!!
I didn't recommended for any !!!",neg
after paying close to 50K the dealer can not still find whats the problem with the idle stop and navigation. since first day the navigation signals bars are in red  sometimes in green but when is in red it looses actual location. I live in washington DC so I expected to have the green bars all the time.  the iddle stop does not work after 1800K it stop working. If someone has the same problem please let me know,neg
"Shop around for the best deal.  Just like the last Highlander, this vehicle is excellent.",pos
"I traded my 2015 RX350 for the 2016 Pilot EXL. The RX was loaded with every option available and the Pilot is stock but I would never trade back! The ride is far superior and the handling is perfect for me, it steers like an arrow. There is less road noise and vibration than the RX had and the seats are far more comfortable. The interior is spacious and attractive with plenty of cargo room. If I have to complain about anything it's that the driver seat seems a little lacking in range of motion compared to the RX. in my opinion there should be just a little more forward tilt to the seat. I have to set the seat in a lower position than I like to compensate for the lack of tilt because if I sit higher the front edge of the seat presses hard into the back of my leg causing it to feel numb. I'm getting used to sitting lower. I like the back up camera that comes as a standard option, again it's better than the RX and the signal light rear view camera is also a great option, it makes changing lanes safer than just a shoulder check. I would recommend this vehicle to anyone.
I think the speakers could be better, I have the EXL model and am planning to have the speakers replaced with a higher quality.

Almost two years later and I like it even more than I did when I bought it and have had no problems whatsoever with the pilot. Recently took it on a road trip and the gas mileage I got was great! The seat was a bit stiff at first but after a few months has become much more comfortable, I don't even think about it anymore. Love it!",pos
"My wife likes it, I think the steering can be improved, seems to wobble. vehical seems top heavy, sways, seems like it could upset, jerkey turning",pos
"For the most part, the 2015 Highlander is a nice car. After driving it for 2 days, I noticed a noise (faint) but you can hear it when there is no music playing or fan is off. 

I took it to the dealership and they said this is by design. The sound is like a hard drive resetting or on overdrive. 

Situation:
When the Auto for temp is on or off, there is an intermittent revved or overdrive sound coming from the temp console. 

I checked with similar model and voila there is that sound. 

Piercey Toyota technician stated ""Normal Serval Motor Changing Mode"" 

I don't know if Toyota would build such a product with ""defect"". ",neg
"The Subaru name says it all. I drive for my job and this vehicle provides comfort, reliability, and style.  The 2 tone interior is why I fell in love with the car. It is stylish and unique.  A great car to call my office while on the road.",pos
"that thing vibrates when idling ,and also on low speeds ,very  disappointed ,also have 2013 honda accord with same motor and transmission and no problems like that,hopefully honda will fix this soon,but for now people stay away from this car",neg
"I have a 2016 with a HEMI, Platinum pack and Rear entertainment system. Holy smokes is all I am going to say. I drove this one first and then drove an Audi Q7, Acura MDX, BMW X6, and Lexus GX460. This has the most stuff/options for the lowest cost of them all and has the biggest engine and the nicest interior (The MDX interior is a close second and the Audi handling is a close second). I am loving it so far!",pos
"I have had my jeep into the dealership for transmission issues 4 times.  The dealer couldn't fix the transmission so they replaced it.  The new transmission is not much better and Jeep is unwilling to rectify the situation.  I am now forced to file a case with NCDS in an attempt to resolve this matter.  Looking at lemon law with a lawyer.  The vehicle has less than 3,000 miles on it.  This is the worst vehicle I have ever owned in 30+ years.",neg
"The Infotainment System is the most frustrating, poorly designed, inaccurate and  user ""unfriendly"" system on the market!",neg
"I was in the market for a mid-sized SUV and shopped online for either a Toyota Highlander or a Honda Pilot.  I had purchased my Honda CR-V EX from Carbone Honda of Bennington, VT the last time I shopped for a vehicle and after a lot of online comparisons from multiple dealerships, I decided to try Carbone Honda in Bennington once again because I knew they were also a Toyota dealership so I could make side-by-side comparisons of the two vehicles.  My salesperson, Rob Albreada was superb in describing the pros and cons of both vehicles.  Because the Pilot's interior was slightly larger than the Highlander (Rob actually measured both interiors with the rear seats folded down), I knew the reliability of Honda products, and the overall look and feel of the vehicle, I decided to purchase the Pilot.  I have had two lengthy trips in the Pilot since buying it and have been extremely happy to have made the choice I did.  The Pilot boasts of 18-26 with an average of 21 mpg but on each trip with the ECO Boost engaged I actually got 28.9 mpg.  The Honda Lane Watch (passenger side camera) when passing vehicles makes it much safer to know it's ok to pull back into the main traffic lane.  The same goes for backing up in reverse with the rear camera.  Overall, this was the right choice for me.",pos
"Very happy with my Pilot.  My last SUV was a Saturn Outlook, which I was able to get 200,000 miles on. Pilot, in my opinion, looks great. The ride is outstanding and quiet. I upgraded on the stereo, was a little disappointed that it doesn't really rock when I crank it. I did a lot of research and test drives.  If you are a bigger guy (6-2 +) this is a great ride.  It feels larger in the hip and shoulder area.  Also, it has more headroom.  The legroom was a little less than my Outlook.  I like to stretch my legs out to ride.  I know I am rambling.  Just wanted to say that I am very happy with my purchase and would encourage you to test drive.",pos
"This is my fourth SUV I have owned and by far the best. Quality great, Power (295 HP V6), Ride, handlels great and Quitness is unbeliveable, just the right size I am a big man and I am very comfortable while driving. I do not need the third row seat so I foleded it down and it gave me plenty of room for my large dog. One other thing Great Gas Mileage.",pos
"I can't seem to get anywhere with customer care so I am going to share my story in hopes of saving others from my misfortune with the newly designed Honda Pilot. I bought a 2016 Honda Pilot last February.  Last week, my air conditioning began to blow warm air.  I took it to a Honda dealership for a diagnostic assessment assuming that whatever was wrong would surely be covered under warranty with a car that is barely a year old.  I get a call stating that they aren't really sure and it may have been that a rock hit my condenser and that is not covered.  The dealership stated  that they see this all the time and it is in ""a vulnerable place at the front of the car.""  I have hit absolutely nothing and have never even heard of such a possibility happening on any other car I have owned.  The fix is $1200 on a basically BRAND NEW CAR.  Please be aware of this design flaw in the new Pilot and purchase something else.  This is the first and last Honda I will ever own as I have been let down and feel as if I have been swindled by the company.  The Economy employee said that the condenser does have a screen which meant the pebble must have been tiny.  So, apparently the tiniest of pebbles can take out an entire air conditioner in a Honda.",neg
Great vehicle for pulling small travel trailer or tent trailer.,pos
Bigger inside than it looks from the outside. Handles great. AWD is awesome. Good mileage. Good standard features.,pos
